That must have been the biggest challenge for this musical adaptation of the hit 1985 film about Marty, Doc and the time-travelling DeLorean, which has to achieve that ferocious velocity to tear back across the decades to 1955. Kudos to the production for pulling off the effect so spectacularly.\nIt really does seem as if the DeLorean is defying the laws of theatre, if not the time-space continuum. The effect is created through a plethora of screens, graphic projections (video design by Finn Ross) and a firework of illuminations (lighting design by Tim Lutkin) that sear beyond the proscenium arch and into the auditorium with the most dazzling illusion of depth at the back of the theatre as well. It sparks a shower of light and colour that, in its magnitude, looks little short of the turning on of the West End‚Äôs Christmas lights.\n Continue reading...",

The film‚Äôs title comes from a track of the same name on Iggy Pop‚Äôs 1996 album Naughty Little Doggie, which is a ‚Äútribute‚Äù to one of the most famous ‚Äúbaby groupies‚Äù on Sunset Strip in the 70s, Sable Starr. ‚ÄúI slept with Sable when she was 13 / Her parents were too rich to do anything / She rocked her way around LA / ‚ÄôTil a New York Doll carried her away.‚Äù Words are not deeds, of course, though Starr did run away from home to live with a member of the Dolls in NYC at 16, and knew Iggy Pop at that time.\n‚ÄúSo many little girl songs,‚Äù notes Kari Krome, songwriter and co-founder of the Runaways. She was a witness to and frequent victim of the exploitation by older men of young girls who came to Hollywood; she recounts a rape and an assault, and you sense that this is merely the tip of her personal iceberg of trauma. Look Away is built round extensive interviews with her, the Runaways‚Äô bass guitarist, Jackie Fuchs, and Julia Holcomb. Holcomb met Aerosmith‚Äôs frontman, Steven Tyler, when she was 16, became his lover, ward (he got her mother to sign over custody so he could cross state lines with her on tour without being arrested), and fiancee in that order.

It was, presumably, never the intention of the architects of Brexit to inflict a similar kind of psychological pressure on British citizens living abroad with non-UK spouses. But bureaucratic indifference and a signal lack of compassion are turning hitherto ordinary lives upside down in Kafkaesque fashion.\nAt the weekend, it was reported that a British woman needing to return to the UK with her French partner had been forced to come without him, much to the distress of their six-year-old son, who wants to know when he will see his father again. Before Brexit, of course, a family move such as this would have been straightforward. But in yet another example of performative cruelty when it comes to Britain‚Äôs borders, the Home Office has introduced a complex family permit to cover such cases.

Raducanu, from Bromley, beat the 19-year-old Canadian, Leylah Fernandez, in the first grand slam final between two teenagers in 22 years. It was a momentous occasion that has made Raducanu into Britain‚Äôs brightest new sports star almost overnight. And while we should share in the collective joy of her remarkable triumph, it is also worth reflecting on the meaning of Raducanu‚Äôs heritage.\nA Mandarin speaker, she was born in Canada to a Romanian father and Chinese mother, arriving in the UK at the age of two. In other words, Raducanu‚Äôs migration story is Britain‚Äôs migration story: varied, global and drawing from multiple cultural legacies. Yet how much do we in the UK really value the lives of immigrant families such as the Raducanus, when, instead of achieving greatness on the world stage, they‚Äôre living ordinary lives, often in the roles of the low-paid essential workers who keep the country running?\n Continue reading...",

Not much has changed since the 1980s, says Steven Walker\nAnother story about the lack of help for troubled children (Sharp rise in acute medical beds occupied by children with nowhere else to go, 13 September) fills me with a sense of deja vu and despair. After 35 years in child protection and child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) as a social worker and then psychotherapist, I‚Äôve seen the same story time and time again. A few weeks ago it was the crisis in local government children‚Äôs services, and in April the Royal College of Psychiatrists reported the risks children faced, with record waiting times for Camhs help.\nBut this was happening back in the 1980s when we were struggling with overwhelming demand for family support services to prevent child abuse and the deterioration of children‚Äôs mental health. Tory libertarian ideologues have succeeded in hollowing out state services, and presided over unnecessary austerity cuts that have proved a false economy. The result is that a generation of neglected children and disadvantaged families have developed much more serious, damaging and expensive chronic problems. Until the needs of our future citizens are acknowledged and supported, the inevitable consequences in antisocial behaviour, self-harm, suicides, declining school attainment and family trauma will continue.\nSteven Walker\nWalton-on-the-Naze, Essex\n Continue reading...",

Like most people, he has matured over the past year, a journey from carelessness to panic to pragmatism. The journey was never about ‚Äúfollowing the science‚Äù. It was following the politics by cherrypicking the science, as with the initial decision over herd immunity. First the cry was herd immunity, then it was test and trace, now it is vaccination. And it is vaccination that has given Johnson his window back to normality. He owes a mighty debt to pharmacological science.\nThe cabinet, still drenched in the new Tory authoritarianism, is reportedly not ready to dismantle the grim edifice of the 2020 emergency Coronavirus Act, licensing the government to control crowds, detain and surveil the public, in order to stop the pandemic. The act needs renewing every six months and is now coming due. Johnson has acknowledged the public‚Äôs exhaustion with the controls that have dictated life in Britain for the past year and a half. They have forced him to ban families from their loved ones‚Äô deathbeds, empty our mountains and beaches, and cripple a million livelihoods, all for the sake of bureaucratic one-size-fits-all.

According to Dr Ryan Dougherty, from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, the more television you watch in middle age, the lower your volume in grey matter. Examining the viewing habits of 599 American adults between 1990 and 2011, Dougherty found that those who watched an above average amount of television showed reduced volume in their frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex.

But a new generation is fighting back\nWhen Florence Schechter opened the Vagina Museum ‚Äì the world‚Äôs first museum dedicated to gynaecological anatomy ‚Äì in London in 2019, it was partly a response to a dramatic rise in labiaplasty surgery. Instances of such surgery more than doubled in the first decade of this century, then carried on climbing. Zoe Williams, the spokesperson for the museum (who shares my name), says part of the problem is that most women have not seen other vulvas. ‚ÄúQuite a lot of people have never even seen their own, so it‚Äôs hard to have a concept of what‚Äôs normal. Certainly, throughout art history, the pictures of nude women very seldom had any protruding labia; you just had a neat little cleft.‚Äù\nLabiaplasty is surgery to alter the appearance of the vulva ‚Äì generally by trying to reduce the size of the labia minora, the inner genital lips, so that they don‚Äôt hang below the labia majora, the outer ones. The reasons for such surgery are not solely cosmetic ‚Äì they could be related to childbirth, or chafing during sport ‚Äì yet the rise is staggering. The number of labiaplasty surgeries in 2016 was up 45% on 2015 ‚Äì the biggest growth of any cosmetic surgery procedure, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.\n Continue reading...",

Her ranking of 366 severely limited the level of tournaments she could directly enter, so her modest plans were to compete in lower-level $25k ITF tournaments and to slowly build her ranking.\nAnd so, as she basked in the glory of an unprecedented grand slam title run in New York that shocked her as much as anyone else, those plans destroyed for good, it made sense she was determined to enjoy every last moment of her success. When she was asked in her press conference to reflect on how her life will change and the superstardom to come, it was the very last thing on her mind.\n Continue reading...",

It would last a decade and claim well over a million lives; 36 million people were hounded, including Xi Jinping‚Äôs father, who had previously been a senior leader. The current president was himself denounced and spent years living in bleak rural poverty.\nUnsurprisingly, Mr Xi has spoken scathingly of the Cultural Revolution in the past. Yet many now see growing echoes of the era. The Communist elders who survived the disaster sought to cage the power of the leader through consensus and new conventions. Under those, Mr Xi would be expected to step down as general secretary of the party ‚Äì the role that gives him real power ‚Äì next autumn, after 10 years. But putative successors have been sidelined or ousted, and dismantling term limits for the presidency, his other position, was a clear sign he plans to continue.

But the canon is only a reflection of the limits of our knowledge; vast swathes of ancient literature do not survive, and there are whole realms of cultural activity that never even got as far as a manuscript, leave alone the opportunity to withstand history‚Äôs vicissitudes. New research suggests that there was a substrate of more demotic, more everyday verse that has remained largely invisible to modern eyes.\nProf Tim Whitmarsh of the University of Cambridge has examined a short verse that survives not because it was copied down by Byzantine monks, preserved through the medieval age then ‚Äúrediscovered‚Äù in the Renaissance, like much canonical classical literature, but because it was inscribed into semi-precious stones as cameos, and, in one instance, scratched on to a wall as a graffito.\n Continue reading...",

Yet it‚Äôs due to end within weeks\nAs the days get shorter and autumn slowly comes into view, you can feel it: a deep sense of public foreboding, perhaps best summarised as the growing realisation that business as usual is turning out to be nothing of the kind.\nPeople‚Äôs anxieties are focused on everything from the closure of the furlough scheme to the fate of an increasingly under-pressure NHS. But for millions, there is no greater source of worry than the end of the so-called ¬£20 weekly ‚Äúuplift‚Äù to universal credit. Scheduled for 6 October, it‚Äôs now being confirmed in messages sent via online benefit accounts, and sowing the kind of cold fear that defines far too many British lives.

Perhaps the worst manifestation is the UK‚Äôs three-month delay in using the approved vaccines to protect children aged 12 to 15. Last week, Dr Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden, gave a lecture to a UK public health society.

First, children spread the virus; second, we see cases of severe Covid disease in the young; and third, we don‚Äôt know the long-term effects of infection in children.

The overall cost of the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù can be gauged in many different ways ‚Äì in terms of international development, arms spending, environmental impacts, civil and human rights, the rule of law and the balance of power. Yet most striking is the cost expressed in ordinary lives lost and ruined.\n Continue reading...",

In the years before Mayor Giuliani‚Äôs zero-tolerance crackdown on crime, and the advance of gentrification, the city was a place of maximum tolerance, where anything could happen at any moment. For Watkins, who had specialised in photographing the ironies of Englishness and its traditions, this was both a challenge and a liberation.\nThat summer, he recalls, in a monograph of his pictures from that time, ‚Äúboth the city and myself were out of money and there was a sense of danger on every corner. Emerging from the subway on to Fifth Avenue for the first time I was assaulted by the humidity, stench and magnitude of that canyon. It was like stepping into Springsteen‚Äôs Born to Run album. Garbage and broken people filled the streets as I walked the same sidewalks as my photographic heroes and drank Dr Pepper to replace the sweat.‚Äù There were moments where the energy of the streets coalesced ‚Äì ‚ÄúDemocratic Convention rallies and Iranian hostage demonstrations added extra visual opportunities,‚Äù Watkins recalls, but it was the unpredictability of those streets that he remembers most clearly.\n Continue reading...",

One way is to borrow an idea from Ben Thompson, a veteran tech commentator who doesn‚Äôt suffer from it, and whose (paid) newsletter should be a mandatory daily email for any serious observer of the tech industry.

Each one weighed as much as a sheep and, shaped like a body bag, could feasibly have contained one. As the Belgian police opened the first bag, a stack of crimson bricks slid out.

I was due to fly back the evening of 11 September 2001, and only had one show to cover that day, so I treated myself to room service (so grownup) while I watched one of those morning news shows that are really just celebrity interview shows, interspersed occasionally with the headlines. I was delighted when the guest that morning was Tracey Ullman, whom I‚Äôve always liked. So there I was, eating my breakfast, listening to Ullman, feeling content with the world and totally in control of my life. Then the next interview started, with someone who had written a celebrity biography, and the presenter suddenly interrupted proceedings.

(The title and setup slightly spoil the first joke, where he arrives as if he is a detective, only to slap down his tray of solvents and cloths.)

Here, she is at peak HBC ‚Äì dishevelled, reaching for madness, and in a stylishly oversized coat.

That evening, the historian Tony Judt wrote that he had seen the 21st century begin. The nearly 3,000 lives stolen by al-Qaida were only a small part of the toll. The horror began a chain of events that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, including huge numbers of civilians abroad and many US military personnel. It is still unfolding.\nIf the killing of the plot‚Äôs mastermind Osama bin Laden a few months before the 10th anniversary perhaps let some hope that an end to that new era might be in sight, there can be no such false confidence at the 20th. The establishment of a Taliban government in Kabul, two decades after the US ousted the militants for harbouring Bin Laden, has underscored two things: that far from reasserting its global supremacy, the US looks more vulnerable today; and that the echoes of 9/11 are still reverberating across the region ‚Äì but will not stay there.\n Continue reading...",

Without research driven by curiosity, there would be far fewer breakthroughs\nIn Gulliver‚Äôs Travels, Jonathan Swift mocked the assumption that the scientific revolution had transformed European culture for the better. The satirical novel, published in 1726, has its eponymous hero stumbling upon ‚Äúthe Academy‚Äù in the fictional city of Lagado, and pokes fun at the idea that a scientific temperament could be useful. Swift describes pointless experiments to extract sunbeams from cucumbers and to build houses from the roof downwards. His book is laced with sardonic wit. But unorthodox, even absurd, thinking is necessary for science to progress.\nThat point has been underlined by this week‚Äôs winners of the Ig Nobel prize, established in 1991 by an American magazine called the Annals of Improbable Research. One of the honoured investigations this year was by Robin Radcliffe, of Cornell University, who looked at whether it was safer to transport an anesthetised rhinoceros upside down airborne or lying on its side on a sledge. Prof Radcliffe showed animals‚Äô health would not be jeopardised by being hung by their legs beneath a helicopter, a technique becoming more popular in African conservation.\n Continue reading...",

But another lasting and insidious change took place: the death of the high street. By approving the building of residential homes on ailing shopping streets, planning minister Robert Jenrick effectively allowed any shop, restaurant, cafe or business premise in England to become a house. Since almost everywhere houses make more money, this puts every high street under threat.\nAlthough done in the name of creating ‚Äúthriving town centres‚Äù, Jenrick‚Äôs policy will strip away the cohesion that still binds many communities together, urban as well as rural. The diversity of English towns and cities has long been protected by planners enforcing classes of use. Restaurants and shops could not simply become houses without planning permission. But as of last month, if any landlord thinks to profit by turning the use of one building into another, it will require no permission to do so. A building need only to have been vacant for three months (after Covid-19, this already applies to one in seven shops, and could easily be achieved by eviction). Hit by lockdown, online shopping and the end of rental holidays, high street shops are struggling to survive. They need time to recover, not Jenrick kicking them in the teeth and sending their landlords cheering to the bank.\n Continue reading...",

In conversation with Nosheen Iqbal, they look back at the past two decades and ahead to what the future holds for Britain‚Äôs Muslims\n\n\nThe 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that we have been reflecting on in Today in Focus had a particular effect on Britain‚Äôs Muslim communities. For many, the shock and outrage they felt was quickly followed by fear of reprisals against them. What followed was a relentless demonisation in some parts of the media, abuse in the streets, and legal measures such as control orders and the government‚Äôs Prevent anti-radicalisation programme that appeared to target their communities. \n Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan was raised in Leeds in the 1990s as a Muslim, the eldest child of second generation British Pakistani parents. She describes striving to fit in at school and do all that was asked of her, eventually winning a place at Cambridge University and going on to become a successful poet. But she tells Nosheen Iqbal of her realisation that nothing she did could insulate her from subtle ‚Äì and overt ‚Äì Islamophobia.

The studies also reflect broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism.\n Continue reading...",

Memories of their lives prior to this mysterious co-dependency are played out in superbly inventive movement sequences ‚Äì from tender duets to manic raves ‚Äì triggered by a radio signal that becomes increasingly distorted.

Those are the only remaining obstacles separating Novak Djokovic from becoming the first male player to win the calendar-year grand slam since Rod Laver in 1969 while also winning his 21st grand slam title, breaking his tie with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But as he rounds on his final hurdles, standing before him are the most difficult tasks to come. On Friday he will face the surging Alexander Zverev in the semi-final, and if he wins possibly Daniil Medvedev, the second seed, in the final.\nOver the course of the summer, Zverev, the fourth seed, has come to represent the biggest source of friction in Djokovic‚Äôs historic season. Just over a month ago, the Serb was seemingly powering towards his elusive Olympic gold medal and he led Zverev 6-1, 3-2 in the semi-final with a break of serve. But then, in a flash, it was gone. He lost 10 of the next 11 games and after starting the match with a 22-match winning streak, he lost three matches, two each in singles and one in mixed doubles, within 24 hours, as well as pulling out of the mixed doubles bronze-medal match. He left Tokyo exhausted. ‚ÄúI played great, great tennis. Then unfortunately [my] game fell apart. It happens,‚Äù he said on Wednesday about the loss against Zverev, after his four-set win over Matteo Berrettini.\n Continue reading...",

The amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by this new machine will be tiny: 4,000 tonnes a year, which is equivalent to that produced by 870 cars. Still, the project brings a step closer the possibility that significant amounts of carbon dioxide could, one day, be removed from the atmosphere.\nThe significant risks that such technological developments carry must be addressed head-on. The danger is that they are a displacement activity from the massive and necessary task of reducing and then eliminating emissions (with any residual emissions offset or, if carbon capture technologies are scaled up, removed).

I was just discovering my sexuality and how we relate to other human beings and this book blew my mind. I remember a section about ‚Äúdisplacement reactions‚Äù, something you do when you‚Äôre nervous or uncomfortable and you‚Äôre trying to divert the conversation elsewhere. I used to do this strange thing with my legs. I‚Äôd shake them and rub my thighs. It was very odd and friends used to comment, but through understanding it I was able to curtail my unconscious behaviour. The book changed the way I looked at everybody and I‚Äôve been fascinated by people-watching ever since.

Armond begins the six‚Äëpart series, The White Lotus, determined to do his job well, to please all the necessary people. But, as catastrophe spreads, his eyes glitter, his mood changes and it is clear propriety is about to be set aside. His descent from assured, capable, sober hotelier to rogue manager, high on drugs stolen from two teenage guests, set on sabotaging a deeply unpleasant honeymooner, is spectacular ‚Äì and probably the TV moment of the year.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The blunt-edged, security-oriented approach allows little space to tackle the root causes of violence and find resolution\n\nSophie Haspeslagh is an assistant professor in political science at the American University in Cairo\n\nIn the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States spearheaded an international campaign to contain the threat from militant groups, like al-Qaida, by encouraging states to blacklist ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù groups. Perhaps the most significant part of this effort was the passing of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (UNSC 1373), on 28 September 2001. Twenty years later, the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan is just one example of how this heavy-handed anti-terror strategy failed.\nThe global blacklisting regime has not only failed to contain the Taliban but it has also made it harder to end wars across the globe. Resolution 1373 encouraged member states to set up their own blacklists to sanction the support of terror groups. But in the absence of a UN definition of what actually constitutes ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù, the resolution led to states identifying suspects in light of their own national interests. Beyond al-Qaida and the Taliban, armed groups as diverse as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the Communist Party of Nepal, the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party in Turkey, the Communist Party of the Philippines and Hamas in Palestine were listed as terrorists. \n Continue reading...",

Just as one continental plate might push beneath another in sudden fits and starts, causing periodic earthquakes and tsunamis, our atmospheric systems will absorb the stress for a while, then suddenly shift. Yet, everywhere, the programmes designed to avert it are linear, smooth and gradual.\nCurrent plans to avoid catastrophe would work in a simple system like a washbasin, in which you can close the tap until the inflow is less than the outflow. But they are less likely to work in complex systems, such as the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. Complex systems seek equilibrium. When they are pushed too far out of one equilibrium state, they can flip suddenly into another. A common property of complex systems is that it‚Äôs much easier to push them past a tipping point than to push them back. Once a transition has happened, it cannot realistically be reversed.\n Continue reading...",

Burke had already reported extensively on the terrorist network, travelling in Afghanistan as he sought to understand its motivations and command structure. Dean knew firsthand what Osama bin Laden‚Äôs agenda was: he had met the terrorist leader twice, and trained as a bombmaker in Afghanistan before turning and becoming a spy for MI6.\nIn this episode, the second of three examining the reverberations of 9/11 20 years on, Michael Safi asks Burke and Dean how al-Qaida developed the capacity for an attack that would change the course of history.

The simple tragedy of 70 people dying in one night ‚Äì two more thereafter ‚Äì when a tower block caught fire is terrible enough. The story of how and why it became the inferno it did, capable of unleashing such devastation, is presented as one of such moral failure and ugliness that if you hadn‚Äôt witnessed it unfold you would half-believe it was a fable for our times.\nBut we did witness it. First in the headlines and the contemporary footage of the fire itself as ‚Äì in the early hours of the morning of 14 June 2017 ‚Äì it spread rapidly from a fridge in a fourth-floor flat up the outside of the recently refurbished 1970s block in west London. Then in the reports of the deaths ‚Äì including 18 children, a quarter of all the young people who had lived in the tower. And then in the Grenfell inquiry, which confirmed that it was the exterior cladding, changed from the proposed type to a cheaper, more flammable kind that enabled the rapid spread of the flames and the production of toxic gases (which spread easily due to a lack of fire doors fit for purpose) ‚Äì without which, one must presume, the death toll would have been lower.\n Continue reading...",

At the start of the second episode of the revived franchise there‚Äôs already a body impaled on railings, and a cop (Will Patton) gushing blood on the ground. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) ‚Äì horror cinema‚Äôs original Final Girl, now Final Grandmother ‚Äì is being rushed to hospital, and her house is in flames. But indestructible killer Michael Myers has decided to make a night of it, and is out there armed with a firefighter‚Äôs axe, axing firefighters.\nForty years after John Carpenter made the defining slasher movie, director David Gordon Green has made a creditable stab, as it were, at reanimating the title. Green is an occasional indie auteur (George Washington, Prince Avalanche) who leads a double life as a mainstream stalwart, and showed in his 2018 Halloween reboot that he‚Äôs more than competent at straight genre thrills. Writing again with Danny McBride, here joined by Scott Teems, Green offers a functional but enjoyably efficient follow-up. It kicks in only minutes after the events of the previous episode, and pretty much follows a straight line, apart from brief flashbacks to 1978, with even a passable Donald Pleasence lookalike on hand to lend authenticity.\n Continue reading...",

On current polling, the popular though polarising former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva would beat him easily in 2022‚Äôs election. Mr Bolsonaro is acting accordingly. The president has already sought to cast doubt on electronic voting, and limited the power of tech companies to remove content ‚Äì making it harder to tackle disinformation.

          "description": "Public attitudes to spending have shifted since austerity, yet the opposition seems to be championing low taxes\nFor decades, many on the left have hankered for the social democratic political settlement of other European countries. Britain, it has been said, should ditch Thatcherism once and for all, and embrace higher taxes as the means of improving public services.\nNow it has happened. As a result of the new health and social care levy, taxation will rise to its highest sustained level on record. This is the work not of a party of the left but of one of the right. Rishi Sunak may say he is a fiscal hawk who favours a small state and low taxes, but he is a tax-and-spend chancellor. Sajid Javid may have a picture of the Iron Lady on his office wall, but he is a tax-and-spend health secretary.\n Continue reading...",

Buried on the same day was the news that departments are being asked to plan 5% cuts to ‚Äúnon-priority‚Äù services each year until 2024. Within just weeks the furlough scheme is set to be dissolved, with an estimated 1.9 million staff still being supported at the latest count. And by October, 5m households relying on universal credit will face the deepest overnight cut to welfare in UK history. It‚Äôs a cruel start to the government‚Äôs new parliamentary term. Expect the phrase ‚ÄúBrexit dividend‚Äù to keep a low profile this autumn.\nThe latest reforms have provoked a sense of unfairness around the treatment of generational wealth and income. In today‚Äôs Britain, how you make your money matters. If you rely on earnings for a living, the government has asked that you contribute an extra 2.5% of your wages towards the costs of social care ‚Äì ultimately the 1.25 percentage point increase to both employee and employer NICs will each come out of workers‚Äô take-home pay.

          "description": "Food banks and volunteers have put into practice the universalist principle that once underpinned the welfare state\nWhen Slung Low theatre in Leeds closed during the first lockdown in March last year, its five core staff decided to stay put. The publicly funded theatre had cash and a van, so the staff leafleted the theatre‚Äôs neighbourhood in Holbeck, an impoverished area in south Leeds, offering to help with everyday tasks that had suddenly become impossible for many people. Requests piled in for grocery shopping, dog-walking and prescription pick-ups. As workplaces closed, people started asking for food support. Before long, the local council approached Slung Low, which normally stages large-scale theatre shows in castles and town centres, to organise a food bank for a ward of 7,500 residents. So it did, supplying around 15,000 deliveries over 15 months: thousands of eggs, cereal boxes, tins of beans and pints of milk.\nSlung Low‚Äôs food bank was, like its theatre performances, a large-scale production. But it was by no means the only initiative of its kind to emerge during the pandemic. Over the past 18 months, 4,000 mutual aid groups formed across the country, staffed by millions of volunteers, who patched together safety nets for those in need. Whether delivering food, helping elderly people or supporting those with deteriorating mental health, many mutual aiders fast realised that help is a two-way street. For some, it provided an immediate way to practise political values. Other volunteers I spoke with said it offered them meaning and purpose in a way that actual, paid work did not.\n Continue reading...",

I chose not to chase the drama of the burning flames, but rather to seek out their aftermath. I encountered endless blackened landscapes and made these portraits of people whose lives have been destroyed by the fire they describe as a ‚Äúburning hell‚Äù. I know that it was not easy for my subjects to return to their homes to be photographed, and for some this was the first time that they had stepped inside since the fire. However, I found that they embraced this moment of having their fractured situation witnessed and were keen to share their stories. I was moved by their openness to my camera after all the horrors of their recent experience. Visually I found that an eerily precise symmetry seemed to emerge from the unspeakable chaos of their ruined homes, many of which are situated in places of profound beauty. I hope that their gaze at the camera will provoke a visceral sense of the climate threat we all face.\n Continue reading...",

Abortion clinics in the state have estimated that the law bans somewhere between 85% and 90% of the procedures they provide.\nBut perhaps the most shocking part of the law is how it‚Äôs enforced: SB8 is enforced not by the state attorney general or other government officials, but by private citizens, who are encouraged to snitch on people who violate the abortion ban by filing civil lawsuits against them. (And they are promised a minimum of $10,000 in ‚Äúdamages‚Äù if they win the suit ‚Äì what abortion rights supporters are calling a ‚Äúbounty‚Äù.)

          "description": "The boost to health and care spending is needed, but troubling details, and unfairness, remain\nIn 2019, in his first speech as prime minister, Boris Johnson promised to fix the crisis in social care ‚Äúonce and for all‚Äù. Two years later, a plan has arrived as part of a mishmash announcement that also tries to address the enormous problem of demand facing the NHS, and rising anger about intergenerational unfairness. The best part of Tuesday‚Äôs news is the money: around ¬£12bn a year to be shared between health and social care for each of the next three years. This is likely to be a broadly popular measure; polls show that the public is willing to stump up taxes to pay for a better service. And the NHS desperately needs it, with waiting lists at their highest ever levels in England.\nTo achieve this, the prime minister has calculated that his MPs, and voters, will swallow the pill of broken manifesto promises. This includes the announcement that the pensions triple lock will be removed next year, as well as the 1.25% rise in national insurance contributions plus 1.25% from employers that (along with a tax on dividends) is the mechanism chosen to deliver new funding. With the proposed cut to universal credit, 2.5 million working families will shell out ¬£1,300 a year. From 2023-24 when government systems have been updated, payslips will show a ‚Äúhealth and care levy‚Äù, including those of workers over the state pension age (who until now have been exempt from NI). By branding the portion of the new money that will be channelled to the devolved administrations a ‚Äúunion dividend‚Äù, the government hopes to bind them to the UK.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "A government proposal to ease restrictions on the sale of imported cultural works risks harming a world-class industry\nThe hoopla around the release of Sally Rooney‚Äôs new novel on Tuesday ‚Äì with bookshops opening early, and queues of shoppers eager to lay their hands on Beautiful World, Where Are You ‚Äì has contributed to the image of a publishing industry in rude health. Last year had the highest sales in eight years. Yet authors, bricks-and-mortar bookshops and publishers alike fear that the industry faces a powerful new threat, if cheap editions legitimately produced for an overseas market are allowed to be sold in the UK. Kazuo Ishiguro, Bernardine Evaristo and others have warned that the effect on writers would be devastating.\nEU regulations meant that UK producers could prevent the importation of such books into Britain; in the wake of Brexit, the government is considering reversing this. A report proposes to change how we deal with the exhaustion of intellectual property rights. The document, from a taskforce headed by Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and George Freeman, argues that, apart from limited exceptions, ‚Äúin general, protectionist use of IP rights should be resisted‚Äù. It suggests that we liberalise parallel import laws ‚Äúto reduce prices and increase choice for consumers‚Äù (in notes from a familiar Tory hymn sheet). This would mean that a non-UK publisher, say, that has legitimately bought the rights to publish Harry Potter, could then sell those books back into Britain. Where they are cheaper, reflecting lower costs and consumer incomes in those markets, the original producers would be at a disadvantage.\n Continue reading...",

It didn‚Äôt work out\nOn the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to ‚Äúdefend and promote freedom in all its dimensions‚Äù. From behind a large lectern, Friedman ‚Äì grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century ‚Äì laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.\nFriedman called it seasteading: ‚ÄúHomesteading the high seas,‚Äù a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he‚Äôd founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (‚ÄúIf you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,‚Äù he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!‚Äù he declared.\n Continue reading...",

This appears vindictive revenge on the commission because it dared to do its job.

I started my working life in the 1970s, when the average tax for low- and middle-income earners was 40%-50%. This compares with the 20% currently being paid. My generation paid this high rate gladly, on the assumption that we were investing in a health and welfare system that would protect us from birth to grave. All of us pensioners deserve every penny we are receiving, as we have paid our fair share.\nSurely, the focus of our egalitarian concerns should be the top earners whose tax has dropped from 75%/83% in the 70s to 45%.

Road transport shares with the social care industry an enduring culture of increasing profit by reducing costs, with frontline workers paying the price. Both transport and care are now dominated by agencies, which seem to do little for the pounds of flesh that they extract from staff and clients. Unsurprisingly, people prefer to earn a living in other ways.\nThere are about 600,000 people holding LGV cat C (rigid truck) or cat C+E (articulated lorry) licences in the UK who do not currently drive trucks for a living. Why would they want to return to the job? Facilities are poor, the hours brutal and the responsibilities onerous. And these are only going to get worse. The latest changes to the highway code appear to make truck drivers entirely responsible for the stupidity of childish ‚Äúvulnerable road users‚Äù who are now being encouraged to treat the road as a playground while ‚Äúadult‚Äù drivers look after them.

Neither of us knows a huge amount about German politics. I have some pretty good intel, from a podcast I made, that everyone standing is deeply disappointing, and nobody should win. My Mr, by contrast, has decided that Olaf Scholz represents real change. Every morning, he delivers the poll ratings. The party has gone from being 20 points behind to five points ahead. It is impossible to guess why this makes him so happy. I floated the idea that maybe he was divining some parallel uptick in Labour‚Äôs fortunes. But he said no, he just really wants to see the Social Democratic party surge to victory. From the heavy significance of his voice and eyebrows, I managed to pick up that it is my responsibility to deliver on this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible,‚Äù I said ‚Äì I am, after all, totally abreast of the polls. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs impossible for me to make this happen.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else I want.‚Äù\nThe other thing he urgently wants is to see a zoo full of bonobos.

He thinks I can make this fly by describing the matrilineal society of bonobos, and how well they model the community ideal, of pure pleasure and cooperation, when the females are in charge. I counter that we could also model this ideal, put me in charge, I‚Äôd leave the kids at home, and we could enjoy the zoo, just the two of us, and that would be a Perfect Day.

In May this year, she announced her decision to take time off because of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a parliamentary culture in which even MPs who have to give birth or have chemotherapy are surrounded by endless discussion about whether they can still do their job, this was a momentous act, signalling to many that Whittome belonged to a new, more honest culture. Angela Rayner, Labour‚Äôs deputy leader, said at the time that her colleague had ‚Äúshown so much bravery and ‚Ä¶ will have helped so many other people‚Äù, a view shared by many Conservatives. But Whittome wasn‚Äôt thinking of the career angle. ‚ÄúMy symptoms were getting worse rather than better.

It‚Äôs both an income tax and an employment tax; it‚Äôs regressive; it‚Äôs not paid by those above the state pension age; it incentivises the construction of imaginative subcontractor avoidance schemes; and it requires its own collection and recording scheme.\nWhy not, in the name of efficiency and fairness, abandon NI and replace it with simpler taxes on income and profit? This would ensure that those with the broadest shoulders bear the greatest burden (since income tax is progressive). It would widen the tax base ‚Äì income, whether through work or a pension, becomes liable for tax, independent of the age of the recipient, and employers become subject to tax by reference to the profits they earn, rather than a headcount of employees. Of course, headline rates of income tax will jump, but the resulting tax would be more fairly spread across all taxpayers (particularly because replacing a regressive with a progressive tax ensures the less well-off pay less).\n Continue reading...",

These plans, and the availability of land at the Watford site, mean that this is by far the best option, with no need to purchase huge parcels of land or navigate the more complex planning legislation around building on greenfield.

Some days, I thought I‚Äôd never cut through the brain fog brought about by living through a pandemic. But gradually, as the initial panic subsided and the usual distractions of daily life fell away, I found the words did start to come, and the process of writing my second book was much more fluid and focused than my first.\nWhich is hardly surprising. I started my debut while on maternity leave with my second baby. I had dreamed of writing a novel since I was a child. I was one of those bookish kids whose weekly highlight was a visit to the library and who spent the best part of my teens squirrelling away short stories and beginnings of novels that never seemed to go anywhere. When I moved to London after my English degree, I joined a writing group and started a thriller.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "What makes a pub special? From the perfect place to flog atomic secrets to the official strictly protected viewpoint for St Paul‚Äôs, a new book tells the amazing stories behind the city‚Äôs greatest bars\nWhen you stumble out of the medieval warren of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub on Fleet Street, it‚Äôs easy to think you‚Äôve had one too many. As you gaze east towards the dome of St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, the skyscrapers of the Square Mile appear to lean back in a woozy limbo, as if lurching to get out of the way.\nIt‚Äôs not the effect of the real ale, but the result of a curious planning rule. The City of London‚Äôs policies have long specified the pavement outside this particular pub as the hallowed spot from which Wren‚Äôs dome must be perfectly visible against the sky. Even the towers that stand behind it to the east, like the Cheesegrater and the Scalpel, derive their strange chamfered forms from having to preserve a sacred gap behind the cathedral‚Äôs silhouette, when seen from outside the pub.\nTrace the lines of London‚Äôs historic protected views, and you‚Äôll find that many of them end up outside pubs. It reflects not just the fact that the surveyors enjoyed a pint or two, but the central importance of the public house in shaping the history of the city ‚Äì a phenomenon that is celebrated in a new book.\n‚ÄúThere are already so many books about pubs,‚Äù says David Knight, co-author of Public House with Cristina Monteiro. ‚ÄúWe wanted this one to be different. It‚Äôs not a guide to the best places to have a pint but a collection of social and cultural histories, trying to bring together a more diverse range of voices to explore the value of pubs to the city and society.‚Äù While the majority of pub literature may be of the stale white male genre, this compendium includes South Asian Desi pubs, African-Caribbean pubs, and a range of pubs that have played a role in LGBTQ+ history.\n Continue reading...",

The number of people taking flights fell by three quarters compared with 2019 levels and as a result there was a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. But as countries open up and people begin to fly again, aviation is expected to see a slow climb back to previous levels. The industry anticipates a return to 2019 passenger numbers globally by 2023 and to be back on track with previous growth projections within a couple of decades.\nAll this is bad news for the planet. CO2 emissions from the industry are likely to triple by 2050. But if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C, it needs to have hit net zero CO2 emissions by this time.

Or at least they are if they are well-run, which rules out the two Spanish giants and several clubs in Italy.\nThe transfers of the two players who have defined football for a generation understandably generated great excitement, with fans camping out at the airport in Paris to welcome Lionel Messi and queuing round the block to buy a shirt with his name on the back while Manchester United‚Äôs share price rose by almost 10% on the news of Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs signing before falling back slightly. That will excite executives and seem to vindicate the outlay, although whether those upticks are sustainable enough to pay both players‚Äô vast wages is less certain.\n Continue reading...",

It occurred to me that would be quite an interesting way to tell the story of one particular family. The promise itself also arrived from a friend, who was telling me how his mother had asked the family to give a certain piece of land to the black woman who had looked after her through her last illness, as it happens in the book.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "A 1943 melodrama offers one of the best portraits of a single woman Hollywood ever drew\nOut in the world again, I‚Äôve seen a lot of new exhibitions and a bit of new theatre, the heart going out to those actors who, in spite of great reviews, are still taking curtain calls to the sound of too few hands clapping. But in the end, the cultural highlight of my summer had nothing at all to do with novelty. At a BFI cinema on London‚Äôs South Bank, I saw Old Acquaintance, a melodrama of 1943 starring Bette Davis, and thought, not for the first time, of a line by the film critic, E Arnot Robertson, who wrote in Picture Post: ‚ÄúI think Bette Davis would have been burned at the stake as a witch if she had lived three or four hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet.‚Äù\nThe BFI‚Äôs Bette Davis season, now sadly over, was bliss: an embarrassment of riches to be enjoyed in the velvety dark, preferably with a surreptitious hip flask of something strong (the bars are still closed). But what to choose? Old Acquaintance, which is about the love-hate relationship between two women who‚Äôve been friends since childhood (Miriam Hopkins co-stars) is a pretty awful movie, the high-tide mark of the ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs picture‚Äù of the 1940s. But I love it for two reasons. The first is that, in Davis‚Äôs character, a writer called Kit Marlowe, we have one of the most sympathetic portraits Hollywood ever drew of the single woman. The second is for Davis herself, who turns in a performance so extravagantly good, she might be in a different film altogether. The patrician voice. The oyster eyes. The sheer command of every emotion from yearning to ambition. On the way home, my jaw ached: the effect of having spent almost two hours with it wide open in amazement.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Ten years after village doc Le Quattro Volte, Michelangelo Frammartino returns with an observational piece centring on a deep-cave system in Calabria\nIn 2011 Italian artist Michelangelo Frammartino scored a small indie hit with a film called Le Quattro Volte, a metaphysical study of a mountain village that featured bleating goats and ringing bells, charcoal burners and Roman centurions. Le Quattro Volte was odd and gentle and by and large people loved it. I‚Äôm not sure how much money one earns from a small indie hit. Probably enough to pay for a weekend break in Tropea. Now Frammartino is back ‚Äì 10 years later, not wanting to rush things ‚Äì with the lovely Il Buco, another film that is content to saunter on the wild side, gazing at woods and sky, rocks and trees and identifying a serene, quiet heaven in everything that it sees. It‚Äôs not quite a documentary, yet nor is it exactly a narrative feature. It lives alone; the cinematic equivalent of a hermit on a mountaintop.\nFrammartino‚Äôs last film was inspired by Pythagoras. This one takes its prompt from a 1961 potholing expedition in Calabria, mapping out a labyrinthine cave system which was confirmed at the time as the third deepest in the world. The film shows the cavers descending its slick twists and turns and uncovering an old photo and a damp magazine with JFK on the cover. Whatever item slips into the crevasse instantly becomes history, or a lost memory; a teasing remnant of the people who once walked above.\n Continue reading...",

But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does so, and more. Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, is canny enough to realise that the key to success with an effects-driven, eye-popping extravaganza is not the CGI spectacle, it‚Äôs the basic stuff. Textured characters. Karaoke and shots-fuelled friendships. And electrifyingly badass fight choreography.\nIn the goofy exchanges between Simu Liu‚Äôs Shaun (heir to his father‚Äôs tricky relationship with power, and his mother‚Äôs fierce empathy) and his best friend, defender, drinking buddy and fellow valet car-parker Katy (Awkwafina), the film is already one of the freshest Marvel pictures in a long time.

So I find myself increasingly having this conversation ‚Äì usually with a friend, but sometimes with a nice woman I bond with at a party or somesuch ‚Äì and it goes like this: she always assumed she would have kids, but she didn‚Äôt meet the right partner in her 30s, and actually it was fine because she was so busy with her career, and who can afford kids anyway? But now she‚Äôs 40 and while she‚Äôs not desperate to have kids, she‚Äôs also not that keen on losing the option. It kinda sucks being the only one among her friends without kids, when the WhatsApps are full of Hey Duggee chat, and what will happen to her when she‚Äôs old? Will she be all alone? So should she have a baby now? I look her right in the eyes and I tell her what I always tell women in these circumstances: don‚Äôt bother.\nI need to clarify two things here. First, this is in no way a reflection of my feelings about my own children, whom I genuinely cannot imagine my life without, even though I lived for almost 40 years without them. That your life becomes entirely about your kids once you have them is not proof that‚Äôs how life should be ‚Äì it‚Äôs a reflection of what kids are like. It‚Äôs strange how often people confuse the cause and effect here. I can only assume it‚Äôs done mainly by parents who are trying to reassure themselves that they definitely made the right life choices when they realise that, for the next eight years, their weekends will no longer be about seeing their friends, but consist entirely and only of shepherding their kids to playdates and making awkward small chat with random people who just happened to have had kids around the same time as you.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The shadow of the departing chancellor looms over a contest too close to call\nIn September 1998, when a relatively youthful Gerhard Schr√∂der defeated Helmut Kohl and ended his 16-year reign as German chancellor, the victorious leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) told supporters that the country had opted for ‚Äúa change of generation‚Äù. Mr Schr√∂der‚Äôs triumph turned a page on the cold war era, aligning Germany with a fresh-faced centre-left resurgence in western democracies led by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. It was, in the political vernacular, a quintessential ‚Äúchange‚Äù election.\nAlmost a quarter of a century later, Angela Merkel will stand down of her own accord later this month ‚Äì the first chancellor to do so ‚Äì after equalling Mr Kohl‚Äôs longevity in office. But this time, ahead of a 26 September election, German voters seem to be somewhat reluctant to move on. None of Ms Merkel‚Äôs prospective replacements come close to matching her popularity. Fewer than one in five see the chancellor‚Äôs own preferred successor, the CDU/CSU candidate, Armin Laschet, as the best option to replace her. Caught on camera laughing during a visit to a town devastated by floods, Mr Laschet has fought a lacklustre campaign and has become a liability for his party. A poll last week found that from highs of around 35% at the start of the year, the CDU/CSU‚Äôs ratings have plunged on Mr Laschet‚Äôs watch to the low twenties and fallen just behind the SPD for the first time since 2006. The Greens electrified the contest by topping polls in the spring. Their extraordinary surge seemed to embody a widespread desire for a more environmentally driven politics to meet net zero pledges. But they too have lost their mojo as the party‚Äôs candidate for chancellor, the inexperienced Annalena Baerbock, struggles to recover from allegations of plagiarism and financial mismanagement.\n Continue reading...",

As Zhang landed blows and harassed the Raducanu forehand, the rallies lengthened and the intensity became more pronounced.\nIt was at Wimbledon two months ago that the match intensity against another top-100 player, Ajla Tomljanovic, proved too much for Raducanu, leading to her retirement from their fourth round match due to breathing problems.

Texas residents must now add out-of-state travel to the many barriers that already exist to getting an abortion. There has been an outpouring of support for Texas women from people in the UK and European Union, but it‚Äôs worth remembering that while the UK and Europe are an abortion utopia compared with some American states, abortion access is still not guaranteed.\nLet‚Äôs start with the UK. Due to the herculean efforts of activists (and despite the best efforts of a foot-dragging, anti-abortion government), Northern Ireland now has limited access to legal abortion. But Alliance for Choice, the campaign group in Northern Ireland, says that proper access to abortion is still not guaranteed across the country. Women are still waiting for the department of health to commission abortion services, telemedicine and more types of available abortion. Currently, the majority of abortions happen in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and are performed with pills, which carry a small risk of failure. Because there is virtually no provision for abortions after the first trimester, people seeking these services are still forced to travel to England.\n Continue reading...",

You couldn‚Äôt do so much as a tour of the playground without someone thinking she would be a great addition to a skipping cartel, British bulldogs or a plot. She also had great hand-eye coordination, so, even without her character, her qualities would have been in high demand. This meant I had a medium-level phobia of playgrounds, which I managed as best I could by hiding it and praying for rain.\nSo this day, not the memorable day, was shaping up as badly as it possibly could. She was asked to join in with a game of rounders. I was spectating, shooting murderous looks at anyone who cheered her or in any other way sought her attention. A teacher joined in, Mr Gubbins. I probably shouldn‚Äôt name him in case I‚Äôve misremembered, but it was 40 years ago and he has a funny name. Let‚Äôs say it was him or it wasn‚Äôt.\n Continue reading...",

Are those fears justified? What‚Äôs the chat like at the service station plug-in points? And why did that gull have to relieve itself on a loaned Skoda Enyaq just before the photographer showed up?

The critics are in uproar; the ushers get lairy. Wherever he is, I imagine that Schrader himself would approve of the show.\nOn screen, The Card Counter provides another stylish, slow-burning account of Schrader‚Äôs lonesome samurai, a figure who can crop up in all walks of life: as a taxi driver, an escort, a drug dealer, a priest. On this occasion he‚Äôs embodied by a blank-eyed Oscar Isaac, who wears his scuffed leather jacket like a bulletproof vest. William Tell (formerly Tillich) is a veteran of Abu Ghraib and served eight years for his crimes. He now earns a living at the card tables and roulette wheels of middle America. The film has him driving the strip malls at night or prowling the stygian bowels of interchangeable casinos, with their patterned carpets and heavy black drapes. These joints have lights blazing everywhere and yet always appear cloaked in shadow. The gamblers, one worries, bring the darkness in with them.\n Continue reading...",

The combination of torrential rain and thunderous wind had battered spectators, toppled refreshment stands and even led to it raining indoors under the Louis Armstrong Stadium roof. Play was suspended across all but the Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nAs the tennis restarted the one sight that remained entirely unchanged was the joy and confidence that Emma Raducanu carried with every ball she struck as she continued her rise. In her fifth match at her debut US Open, and against by far her most accomplished opponent, the 18-year-old treaded even deeper into the unknown by thoroughly outplaying Zhang Shuai of China 6-2, 6-4 to reach the third round without dropping a set.\n Continue reading...",

To many, it understandably feels like the beginning of the end ‚Äì denying women the rights enjoyed under the landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which established that abortion is legal before the foetus is viable outside the womb, at around 24 weeks. It will further embolden the religious right. Though polling suggests the majority of Americans believe that terminations should be legal in most or all cases, this is already the worst ever legislative year for restrictions.\nBut it is better understood as the end of the beginning. The right to abortion has, in practice, been systematically dismantled through methods ranging from intimidation to cynical regulation. This moment is the culmination of the first stage in a decades-long war on the rights of women, made possible by Donald Trump‚Äôs appointment of judges known to support restricting reproductive rights.

In the last decade, independent school income has raced away while state school spending per pupil in England, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has seen the largest cut ‚Äì 9% in real terms ‚Äì in over 40 years.\nThe thinktank has sifted the wheat from the government‚Äôs rhetorical chaff. Even with Boris Johnson‚Äôs promised extra ¬£7bn in state school spending, per-pupil expenditure in 2023 will still be ‚Äú1 to 2% lower in real terms‚Äù than in 2010.

Afterwards, he would say ‚Äì not wholly joking ‚Äì that Maradona saved his life.\nMore than three decades on, in the middle act of a career that has already won him an Oscar, the Italian film-maker has retraced his steps, turned back the clock and fashioned this foundational horror into a fevered coming-of-age tale, a movie that played to a capacity crowd here in Venice.

Despite the performance of his operas, symphonies and songs in some of the major concert halls of Europe, Theodorakis remained, for many, the man who wrote the catchy bouzouki music of Zorba and the Costa-Gavras film Z.\nFor those who remember the 1967-74 military dictatorship in Greece, he was also a symbol of resistance to that regime. But Theodorakis was much more than a political symbol and a writer of film scores. He was a composer of great melodic gifts: he composed more songs than Schubert and the best of them ‚Äì his settings of Lorca, Seferis, Brendan Behan, Kambanellis, Elytis and Ritsos ‚Äì do not suffer by the comparison. It may be that his other works will one day occupy a place in the repertoire of 20th-century classical composition, but his songs will undoubtedly remain the most enduring legacy of the man known to his friends simply as o psilos ‚Äì the tall one.\n Continue reading...",

According to a report by NHS Kidney Care, ‚Äúmore than 1.8 million people in England have diagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, there are thought to be around a million people who have the condition but are undiagnosed. CKD can substantially reduce quality of life, and leads to premature death for thousands of people each year.‚Äù\nMost diagnosed kidney patients must strictly limit their intake of potassium as an excess of this element in the body can lead to stroke and sudden heart failure. As the report states, the most ubiquitous substitute for sodium chloride (common salt) is potassium chloride. Therefore, far from preventing strokes and heart attacks, such a widespread substitution could cause many thousands of extra such occurrences among patients with significantly reduced kidney function. As a kidney dialysis patient, I believe that this fact should be made widely known among the public, but particularly among potential policymakers.\nJohn Rippon \nWitton Gilbert, County Durham\n Continue reading...",

The isolation of Covid will only make this worse\nRead a book, as the old saying goes, and it will set you free. But even the power of literature surely has its limits, and this week a judge in Leicester tested them. Faced with a Nazi sympathiser convicted of downloading bomb-making instructions, and white supremacist and fascist material from the internet, Judge Spencer issued a suspended two-year sentence and instructions to read Jane Austen or Charles Dickens instead. ‚ÄúThink about Hardy. Think about Trollope,‚Äù he added, helpfully. Shakespeare‚Äôs Twelfth Night, the judge thought, might be a good place to start.\nIt might have made more sense had he recommended Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland. For Ben John, the 21-year-old former student convicted of downloading more than 67,000 extreme documents, seems to have fallen down a depressingly familiar dark rabbit hole. The judge described him as a lonely individual with few, if any, proper friends. He fits a well-worn pattern of socially awkward, angry young men retreating from the outside world into dark online subcultures, where each click leads to something more extreme. For John, it was white supremacism and fascism. For others it could be Islamist fundamentalism, or a violently misogynistic incel culture, where men who can‚Äôt get women to have sex with them vent their frustrated rage against women everywhere.\n Continue reading...",

That‚Äôs five more golds than the golden couple of British Olympic cycling, Jason and Laura Kenny.\nWhen Storey tackled her first Paralympics aged 14, as a swimmer in Barcelona, cycling was a Cinderella sport. Chris Boardman‚Äôs gold medal in that Games was a glorious aberration, and the ‚Äúmedal factory‚Äù in Manchester ‚Äì which now seems as if it has been there for ever ‚Äì was not even a gleam in the eye of its founder, Boardman‚Äôs then-coach Peter Keen; it began life five years later.

I knew the 11-plus was important, but had no idea how pivotal it was to be. Taking the exam was completely routine. Nobody I knew had special tuition for it ‚Äì or if they did, I didn‚Äôt know about it. \nAlthough my parents were devout Labour voters, the debate about grammar schools had passed them by. They had no idea that good socialists were not supposed to send their children to grammar school, let alone sit the 11-plus. Like generations of immigrants before them, and generations still to come, they believed passionately in education. Education was the means by which we, the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation, would fulfil our parents‚Äô dreams and aspirations. So, if going to grammar school meant you got a good education, my parents believed that it must be a good thing.\n Continue reading...",

Between Xi Jinping‚Äôs public acknowledgment of the coronavirus outbreak on 20 January 2020, and Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration as the 46th president of the United States precisely a year later, the world was shaken by a disease that in the space of 12 months killed more than 2.2 million people and rendered tens of millions severely ill. Today the official death tolls stands at 4.51 million. The likely figure for excess deaths is more than twice that number. The virus disrupted the daily routine of virtually everyone on the planet, stopped much of public life, closed schools, separated families, interrupted travel and upended the world economy.\nTo contain the fallout, government support for households, businesses and markets took on dimensions not seen outside wartime. It was not just by far the sharpest economic recession experienced since the second world war, it was qualitatively unique. Never before had there been a collective decision, however haphazard and uneven, to shut large parts of the world‚Äôs economy down.

And borders were to become one of Raymond Williams‚Äôs key subjects. In all kinds of senses: borders of space and time and class and in personal relationships. Yet what made Williams one of 20th century Britain‚Äôs most important cultural critics was his refusal to take any of these boundaries as unchanging and fixed. The son of a railway signalman got a scholarship to Cambridge, was sent to fight in the invasion of Normandy in 1944, before ending his days in the 1980s writing novels about the Black Mountains as often as not from his home in Essex. He moved about politically, too, starting in the Communist party and ending in Plaid Cymru. Often ranked, rightly, among Wales‚Äôs greatest writers, he had a lot to say about place without ever being narrowly parochial or dogmatic.\nHis early masterpiece The Country and the City opens by observing that the ‚Äúcontrast between country and city, as fundamental ways of life, reaches back into classical times‚Äù ‚Äì before swiftly tearing down that divide by taking the reader through 400 years of English literature and showing how these two supposed archetypes changed meaning and association again and again. In the wake of the Brexit vote, politicians and scholars have paid attention to place like rarely before, jawing on about the ‚ÄúRed Wall‚Äù, ‚Äúleft-behind places‚Äù, ‚ÄúCambridge versus Clacton‚Äù and any number of other brittle stereotypes that are crying out for a Williams-style demolition.\n Continue reading...",

As a former wages inspector, I well remember Margaret Thatcher and other rightwingers‚Äô arguments for the abolition of the wages councils that set minimum rates in traditionally low-paid and usually non-unionised industries. Their arguments were basically the same ‚Äì that it would increase inflation.\nIt is surprising to me that so many people who I suspect consider themselves to be leftwing are opposed to poorly paid workers improving their pay. Inflation does not have to be a consequence of increased pay. When the wages councils introduced yearly pay increases, there was no subsequent increase in inflation. This was because the rates were still quite low compared to the average pay rates throughout the country as a whole. The decision to abolish the wages councils was purely ideological on the part of the government. We have legal minimum rates at the moment without any detrimental effects on inflation, and giving low-paid workers a decent increase will make very little difference.\n Continue reading...",

Rising temperatures are exacerbating water shortages. In Iraq, temperatures are estimated to be rising as much as seven times faster than the global average. Countries in this region are not only uniquely affected by global temperature rises: their centrality to global oil and gas markets makes their economies particularly vulnerable to the transition away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources. It‚Äôs essential the voices of Iraq and similar countries are heard at the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow this November.\nTo stand a chance of limiting the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it produces and consumes energy, burning less coal, oil and natural gas. The International Energy Agency‚Äôs recent global roadmap to net zero by 2050 shows the world‚Äôs demand for oil will need to decline from more than 90m barrels a day to less than 25m by 2050. This would result in a 75% plunge in net revenues for oil-producing economies, many of which are dominated by a public sector that relies on oil exports and the revenues they produce.\n Continue reading...",

At least seven journalists have been physically assaulted while covering these rallies, six of them by rightwing demonstrators.\nAttacks on the press are just one part of escalating rightwing street violence in the city, which has included multiple stabbings, people being sprayed in the face with bear Mace, an assault on a breast cancer patient outside a clinic, and repeated physical brawls with leftwing protesters in the streets. In another sign of growing tensions, protesters rallying against vaccine mandates showed up at the homes of two Los Angeles city council members on Sunday.\n Continue reading...",

In July 2019, the British ecologist co-authored a study estimating that Earth had space for an extra trillion trees on land not used for agriculture or settlement. Its implications were intoxicatingly hopeful. By restoring forests in an area roughly the size of China, the press release accompanying the paper suggested two-thirds of all emissions from human activities still present in the atmosphere could be removed. \nThe study, led by Jean-Fran√ßois Bastin, a postdoctoral researcher at Crowther‚Äôs lab in ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland, was the second most featured climate paper in the media in 2019, according to one analysis. It inspired the World Economic Forum‚Äôs (WEF) One Trillion Trees Initiative, launched last year after Salesforce billionaire Marc Benioff read the paper on the recommendation of Al Gore, the former US vice-president.

She is now six weeks into life as a free woman ‚Äì bar her mandatory meetings with her probation officer, Janice (Jo Martin, still lethally brilliant in a part that has been beefed up this go-round, surely in recognition of everything she did the first time) ‚Äì and things are ... OK. Miri is keeping her Tamagotchi alive, is taking driving lessons, is about to start a trial run as a supermarket employee and is still friends-with-benefits with neighbour Billy (Adeel Akhtar). The benefits are basically food-based (or, as Janice puts it, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even seen his cocky yet‚Äù). After last series‚Äô ice-cream cones, they move on in the first episode of the new to a sandwich lunch on the freezing Hythe shoreline. But the oh-so-gradual evolution of this, the daftest, tenderest relationship on television, is what makes it such a pure and painful delight. It manages to crush and swell the heart all at once.\nOn the other hand, Miri is still trying to come to terms with the revelations about her best friend Mandy‚Äôs (Christine Bottomley) involvement in the crime for which Miri served 18 years in prison, and her mother‚Äôs adulterous affair with Miri‚Äôs ex-boyfriend Dom (Jamie Michie); all while learning how to use the internet and smartphones, and restoring a bank account she hasn‚Äôt used for two decades. \n Continue reading...",

But its duties to Afghans endure\nThe histories are already being written, but for now, two moments encapsulate the closing moments of America‚Äôs longest war. One was the eerie, lonely night-vision image of the last US soldier boarding the military‚Äôs final flight from Afghanistan. The other came a day earlier, when a retaliatory strike targeting Islamic State reportedly claimed the lives of 10 civilians, including at least six children. Together, they convey the sense of hopelessness and waste, after almost 20 years and $2tn, the carelessness which too often characterised both the US presence and its withdrawal, and the costs to Afghans.\nThough Donald Trump set the clock for departure ticking, Joe Biden‚Äôs timing owed more to symbolism than pragmatism. The president promised that the US military would leave before 11 September ‚Äì the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terrorist attacks that led the US to topple the Taliban.\n Continue reading...",

But the weekly applause on doorsteps gradually faded away, as the nation found itself digging in for the long haul. The economic balance of power that had led to low levels of pay for people doing highly valued jobs remained fundamentally unchanged.\nWell over a year later, the delivery drivers, food production workers and other employees vital to Britain‚Äôs supply chains are back in the headlines. As parliament prepares to return from recess next week, a combination of the pandemic and the effects of Brexit has made labour shortages in these sectors one of the central stories of the summer. And for the first time in decades, it seems the politics of work and the balance of power in the labour market may be changing. Last month, the Unite union won a higher pay rise for beer delivery drivers after threatening strike action. Online shopping deliveries from companies such as Asos and Argos may be delayed if DHL workers vote to reject a 1% pay rise and take industrial action. Meanwhile, an array of bonuses, incentives and inducements is being offered by businesses in an attempt to persuade people to work for them.\n Continue reading...",

Ever since Before Sunrise, countless indie films have tried to ape the incandescent spirit of that 1995 classic, usually to middling results. Daniel Sanchez Lopez‚Äôs Boy Meets Boy is the latest unfortunately failed attempt, and once again reveals the achilles heel of these copycat projects. Before Sunrise might appear improvised but it has a tightly constructed script. Without good writing, watching random people walking around rarely makes for a good time at the movies.\nAt least the chosen location is charming enough. Having locked eyes the previous night at a club, Johannes (Alexandros Koutsoulis) and Harry (Matthew James Morrison), wander about on a sun-drenched day in Berlin, before the latter‚Äôs flight back to the UK. It‚Äôs the kind of brief encounter where the goodbyes pre-exist the hellos: the young men know they only have 15 hours together. Most of their conversations are spontaneous ‚Äì or try to be; they range from family life and jobs to, later, more personal subjects such as monogamy and open relationships. The issues discussed are interesting yet the subpar writing renders the pair‚Äôs opinions inconsequential, if not outright annoying. ‚ÄúQuirky‚Äù moments, such as Harry showing a film clip by Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl, only induce eyerolls.\n Continue reading...",

But to understand what may come next for both Afghanistan and the world, more attention needs to be paid to the tectonic shifts in the Arab and Iranian involvement in Afghanistan since the US-led invasion in 2001. Unless the regional contests for influence are accompanied by substantive and inclusive dialogue between these actors, turmoil will only increase for the country.\nIran‚Äôs changing role is a case in point. Tehran was once eager to get rid of the Taliban. In 1998, the killing of diplomats at the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif almost ignited a war. The murders took place in the chaos of the Taliban‚Äôs capture of the northern Afghan city. Tehran thus put the blame on the Taliban, which in turn pinned it on rogue elements. So it was unconventional ‚Äì but certainly not odd ‚Äì when Iran and the US emerged as implicit partners against the Taliban in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Tehran and Washington jointly backed the Northern Alliance ‚Äì an alliance of warlords that held 10% of Afghanistan ‚Äì as an anti-Taliban force.\n Continue reading...",

The old orthodoxy of free markets and hands-off government won‚Äôt cut it\nAs western economies emerge from the pandemic, their governments face a choice: do they seek to address the profound problems that Covid exposed, or try to return to ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù as quickly as possible? Their problem is that many of the issues exacerbated by the pandemic, such as wage stagnation, precarious work and rising inequality are not bugs in an otherwise well-functioning system, but inevitable outcomes of the way that western economies are now organised. So a business-as-usual approach simply won‚Äôt work. Much more fundamental change is needed.\nThe US government seems to recognise this. Joe Biden‚Äôs economic plans are a radical departure from the era that stretches from Reagan to Obama, when governments sought to keep taxes and public spending low and focused principally on globalised trade and the education and training of the workforce. Unlike his predecessors, Biden is pursuing large-scale public spending and taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to borrow for infrastructure investment. His stimulus plans target the climate crisis while creating green jobs and expanding health, education and childcare ‚Äì the ‚Äúsocial infrastructure‚Äù that is essential to the economy but has often been ignored by mainstream economists. \n Continue reading...",

It‚Äôs just that the closer you are to a person, the more absurd you find those rituals that directly follow their deaths. When my uncle died a couple of years later, I read at his funeral, in place of my mother, who didn‚Äôt want to. In a hurry, I just Googled, ‚ÄúWhat to read at funerals.‚Äù When I stood up to solemnly intone the Song from Cymbeline ‚Äì ‚ÄúFear no more the frown o‚Äô the great / Thou art past the tyrant‚Äôs stroke‚Äù ‚Äì it was the first time I‚Äôd ever set eyes on the words.

          "description": "Strategic failure has drastically reduced the west‚Äôs ability to influence the future course of events\nAs the final evacuation flights leave Kabul, watched in despair by those abandoned and in peril, the lasting consequences of strategic failure must now be faced. During the Doha peace talks, American diplomats liked to talk of a process towards an inclusive political settlement that would be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. The ‚Äúprocess‚Äù turned out instead to be a victory procession for the Taliban. What comes now will therefore be Taliban-led and Taliban-owned. Hamstrung as a result of their own mistakes, the United States, Britain and their allies have little choice but to engage with the new reality.\nBelated attempts are being made to do so from a supposed position of strength. As the last British forces left Kabul at the weekend, Boris Johnson adopted a stentorian tone to warn: ‚ÄúIf the new regime ‚Ä¶ wants diplomatic recognition or to unlock the billions currently frozen, they will have to ensure safe passage for those who wish to leave the country, to respect the rights of women and girls, [and] to prevent Afghanistan becoming again an incubator for global terror.‚Äù It seems clear that Taliban leaders hope to avoid the international pariah status of the 1990s and will soon be in desperate need of cash. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have suspended payments to Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, and the Afghan central bank‚Äôs reserves are frozen in the US. But the notion that, as China and Russia pursue their own agendas, the west can continue to call the shots and impose its terms is wishful thinking.\n Continue reading...",

That is no longer true. Smartphones, nuclear plants, medical scans and laser-operated doors have been built with insights from the physics that governs the subatomic level. What perplexes many is that the quantum world is governed by rules that run counter to classical notions of physical laws.\nIn quantum mechanics, nature is not deterministic. Subatomic particles do not travel a path that can be plotted. It is possible only to calculate the probability of finding these specks at a particular point.

It is also playing out its discussion via the media rather than in a timely fashion in private. Its doubts about vaccinating teenagers are said to centre on concerns about side-effects, the ethics of indirect benefit and of using vaccines here rather than overseas. The mRNA vaccines that would be used in this group have an excellent safety profile, and are the least suitable for use in developing countries because of storage temperature requirements. Boys are already vaccinated against rubella for the benefit of others (ie pregnant women). The debate is reminiscent of the early hesitation about mask wearing, where some scientists swerved away from their use on the plausible but unlikely grounds of other unintended effects on behaviour. These were not realised, and most of us now regret the delay in mask wearing.

When disaster lies all around, democracy craves a culprit, someone to carry the can. This past weekend has seen an orgy of blaming: of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, Dominic Raab (Britain‚Äôs foreign secretary), his ambassadors, Nato and the west generally, not to mention George Bush and Tony Blair. Afghanistan was supposed to be the ‚Äúgood‚Äù intervention, the one that worked. Yet the ‚Äúnation‚Äù we spent 20 years building has suddenly collapsed. Where are the architects?\nVictory has many parents, defeat is an orphan. Nothing looked as lonely this past weekend as ‚ÄúAfghan nation-building‚Äù. But whereas tyrants who fail can be toppled, democracy rightly diffuses responsibility. It is all very well accusing Biden or Johnson or their predecessors. We elected them. When things went well, the west trumpeted its values and patted itself on the back. It was so evidently superior.\n Continue reading...",

The coverage of the events has focused on Kim Kardashian dressed as a Balenciaga-clad sleep paralysis demon, $50 chicken tenders, potential Drake disses, levitation and cameos from alleged rapist Marilyn Manson and the homophobic DaBaby. Fans called West a genius capable of creating exciting theatre that evolves in real time; others saw him as an empty provocateur. Much like kindred spirit Donald Trump, West seems to instinctively know how to weaponise controversy to drive interest in a new project.\nWith the eventual release of Donda (named after West‚Äôs English professor mother, who died in 2007), there is a nagging sense the spectacle has overshadowed the actual music, with this bloated 108-minute album rarely sure of what it is trying to say. The intro, Donda Chant, a sequence of eerie recitations of his mother‚Äôs name seemingly designed to send you into a sunken place, is arresting, giving you the impression you‚Äôre about to undergo an immersive religious experience. But too often the songs that follow are built on half-baked ideas from a West more concerned with self-pity and martyrdom than confronting his contradictions.\n Continue reading...",

But despite the acclaim, Mvula was dropped from her Sony record deal ‚Äì via a forwarded email, no less.

It has long been venerated as a 20th-century Parthenon, the ultimate example of Mies‚Äôs pursuit of ‚Äúuniversal space‚Äù.\nBut as a museum, it has always been a disaster. Ever since it opened, the New National Gallery has been dogged by cracking windows, heavy condensation and awkward display spaces, presenting a curatorial nightmare for its staff.

The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon as a result of McCurry‚Äôs picture and social media. Harambe‚Äôs image was everywhere. Despite his photo being shared billions of times, however, McCurry did not gain much financially.

          "description": "Thanks to the arrival of Nigel Farage at GB News, the veteran newsman now finds himself among the mops and Domestos\nA woman I went on a blind date with in 1988 told me that witches she knew would consort with the devil at midnight, on the meadow by the river outside the town where I was a student. Soon after I decided to become a standup comedian, I sought them out, in the shadow of a ruined abbey, where the cursed remains of Henry II‚Äôs mistress Rosamund were destroyed in the dissolution. A bearded middle-aged man in a black polo neck and a pentangle pendant, a cliched look he nonetheless owned convincingly, stated terms on which I could be guaranteed to succeed beyond my wildest dreams. And, like a bloody fool, I accepted them. As promised, in 2018 the Times newspaper declared me the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs greatest living standup‚Äù. But I know the cost of that accolade. Deals with the devil have a habit of turning sour.\nIn 1930, at the age of 19, the travelling troubadour Robert Johnson stood at midnight, lit by the moon, at the crossroads of Highways 49 and 61, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and sold his soul to Papa Legba in exchange for unprecedented blues power. On 13 June 2021, at the age of 94 and a half, the respected veteran newsman Andrew Neil stood in a studio in Paddington Basin, lit by some battery-operated torches bought from an all-night garage in the Harrow Road, and sold his soul, and his reputation, to GB News chief executive Roberto Rastapopoulos‚Ñ¢¬Æ. What did Andrew Neil want in exchange for his precious essence? Money? Power? Some hair? And what did Andrew Neil get? Public humiliation, the loss of his hard-won reputation, the chance to play second fiddle to Nigel Farage and a tasty feast of hard cheddar, humble pie and human excrement. And no hair.\n Continue reading...",

At the foot of a staircase, I stepped aside to let a group of patients pass. Another staff member joined me, and we waited as the men, mainly in their 40s and 50s, descended in silence, walking carefully, hands skimming or leaning on the bannister for support. One man caught my attention because he looked like a stock image of Father Christmas, with a big white beard. When they‚Äôd gone, my companion turned to me. ‚ÄúDo you know who that was?‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúPeter Sutcliffe‚Ä¶ you know, the Yorkshire Ripper.‚Äù\nI remember thinking, with an intake of breath, ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs him.‚Äù He was one of the hospital‚Äôs most notorious patients, that rarest of offenders, a serial killer.

When detectives in Yorkshire were desperately trying to solve a series of brutal murders of local women, they interviewed Mr Sutcliffe seven times before he was identified as the suspect.

          "description": "Power from fusion has proved too hard to generate at scale. Can recent breakthroughs and massive investment change that?\nOn 8 August 2021, a laser-initiated experiment at the United States National Ignition Facility (NIF), based at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, made a significant breakthrough in reproducing the power source of the stars, smashing its own 2018 record for energy released from nuclear fusion reactions 23 times over. This advance saw 70% of the laser energy put in released as nuclear energy. A pulse of light, focused to tiny spots within a 10-metre diameter vacuum chamber, triggered the collapse of a capsule of fuel from roughly the size of the pupil in your eye to the diameter of a human hair. This implosion created the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure needed for atoms of hydrogen to combine into new atoms and release, kilogram for kilogram, 10m times the energy that would result from burning coal.\nThe result is tantalisingly close to a demonstration of ‚Äúnet energy gain‚Äù, the long sought-after goal of fusion scientists in which an amount greater than 100% of the energy put into a fusion experiment comes out as nuclear energy. The aim of these experiments is ‚Äì for now ‚Äì to show proof of principle only: that energy can be generated. The team behind the success are very close to achieving this: they have managed a more than 1,000-fold improvement in energy release between 2011 and today. Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said last month that ‚ÄúThe pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kickstart the process.‚Äù\n Continue reading...",

Even before the Bafta, Wood was always being stopped in the street. Fans wanted to talk to her, about Sex Education, about everything, because they related to her so strongly. Wood is naturally so friendly, she‚Äôd engage in conversation and make herself late. Then she starred opposite Bill Nighy in the forthcoming Oliver Hermanus film, Living: ‚ÄúObviously, every single person recognises Bill Nighy, and he handles it with such grace,‚Äù Wood says, when we meet to talk in a north London photo studio. ‚ÄúWith people in the street, I was like [she mock hyperventilates]: ‚ÄòDid I say the right thing?

She comes from a working-class family in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and although, following her parents‚Äô divorce, her mother‚Äôs new partner paid for her to attend a private secondary school, she kept her rich Mancunian tones: ‚ÄúI sound like my mum and I like that.

But I found everything I needed is there in what we eat\nMy father was not a big eater. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy if I could just take a pill for my lunch,‚Äù he once told me, when I was eight or nine years old. I had already concluded that the adult world could be wilfully baffling, but this seemed unnecessarily provocative. It felt like a betrayal. As a child, an unfocused mess of fat-softened limbs and round edges, I knew that food was great. I loved bacon sandwiches on white bread and chocolate √©clairs, and lived for evenings when my parents were short on time and dinner was the convenience of Findus Crispy Pancakes filled with delicious, if unidentifiable, brown matter.\nHappily, my mother was not interested in getting her nutrition from a pill. Claire wanted both to feed and be fed. On Saturday lunchtimes, after they had done the weekly shop, my mother would fill the kitchen table with cold cuts and cheeses, and plates laid with slippery ribbons of smoked salmon in the brightest shade of orange. There would be dense fish balls, chopped liver topped with crumbled egg and bagels, for we were Jews through food. There was no space in our lives for God, but there was lots of space for lunch. It was a meal called ‚ÄúFick and Porridge‚Äù, an adapted Spoonerism of pick and forage. It was one of those family jokes which isn‚Äôt funny to anybody else or even, eventually, to the family who coined it, but which sticks. What mattered was the intent expressed in the name: this was a knowingly relaxed lunch. It was also a form of open house to which certain close family friends knew they were always invited. And so they would come.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Assembly Festival Garden, Coventry\nOlivia Miller dazzles in this tart and punky solo show, which reimagines the Tudor monarch as an in-yer-face Gen-Z teen\nYou might consider the fraught life of Mary Tudor, England‚Äôs first queen, for a long time before thinking: standup comedy. But that‚Äôs the leap Olivia Miller has made with this punky solo, first performed in her home town of New York. It reimagines Mary as an in-yer-face Gen-Z teen, back from the dead to reprise her lurid life story, defend her name and justify that small matter of 280 heretics burned alive.\nShe makes a good fist of it. In fishnets and bovver boots, Miller shows off her standup chops, if not always in the quality of the jokes then in the dazzle and charm with which she brings her crowd on side. The repeated technique is to mine inappropriate intimacies (‚Äúraise your hand if you‚Äôve imagined your parents having sex?‚Äù), then demonstrate how our experiences can‚Äôt touch hers. Her parents‚Äô sex life is a matter of national debate, while Mary is put on the marriage market from two years old. Her mum is then exiled, never to be seen again, while dad upends a kingdom, affronts God and murders multiple wives, all to right the wrong of Mary‚Äôs unsatisfactory gender.\n Continue reading...",

London‚Äôs Royal Albert Hall may have been quieter than usual, but it has still welcomed audience members who are double-vaccinated, or have tested negative, by the thousands into its expansive auditorium. In the meantime, millions have listened to the broadcasts on BBC Radio 3, or watched the concerts on iPlayer or on television.\nBeneath the smooth surface, there have been many last-minute programme changes and artist swaps, as conductors and soloists booked to travel from overseas have encountered obstacles. On a number of occasions, UK-based artists have stepped in to fill the breach. In fact, the whole season, if one were so minded, might be seen as a tribute to the excellence of British orchestras, which ‚Äì with the exception of the Berlin-headquartered Mahler Chamber Orchestra ‚Äì have been the mainstay of this year‚Äôs season. That not only goes for the BBC orchestras, which always provide the concerts‚Äô backbone, but also smaller, younger ensembles, such as Chineke! and the Manchester Collective.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The glossy optimism of the location is a sleight of hand. Old Glasgow has been left to decay\nSailing up the Clyde was once how most travellers from abroad reached Glasgow, as well as those from Ireland, the Hebrides and the peninsulas of Argyll. Passenger liners came right up the river to within a mile of the city centre from New York and Boston and imperial cities where Scottish influence was particularly marked: Calcutta, Rangoon, Halifax, Montreal. As late as the 1960s, a traveller could step ashore in Glasgow having embarked in Dublin, Belfast or Bombay, though by that time the bigger transatlantic ships were ferrying their passengers ashore in the deeper water off Greenock, 25 miles downstream.\nThis trade contracted slowly in the last 50 years of the last century, and then suddenly it vanished. Other port cities have been similarly deserted, but perhaps in none of them, even New York, did the loss feel so confounding. Glasgow, after all, had seen a steamship long before it saw a steam locomotive; the first commercially successful steamboat in Europe began operating on the Clyde in 1812, beaten only to a global first (so Glasgow patriots reckoned) by the sharp practice of an American who had stolen the idea and put it to work on the Hudson. Today, the last vessel to perpetuate this two-centuries-old tradition is the elegant paddle steamer Waverley, built in 1947, which sails to and from Glasgow for two or three months every summer and whose near-miraculous survival is a testament to the love that Britain affords old machines.\n Continue reading...",

That‚Äôs about when our four-legged Welsh friend moved in and the first thing he did was to water the rhubarb. And, from that moment on, we called him Roobarb.‚Äù\nCalveley started drawing sketches of a dog‚Äôs adventures and kept knocking on the door of the BBC, imploring it to take up his idea, which also featured a cat called Custard, based on his neighbours‚Äô pet. The pre-school children‚Äôs show Play School considered his stories too short for its 15-minute slot, but Calveley was persistent and finally able to sell his idea when the Australian-born director Bob Godfrey ‚Äì who had already made a cartoon series featuring the Beatles and mock-erotic short films such as Kama Sutra Rides Again ‚Äì suggested producing a 30-second black-and-white sample.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The party is set to become a partner to the SNP. Yet even though climate concerns are growing, it faces a raft of new challenges\nGreen politics in Britain has always had a problem with scale. The disparity between the damage being done to the planet and the forces mobilised against it, in electoral politics and on the streets, has so far been painfully stark.\nThe first British Green party (originally called the People party) was founded in the early 1970s, when anxiety about the environment was almost as widespread as it is now. Its initial election manifesto was based on A Blueprint for Survival ‚Äì a bestselling book that warned of ‚Äúthe breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet‚Äù if the economic status quo continued. Yet it took another 37 years, until 2010, for Britain to elect its first Green MP, Caroline Lucas. The representative for Brighton Pavilion still remains the only Green in the Commons.\nOur electoral system‚Äôs hostility to new parties has obviously held the\nGreens back. But so has the tendency of environmental emergencies to leave voters feeling overwhelmed and paralysed, or in denial. Meanwhile in protest politics, even the clarity and ingenuity of groups such as Extinction Rebellion often seem to have only a fleeting impact. When its city-centre roadblocks have been cleared away, the usual traffic and consumerism return, almost as if nothing has happened. Green politics, somehow both too big and too small to gain sustained mainstream attention, seems stuck in its niche.\nBut there are signs that this may finally be changing. Last week the Scottish Greens announced a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish National party. If it is accepted at a members‚Äô meeting on Saturday, the Scottish Greens will become the first British Green party to enter government.\n Continue reading...",

In America‚Äôs midwest, Capote‚Äôs help is solicited by a small-town sheriff stumped by a string of diabolically ingenious murders in his remote farming community. The victims have been killed in ways suggesting intimate knowledge of their habits, yet nowhere is there any apparent motive. In the end Capote has no evidence but meets up with the man he reasons must be the killer. He‚Äôs fly-fishing. Waist-high in a stream, he talks about the ‚Äúwill of God‚Äù. As little as I then knew about the sport, it somehow made perfect sense that the killer would be fly-fishing.\nIn a larger sense, fly-fishing is a discipline of the mind, about things unseen. In the run-up to my trip to Sweden‚Äôs fly-fishing mecca √Ñlvdalen, four hours north of Stockholm, I listened to fly-fishing stories on the internet. Many are about technique, or about making the ‚Äúflies,‚Äù the tiny lures fly-fishers use; also, oddly, there are a great many tales about fly-fishing as a sort of personal, even spiritual, quest, about people who go to restore a relationship, to help them unravel some knotty issue in their lives or just find peace of mind.

But its relationship to our current reality feels tenuous.\nNot that there‚Äôs any gainsaying Feffer‚Äôs expertise: by day, he‚Äôs a foreign policy expert at Washington DC‚Äôs Institute for Policy Studies. In a performance recorded at Baltimore Theatre Project earlier this year, he plays both our guileless hero Christopher and the wisecracking Groucho Marx-alike President Gumball; other characters are projected (video design by Kelly Colburn and Dylan Uremovich) on to a stacked-boxes set. We watch as social misfit Christopher is cast out by his uncomprehending parents, co-opted at university by a revolutionary cadre of humour-phobes, then caught up in a cold war between the US and the so-called Federation, a USSR-alike where jokes are strictly samizdat.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Richer countries must wake up and see the bigger Covid picture\nThe statistics are stark and shaming. During an exasperated intervention earlier this week, the World Health Organization‚Äôs director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that of 4.8bn Covid vaccine doses delivered around the world to date, around 75% have gone to just 10 countries. The level of vaccine donations from richer countries, he added with some understatement, has been ‚Äúreally disappointing‚Äù. In Africa, where a third wave of the virus has been on the march since May, less than 2% of the continent‚Äôs population has received a first dose. While high-income countries across the globe have administered around 100 doses for every 100 citizens, the equivalent figure for low-income countries is 1.5.\nAs a consequence, while the United States, Britain and other richer nations begin to roll out programmes for booster shots in the autumn, a pandemic of the unvaccinated continues unabated elsewhere. The WHO‚Äôs target of reaching 10% of the population of every country with a first shot by the end of September is unlikely to be met. This grotesque inequity, as Mr Ghebreyesus and others have repeatedly pointed out, is ultimately in no one‚Äôs interest. Allowing much of the planet to operate as a variant factory, and the more transmissible Delta variant to run riot, stores up trouble for the future. ‚ÄúVaccinating the world‚Äù should therefore be seen as sound strategy as well as an ethical obligation. But, in Europe and North America, early good intentions have so far come a distant second to domestic priorities.\n Continue reading...",

When she and her husband, the artist John Houston, visited New York in 1969 on the way to paint the Wyoming landscape, they made trips to the Museum of Modern Art to see Picasso and Matisse, not Pollock and Warhol. Modern art institutions returned the compliment: there are only half a dozen or so Blackadders in the Tate, all but one of them lithographs, few ever on show and none more recent than 1963.

Without any cuts to darkness or a camera flash, Barantini follows the dizzying continuous action in the kitchens and out in the dining room as the pressure begins to take its toll on everyone.

One of those shows was actually called Ramsay‚Äôs Boiling Point.\nAndy is seen showing up ominously late for work one evening, talking on his mobile, trying to juggle some tricky situation in his disintegrating domestic life. Already, his highly professional support staff are dismayed at his behaviour and how they will be expected to cover up for him, even as he takes it out on members of the team junior to them. His trusted seniors are Carly (Vinette Robinson) and commis chef Freeman (Ray Panthaki). Meanwhile, the front-of-house maitre d‚Äô Beth (Alice Feetham) is far too ready to accommodate off-menu requests from annoying food influencers with big Instagram followings. There are many other plot-flavours in this seething stew, but the biggest nightmare is that Andy‚Äôs former boss, telly celebrity chef Alastair Skye (a fantastically unctuous Jason Flemyng) has chosen tonight of all nights to show up, bringing with him sleek food critic Sara Southworth (Lourdes Faberes); for all Alastair‚Äôs fame he is none too pleased at how well his former protege appears to be doing.

Britain, France and Germany asked Joe Biden to continue evacuating civilians from Kabul past his self-imposed deadline of 31 August. But the US rejected these requests. Mr Biden wanted to end the chaotic TV scenes from Afghanistan that hurt his domestic poll ratings. But he also accepted that Kabul‚Äôs new rulers could not afford to look weak in front of their rival Isis, which is looking for an opportunity to embarrass its Taliban peer.\nThe west‚Äôs airlift will therefore be over by next Tuesday. It is the Afghan people who will pay the highest price for the west‚Äôs defeated ambitions for their country. They now face living under Taliban rule for a second time. There is no guarantee that a grinding civil war is over. The scale of the west‚Äôs failure is not just that the world‚Äôs biggest economies will almost certainly fail to evacuate all those who were employed by its armies and diplomats. It is that we have let down a generation of urban Afghans, especially women, who grew up believing that their lives would be better than their parents‚Äô.\n Continue reading...",

On Tuesday, Mr Zelenskiy presided over a military parade in Kiev, attended by an impressive array of dignitaries and heads of state. But in a week when he hoped to concentrate the minds of western allies on Russian bullying and intransigence, their focus is firmly on Afghanistan.\nThe struggle to stay on the diplomatic radar has become a familiar one. On Monday, Ukraine held an attention-seeking summit on Crimea, illegally annexed by Vladimir Putin in March 2014. The European Union, with which Ukraine signed an association agreement months later, imposed sanctions, and refuses to recognise the territory as part of Russia. At the summit, the European council president, Charles Michel, promised that the EU would continue to ‚Äústand tall‚Äù against such violations of international law. But in truth, the Russian annexation is a fait accompli that no one now expects to be reversed. Sending late apologies, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel failed to appear at the event.\n Continue reading...",

Spending several hours a day ranting about politics on the internet hasn‚Äôt just earned him more than a million followers, it‚Äôs also made him a lot of money: Piker has just bought a $2.7m (¬£1.9m) house with a swimming pool in West Hollywood. Cue screams of ‚Äúclass traitor‚Äù and ‚Äúhypocrite!‚Äù\nPiker‚Äôs new pad has drawn a lot of criticism from fans who think he has betrayed his socialist values. It has also drawn predictable ire from the rightwing media, who have used the story to try to prove socialists don‚Äôt have any values. There is nothing conservatives love more than an opportunity to write a story along the lines of ‚ÄúFRAUD: self-proclaimed socialist buys something!‚Äù They seem to think that you can‚Äôt possibly critique capitalism if you own any sort of property. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example has been criticised by rightwing commentators for owning a nice jacket and a Tesla; Bernie Sanders has been slammed for owning three houses; Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter and self-described Marxist, has been dubbed a hypocrite for buying multiple houses.\n Continue reading...",

But after they had been ousted by international forces, the group rapidly expanded its online presence, starting in 2003 with a new insurgency. They launched a new radio station called Voice of Sharia, which had its own website, Al Emarah. Despite numerous attempts to block and remove it, Al Emarah has remained the official website of the Taliban. The site primarily contains battlefield news and videos, as well as the Taliban‚Äôs official statements.

As a result of Joe Biden‚Äôs precipitate haste to get the withdrawal over and done with, and the negligent response of allies such as Britain, a humanitarian crisis is already in train.

          "description": "The liberalisation of betting has had some damaging effects and the industry should stop denying it\nNew Labour liberalised gambling in Britain with the 2005 Gambling Act, which introduced one of the most permissive regulatory frameworks in the world. The idea was that more betting would deliver economic benefits, and in one sense it did. The gross take from gambling has nearly doubled, with punters losing ¬£10.2bn a year. The industry‚Äôs marketing spend has boomed. And HM Revenue and Customs has gained too: Denise Coates, who runs the Stoke-based gambling giant Bet365, paid ¬£573m in taxes in 2019-20 ‚Äì over ¬£100m more than anyone else.\nBut along with the increase in gambling came rises in the harms associated with it. When the legislation was passed, concerns were focused on supercasinos. But what happened, instead of the creation of giant hubs, is that gambling (like so much else) moved online and to smartphones, where in-play betting during the course of a football match or other event became one of the most popular ways to bet. The other big change was the spread of fixed-odds betting terminals, from which gambling companies earned huge amounts: ¬£1.8bn in profits each year until the maximum stake was slashed from ¬£100 to ¬£2 in 2020, following a public outcry and the high-profile resignation of a Conservative minister, Tracey Crouch.\n Continue reading...",

What is driving its popularity?\nThis week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from the year so far. This episode was first broadcast on 2 March.\nRachel Humphreys talks to Guardian writer Sophie Elmhirst about the increasing popularity of the Brazilian butt lift (BBL), which is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery in the world. Since 2015, the number of butt lifts performed globally has grown by 77.6%, according to a recent survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The BBL began in Brazil, birthplace of aesthetic surgery and the myth of the naturally ‚Äústicky-outy‚Äù bottom, the kind seen in countless tourist board images of bikini-clad women on Copacabana beach. As part of her research, Sophie spent time with the British aesthetic surgeon Dr Lucy Glancey and her patient Melissa*, who was planning to have her second BBL. Sophie tells Rachel why she thinks more and more women are demanding the procedure despite the risks ‚Äì the BBL has been called the world‚Äôs most dangerous procedure.\n Continue reading...",

It is now set for its highest number of gun killings in 20 years\nAs Covid cases surge once more in the US, another public health crisis is pummelling the country too. Last year, gun killings soared by around 4,000, to almost 20,000 in total ‚Äì the worst single-year increase on record. So far, 2021 looks even worse. In the first five months alone, more than 8,100 people died. America is set for the deadliest toll in nearly two decades.\nAlarmingly, there is also a surge in gun purchases. The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. But last year saw a 64% jump compared with the previous year, to an estimated 20m guns. Around a fifth of buyers were first-time owners. The pandemic sparked a rush to purchase firearms, and some bought because so many others were doing so. The backlash against Black Lives Matter protests may have played a part. Black Americans saw the highest increase in gun ownership and, reportedly, Asian Americans also bought more guns, as hate crimes have risen. Sales have continued to grow this year, with manufacturers struggling to produce enough ammunition.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "An acute shortage of staff offers an incentive to improve a stressful working culture\nWhite Heat, by Marco Pierre White, is one of the most influential recipe books of the past 30 years. Published in 1990, its edgy black and white photography popularised an idea of the chef-as-hero, immersed in the creative Sturm und Drang of a frantically busy restaurant kitchen. Its cover features a handsome 28-year-old Mr White in a butcher‚Äôs apron, looking moody and a little like Jim Morrison.\nFor most chefs the reality has always been much less romantic. Long, unsociable hours are often poorly rewarded, and a sometimes brutal workload makes cheffing one of the most stressful ways to earn a living. Burnout is commonplace, and a healthy work-life balance difficult to maintain. One 2019 survey found that eight out of 10 employees in professional kitchens had experienced mental health problems during their career. Research by the Unite union discovered that 52% of chefs have a negative view of their jobs and only 22% would recommend the life to school-leavers. Happily, there are some tentative early signs that the hospitality hiatus caused by Covid may lead to change for the better.\n Continue reading...",

For each of the three weeks, five plays are performed by 10 actors at each performance.\nWith each play at little over 10 minutes in length, it allows for swift and playful variations in dramatic tone and formal experimentation.

These props are chosen by the audience at the beginning of each performance, as well as a costume, unknown to the performers. We are also invited to intervene in the casting of roles.

Others, explaining that Brexit was about stopping refugees and immigration, want everyone there to be left to die, as sorting out the mess we have made is apparently not our business. Admittedly, I have the same attitude to the toilet bowl after an ill-advised lamb phaal, but I am just a 53-year-old ‚Äúso-called‚Äù comedian, not an elected leader of the free world with blood on his hands.\nOn Wednesday, I drove distractedly across England listening to a baffling prime minister‚Äôs questions. Various politicians, trying to read the fickle electorate‚Äôs current position on the hate/compassion mood board, swinging again like it did after the death of little Alan Kurdi, explained how welcoming Britain has always been to refugees. I stopped to eat an artisanal steak pie at the Rollright Stones and wondered how our legendarily welcoming nature squared with the government‚Äôs new nationality and borders bill, which aims to criminalise anyone who attempts to seek asylum and anyone who attempts to help anyone seeking asylum. Even lifeboat men and women risking their lives to dredge dying children from the Channel could be criminals it seems, the horrible bastards. A fake Home Office website called Migrants on the Move, like the fake Conservative Campaign HQ factcheckUK site Dominic Raab defended during the last election, even purports to offer objective but deliberately discouraging advice to would-be Britons. Who even knew that the UK was full of venomous hamsters and that, in Kent, human hair is illegal?\n Continue reading...",

As the chief of Stanford University‚Äôs dual diagnosis addiction clinic (which caters to people with more than one disorder), Lembke has spent the past 25-plus years treating patients addicted to everything from heroin, gambling and sex to video games, Botox and ice baths.

          "description": "The professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience discusses his work to develop a scientific explanation for how the brain conjures consciousness\nFor centuries, philosophers have theorised about the mind-body question, debating the relationship between the physical matter of the brain and the conscious mental activity it somehow creates. Even with advances in neuroscience and brain imaging techniques, large parts of that fundamental relationship remain stubbornly mysterious. It was with good reason that, in 1995, the cognitive scientist David Chalmers coined the term ‚Äúthe hard problem‚Äù to describe the question of exactly how our brains conjure subjective conscious experience. Some philosophers continue to insist that mind is inherently distinct from matter. Advances in understanding how the brain functions undermine those ideas of dualism, however.\nAnil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, is at the leading edge of that latter research. His Ted talk on consciousness has been viewed more than 11m times. His new book, Being You, proposes an idea of the human mind as a ‚Äúhighly evolved prediction machine‚Äù, rooted in the functions of the body and ‚Äúconstantly hallucinating the world and the self‚Äù to create reality. \n Continue reading...",

Maybe the practice strikes them as shifty or weirdly old-fashioned.

What exactly have I got to tell this black book about a life that we share all day, every day? What secrets can I possibly be keeping?\nThe answer: nothing of any great note, and yet so much of my life is in it. I started writing a journal (as I used to call it) when I went on holiday. Twenty years ago I decided to go full-time and since then I‚Äôve kept it more or less every day. Why? I suppose it began as an experiment ‚Äì and became an obligation. You can‚Äôt hold back time, but you can try to save the past from being completely erased. It often feels trivial to record things as they happen (a stray remark, hearing a song, fleeting moments of doom or delight), but later they may prove useful, or instructive, or amusing. It also maintains the illusion of diligence ‚Äì that you‚Äôre not just pissing away the days. A diary is good exercise for the writing muscle, the way a pianist practises scales or a footballer does keepy-uppies.

So what we have here is a package of four CDs and a book tracing Barber‚Äôs career as one track follows another.

The results were sometimes quite spectacular.\nThe eighth of these 69 tracks, from 1956, has the band‚Äôs banjo player, Lonnie Donegan, singing Rock Island Line with bass and washboard accompaniment. It sparked a nationwide craze for amateur skiffle groups, without which there would have been no Beatles. Unlike other trad bands, Barber‚Äôs never got stuck in a rut. Every record, every tour was a fresh start. As the tracks roll on we hear blues, gospel, ragtime and guest stars such as Louis Jordan, Joe Harriott, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Dr John, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.

          "description": "With Afghan citizens‚Äô data now in the hands of the Taliban, assumptions about controls that check misuse of intelligence are wide of the mark\nIn the summer of 2013, shortly after Edward Snowden‚Äôs revelations about the surveillance capabilities of the American National Security Agency (NSA) began to appear, I had a private conversation with a former cabinet minister about the implications of the leaks. At one stage, I mentioned to him a remark attributed to a prime architect of some of the NSA systems ‚Äì that they had taken the US to ‚Äúa keystroke away from totalitarianism‚Äù. The MP scoffed at the idea. What I needed to remember, he told me, in that superior tone that toffs adopt when speaking to their gardeners, was that the US and the UK were ‚Äúmature democracies‚Äù. In such polities, the chances of anyone coming to power who might have the inclination to use such power for sinister purposes was, he said, zero.\nThree years later, the US elected Donald Trump. Five years after Trump, look around: an increasing number of democracies are now run by autocrats of various stripes. Think of Orb√°n in Hungary, the Law and Justice party in Poland, Duterte in the Philippines, Erdoƒüan in Turkey, Modi in India, Bolsonaro in Brazil and others in Latin America. None of these autocrats has any scruples about using intelligence collected by state agencies against critics, dissidents and potential opponents. In fact, they positively relish being just a keystroke away from totalitarian control.\n Continue reading...",

I went for a walk to my local woods. I loved the warm hug of the sun, the smell of refreshing rain-dampened grass and the soothing melodies of the birds. In that moment I was at peace, filled with a feeling of pure happiness and calm. Then I stumbled across a tree in the open field. It made me stop and think. I felt joy and sadness, because half of it was full of life and half was lifeless.\nI stared and marvelled at how the tree could balance both life and death, yet still look so beautiful and serene. This made me realise how life and death coexist and that I had a choice to make on how I perceived this scene before me. Taking a deep breath, I looked at the tree again. This time I saw beauty throughout. On one side, the luscious leaves protected a bird‚Äôs nest. But also, the dead branches were serving as a perch for birds, and the hollow trunk was a shelter for small animals and a multitude of insects such as beetles. I saw positivity.

With closure forced on them by the pandemic, they were unable to earn money from ticket sales, shops or cafes; when they reopened for a time last summer, and again this spring, they had to cope with reduced footfall and the costs of expensive interventions to render them Covid-safe. Some of their funders, especially local authorities, have suffered gravely too, with cuts at times passed on.\nThe Museums Prize, run by the charity Art Fund, has a distinguished history of rewarding excellence in British institutions. Often in the past the focus has been on multimillion-pound, attention-grabbing capital projects. The past two years, though, have seen a shift in the focus of the prize ‚Äì one that may portend a wider change of emphasis in how cultural value is estimated. In 2020, the prize, which was already in process when the pandemic hit, was split between the shortlisted candidates, the prize money having been doubled to ¬£200,000. This year, entrants were asked three simple questions: what did you do that showed imagination and determination? How do you think this made a difference? How will you build on this in the future?\n Continue reading...",

There are also a host of smaller age-limited grants, residencies and other opportunities, not to mention publicity campaigns similar to Futures, such a Granta‚Äôs Best Young British Novelists (for under-40s) and their Best Young Spanish Novelists (who, for some reason, have to make it even faster, by the age of 35).

However, the law as it stands means legal cases challenging menopause-related discrimination need to be brought on grounds of sex, age or disability.\nIf the law currently works inadequately, should menopause be added to the list of grounds recognised by the Equality Act 2010 (Equality laws could be changed to protect women in menopause, says MP, 18 August)? In our view, menopause-based discrimination highlights instead the relevance and value of an ‚Äúintersectional‚Äù approach. This recognises that discrimination is often due to a combination of social biases.

Later, on 3 March, he described how safe it was to shake hands with Covid patients and said that he would go on doing so.

A lucky selection of editors, writers and influencers flaunted their copies; others bemoaned not having been granted one. Soon listings for proof copies (which are clearly marked ‚Äúnot for resale‚Äù) started to appear on trading sites such as eBay and Depop. One copy, listed on eBay by a seller in North Carolina, sold in June for $209.16. Even the canvas tote bag that Rooney‚Äôs publicists had been sending out with the ARC copies was fetching prices in the region of $80. And this growing market for unpublished novels is not just a product of Rooney-mania: Jonathan Franzen‚Äôs Crossroads, which will be published in October,  sold earlier this month on eBay for $124.\nAdvance copies of popular and classic novels have long been collector‚Äôs items. A rare proof copy of JK Rowling‚Äôs Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, for example, or classics by authors such as Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck can sell for up to ¬£30,000. But this high demand for ARCs of books that are yet to be published has only emerged recently, fuelled in part by the rise of book bloggers and influencers.\n Continue reading...",

There has been a fierce row over attempts to introduce a disciplinary system to keep judges in line. A controversial new bill threatens to further compromise media independence, by banning non-European ownership of broadcasting companies. Both the European Union and the United States have railed at these latest anti-democratic manoeuvres, designed to strengthen the authoritarian grip of the Law and Justice party (PiS). But, despite all the international criticism, PiS remains ahead of its rivals in the polls.\nSo far, so familiar. But six years after PiS won power, turning Poland into a bastion of European illiberalism alongside Hungary, the party‚Äôs polarising playbook is not working the political magic it once did. This week Warsaw backed down on the judges dispute, which was in danger of becoming a tipping point in its vexed relations with the EU. Under pressure from Brussels, it has disbanded the supreme court chamber ‚Äì packed with political appointees ‚Äì to which court verdicts would have been answerable. Having gone to the brink, Poland blinked first.\n Continue reading...",

Really? From 2003 until 2010, when he was chief executive of Royal Mail (which then owned the Post Office), he oversaw the hounding of subpostmasters who were accused of theft and fraud because of the seriously flawed Fujitsu Horizon IT system that they were obliged to use. Under his watch, people were bankrupted and ostracised as prosecutions were pursued against them.\nThis scandal has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in English legal history (UK government sets aside up to ¬£233m to cover Post Office payouts, 25 July). Only in the past year or so has there been any correction of the shocking wrong done to those subpostmasters. Nobody in charge at the Post Office or Fujitsu has ever been brought to book. And as for compensation, will it be the Post Office or Fujitsu or any of those who were in charge paying? No. It will be the taxpayer. So, Adam Crozier did not steer the Post Office out of any corporate crisis. He steered it headlong into one.\nMike Lucraft \nSaltdean, East Sussex\n Continue reading...",

It follows the title character (played by Bassant Ahmed) and Rabab (Basmala Elghaiesh), sisters of 19 and 13 living in Zagazig, a small city 40 miles north of Cairo in the Nile delta. To her family and friends, Souad is as religious as she is studious ‚Äì but she lives a different life online. She has virtual relationships with men and becomes enthralled by the glamorous-seeming Ahmed (Hussein Ghanem), an influencer from the fashionable Mediterranean city of Alexandria.

I prefer to ‚Äòsit back and relax‚Äô and my partner is OK with that. If I get on top or have too much control, I am unable to get out of my head and I feel stressed. However, my personality and moral side finds this conflicting, as outside the bedroom I am a feminist and agree that women have for too long been taught to submit to their man and forget their own needs. This has caused confusion in my understanding of the way I enjoy sex. How can I feel as if I am in control without being dominant in the bedroom? Can I be a feminist while being submissive during sex?\nConsensual sex requires that both partners give permission for what occurs, whether they take on a more passive or a dominant role at any given moment. If someone chooses to assume a submissive erotic position, that is an agreement that he or she could withdraw at any time. So, in fact, the submissive partner is actually the moral controller; if that person wishes to gain physical dominance, he or she must first be sure that permission for that is fully granted by the partner. But while these facts may help you to consider physical submission more ethically palatable, in general, erotic connections are heightened when taboos are broken ‚Ä¶ including what might be considered a feminist no-no.\n Continue reading...",

Lord Lloyd-Webber‚Äôs richly enjoyable orchestrations range from grand waltzes, courtly processionals and marches to deftly pastiched and deeply felt romanticism, power-balladry, a splash of chanson and rollicking guitar riffs.

Two sets of friends are allowed to redecorate a room in the other‚Äôs house with the help of designers such as the aforementioned Barker, Ryder Richardson and ‚Äì above all ‚Äì Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, along with ‚ÄúHandy Andy‚Äù, who led the carpenters, painters etc who did the actual work required to transfer the pure stupidity in their heads into three-dimensional stupidity that could be spray-painted and used to sit/sleep/cry on.\n Continue reading...",

Londoners are confronted with plans for a giant burning-red orb, which will supposedly serve as a concert venue, and it brings on the shudders.\nNew buildings can amuse or repulse us, induce awe or yawns, but there is a case for thinking of them less as objects to walk around and more as processes to worry about ‚Äì because the process of building is one of the most wasteful and carbon-hungry engaged in by humanity. We tear down old houses or shops, and to create new ones, we cover the Earth with materials that have gobbled up fossil fuels: Concrete, of which the world pours enough each year to patio over every park and mountain and back garden, every square inch, in England; steel, of which every tonne produced emits nearly two tonnes of carbon dioxide; plastics. While Conservative MPs argue over who is going to foot the bill for green energy for our homes, hardly anyone in Westminster discusses the upfront carbon costs of building houses and office blocks and shopping malls. Yet construction directly accounts for about 10% of our carbon emissions. Turning approximately 50,000 buildings to rubble every year creates two-thirds of all the waste produced in this country. If the UK is ever to translate its net zero ambitions into reality it will need to change the entire building industry.\n Continue reading...",

This development is welcome news for Spears and her supporters, dubbed the #FreeBritney movement. But it will not end Spears‚Äô conservatorship, which has prevented her from making decisions about her own life since it was established shortly after she had a mental breakdown in 2008. Nor will it prevent others from finding themselves in similar situations. That will require changing the underlying legal systems that created Spears‚Äô predicament.\nWhile many have only recently learned of conservatorship thanks to the #FreeBritney movement, this legal process is neither new nor unique to the US. It is a common court proceeding in which the court appoints someone to make decisions for individuals the court has found cannot make decisions for themselves. California ‚Äì where Spears lives ‚Äì calls this proceeding conservatorship and calls the appointee a conservator. More commonly, it is called guardianship and the appointee is called a guardian. While Spears has drawn attention to guardianship, the process typically entangles those far less privileged.

Pale Yorkshire sunshine streams in through the windows. We‚Äôre out in the garden in Castleford, at the home of Rob‚Äôs parents, and there are times when it‚Äôs possible to almost forget the deadly impact of motor neurone disease. Rob won eight Grand Finals with Leeds Rhinos as they dominated rugby league from 2004 to 2017 and he played 20 times for Great Britain and England in a celebrated career. But this once cheerfully garrulous man is now a silent prisoner in his body as MND paralyses him and prevents him from talking.\nRob still smiles easily and breaks his silence when he laughs. His vocal cords are in the grip of MND so it is no ordinary laugh. Sometimes, his short bark of mirth makes it sound like he is crying or struggling for breath. But his eyes confirm he is laughing. The pain and the sorrow are hidden then in the shadows beyond the summerhouse.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The fall of Kabul to the Taliban should spark a more honest debate about the UK‚Äôs unconditional support for US plans\nThe UK‚Äôs latest Afghan war, the fourth since 1839, has ended in failure. There is no consolation in claiming that this shameful retreat was down to a bungled withdrawal of US forces by Joe Biden. Britain scuttled out at the same time, the prime minister telling MPs on the day of Mr Biden‚Äôs announcement that ‚Äúthere is no military path to victory for the Taliban‚Äù. As events subsequently proved, Boris Johnson‚Äôs assessment of the situation was badly wrong. The extent of the military and political catastrophe for the UK that the blitzkrieg Taliban takeover represents is hard to overstate.\nThe UK is currently driven by a desire to stay close to the US. But America is a superpower, able to shrug off defeats and move on. The blow of losing Kabul is felt more deeply in a Britain shorn of substantial global influence. This has led the UK to take Washington‚Äôs lead in military affairs. In Afghanistan, the US judgment that a combination of special forces, local proxies and air power would wipe out domestic resistance to a military occupation was flawed. The Afghan security forces that Nato trained were exposed as a shell. In 20 years, according to Brown University‚Äôs Costs of War project, more than 170,000 Afghans have lost their lives. The death toll was rising. In June almost 1,000 Afghans were killed in the simmering civil war. A few weeks later half the country was under Taliban control.\n Continue reading...",

In Europe, these cities are often places with long histories that morphed into industrial, commercial or trading hubs. Cities like Hamburg, Lyon and Turin can perhaps be seen in this way.\nIn Belgium, Antwerp is one of the most striking examples of this phenomenon of simultaneous fame and neglect. Antwerp is one of the great historic cities of Europe. In a highly readable new book, Michael Pye argues that, during Europe‚Äôs ages of discovery, it became one of the earliest genuinely global cities too. For much of the 16th century, it was what Paris, New York or London would become in later times, a place of restless wealth and vigour where, as Mr Pye puts it, anything could happen or at least anything could be believed.\n Continue reading...",

The small, supportive, mixed-sex community she created online is a world apart from the extremist, hate-fuelled ideology it has transformed into in the many years since she left those online spaces behind. ‚ÄúIt feels like being the scientist who figured out nuclear fission and then discovers it‚Äôs being used as a weapon for war,‚Äù she later told the Guardian.\nToday‚Äôs incels are not a clearly defined, organised group, but rather a sprawling, disparate community of men across a network of blogs, forums, websites, private members groups, chatrooms and social media channels. Several of the forums have memberships in the tens of thousands, with around a 25% increase in membership in the two years I have been researching them. And these figures don‚Äôt take into account the number of people visiting and being influenced by these sites without necessarily signing up.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Available online\nGetting drunk or looking for love, Florence Espeut-Nickless‚Äôs character commands the space, finding hope amid despair\n\nDestiny is preparing for a big Thursday night out in rural Wiltshire. She leads us to her local nightclub, Karma, where the drinks are 50p and the evening will ultimately go sour, setting her on a path of desperate longing for love.\nThough her existence is littered with misfortune ‚Äì including distant parenting, limited finances and sexual abuse ‚Äì she is full of hope. She has faith that things will get better. She dreams of showbiz and of being an MTV Base backing dancer. Her fantasies are long-lasting, her resilience inbuilt.\nIt is difficult not to warm to Destiny, written and performed by Florence Espeut-Nickless in a monologue directed by Jesse Jones, presented online for the Edinburgh fringe and supported by the Pleasance and by Bristol Old Vic‚Äôs Ferment programme. Despite her surface-level confidence, there is a naivety to her storytelling. As she repeatedly makes decisions that end in inevitable pain, she manages to find humour in her darkest moments ‚Äì and you can‚Äôt help but laugh along, even if it‚Äôs at her fantasies about a TV presenter while she is having sex with a man much older than her. \nThe spare set, designed by Joseff Harris, features quick-changing lights and a single chair: we‚Äôre almost completely reliant on Espeut-Nickless‚Äôs ability to command the room. This filmed version is performed to a live audience, and Destiny‚Äôs spirit is engaging early on. \nIf her story is one we‚Äôve probably heard before, it doesn‚Äôt make it any less authentic ‚Äì and it is captivatingly told in the West Country vernacular of Destiny‚Äôs community. With endearing personality, she does them proud.\nDestiny is available online and live at Bristol Tobacco Factory theatres, 7-8 September.\n Continue reading...",

On this sunny morning in LA, she appears relaxed, in a pink-striped shirt and trousers, reminiscent of the early 80s outfits she wore for her many appearances on Late Night With David Letterman.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "A look back at the official photographs of Obama‚Äôs presidency shows his skill at conjuring a sense of pride and possibility ‚Äì but today his victories seem narrow indeed\nFrom the beginning, Obama‚Äôs team was invested in constructing a certain image of what would be deemed a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù presidency. During Obama‚Äôs campaign, the artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the famous ‚ÄúHope‚Äù poster, was widely acknowledged as his key iconographer. But, in retrospect, who Obama was and what he represented endures in the public imagination thanks to the work of the White House photographer Pete Souza, a longtime photojournalist who first had the assignment under Ronald Reagan. Over time, Souza helped create a new image of race in the US. This was an image of a postracial nation, where postracial didn‚Äôt mean liberation ‚Äì it meant a US where race was solely affect and gesture, rather than the old brew of capital, land and premature death. Progress would deposit us in a place where black would be pure style ‚Äì a style that the ruling class could finally wear out.\nIn the thick of the 2008 primary, in an essay titled Native Son, George Packer argued that after a half century when ‚Äúrightwing populism has been the most successful political force in America‚Äù, there was finally hope for an alternative. ‚ÄúObama is a black candidate,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwho can tell Americans of all races to move beyond race.‚Äù The ensuing years bore out the impossibility of that widely held belief, but it was already evident in the language. How could a single person be black and capable of moving everybody beyond race?\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The departure of US forces was followed by a rout of Afghan government forces. Now, after 20 years of western intervention, Afghanistan is back under the control of the Taliban\nIt began with a steady trickle of military defeats. First Afghan government control was ceded to the Taliban in provincial towns and cities. Then, as the lack of resistance became apparent, bigger cities and regional capitals began to fall. Finally on Sunday the Taliban entered Kabul as the western-backed government fled the country. \nThe Guardian‚Äôs senior international correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, tells Michael Safi that it marks a stunning reversal for the Afghan government, which had begun negotiating a deal with the Taliban in recent months. And as deeply flawed as the government in Kabul has been for the past 20 years, it has created space for the education of girls and a free press. All of that is now in grave doubt as Afghans wait to see whether their new Taliban rulers plan to carry on where they left off in 2001. We hear voices from inside Afghanistan including reporter Zahra Joya, who was a child when US forces invaded in 2001 and drove out the Taliban. She describes her fears for what will come next.\n Continue reading...",

The panel warned of grave consequences if Joe Biden allowed himself to be driven by dates and a strict timeline, rather than a realistic assessment of conditions on the ground. Mr Biden, who had inherited a 1 May exit deadline from Donald Trump, ignored this advice, naming instead a new date. All US forces would be gone by 11 September, exactly two decades after the invasion prompted by the al-Qaida attack on the World Trade Center.\nA timetable bound up with domestic political symbolism has handed over Afghanistan to the Taliban and millions of Afghans to a frightening and unstable future. In the spring, a Biden administration official said: ‚ÄúWe went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked us on September 11th ‚Ä¶ We believe we achieved that objective some years ago.‚Äù These words were presumably intended to convey a pragmatic determination to end a ‚Äúforever war‚Äù, as well as a neat sense of narrative closure.

This is the mating season of some of the most common varieties, when male house spiders come out of hidden corners to look for females, and garden spiders reach adult size and spin their biggest, most dazzling webs.\nYet while the spider is familiar, the star of one of the great children‚Äôs books, Charlotte‚Äôs Web, and a fixture of nursery rhymes and Halloween decor, its relationship with humans is complicated. Fear of spiders, arachnophobia, is common and has serious impacts on the lives of sufferers. Its prevalence appears unrelated to any rational assessment of risk.

By the end, with Tottenham sticking to Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo‚Äôs plan after Son Heung-min‚Äôs clever breakaway goal, it was Manchester City who looked like they needed to become the Harry Kane team. Spurs had found a way to play without Kane, striking on the counterattack, and City had allowed the game to run away from them, their lack of conviction in attack a worry despite the presence of a ¬£100m signing making his first start.\nEarly days, of course, and it is fair to acknowledge that Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side were not at full strength when they began the defence of their title. Context matters in spite of City‚Äôs vast resources and allowances must be made for the absence of Phil Foden, the rustiness of Kevin De Bruyne, and Guardiola levelling the playing field by picking Nathan Ak√© and Benjamin Mendy when John Stones, Kyle Walker and Aymeric Laporte were available.\n Continue reading...",

At an immediate post-9/11 ‚Äúloya jirga‚Äù in the southern city of Kandahar, younger leaders pressed the mullah to expel Bin Laden. Pakistan would probably have forced his surrender sooner or later.

The resulting ‚Äúsoul journey‚Äù is designed to unlock unlimited creativity and wholeness in the psyche of the dancer. Assuming they buy into the new-age framework, that is.

The left blames the right for instigating a cynical distraction from its economic and public health failures; the right insists it is merely acting in self-defence after years of clandestine advances by the left. The indefinite nature of this battle stems from a general failure to define what is being fought over, or to determine what is meant by culture, where it comes from or why it matters.\nOne of the people who thought hardest about the idea of ‚Äúculture‚Äù that so preoccupies today‚Äôs culture warriors was Stuart Hall, the sociologist and founding figure of British cultural studies. Hall arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1951 to find a rigidly hierarchical society that was undergoing profound social changes in the aftermath of the second world war. The ‚ÄúWindrush generation‚Äù had been recruited from the far corners of a fragmenting empire to help rebuild a devastated mother country, bringing with them new music, food and language that would reshape Britain‚Äôs atmosphere. At the same time, television, cinema and radio were spreading a new, irreverent image of British culture around the world, while the rise of the welfare state and increasing disposable income among working people meant the audiences for art and sport were growing just as their barriers of entry began to lower. \n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Upside down, they resemble a pair of scales\nDragonflies have a near-perfect hunting record, successfully grabbing their prey in mid-air 95% of the time: they do this while flying skywards, earthwards, side to side, backwards and upside down. In one experiment, a dragonfly with numbers drawn on its clear wings alights backwards from a reed, legs raised above its head like a person making an offering to God, and scoops up the bug flying behind it. The dragonfly appears to catch its prey both benevolently and malevolently: snatching it and saving it, like a ball or a falling baby.\nDragonflies transform from their larval stage with similarly precise acrobatics: the skin splits, the insect wriggles its head and chest out with the awkwardness of someone trying to get into a sleeping bag while standing up, and then it hangs upside down for a while, its tail still trapped in the skin. The almost-dragonfly regains its strength, then does an upside down sit-up at the same time it pulls and flicks its tail out: a perfectly controlled dismount, a precisely calibrated monkey acrobat toy.\n Continue reading...",

About 4 million workers would have either been forced to return to their jobs or found they had no job at all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Mr Sunak told the BBC, ‚Äúto keep people trapped in a situation and pretend there is always a job that they can go back to.‚Äù But it was Mr Sunak who was wrong. The pandemic was not over. A new, more transmissible Covid variant would soon appear. By October 2020 the furlough was back. Such an experience ought to chasten a politician. But that does not appear to be the chancellor‚Äôs style. He talked last week about the economy ‚Äúbouncing back‚Äù. The furlough, he says, will disappear by the end of September. Is Mr Sunak once again tempting fate?\nBritain has eased pandemic restrictions, but the country is not out of danger. A more virulent Covid strain could emerge. Mr Sunak, however, is betting that vaccine coverage and booster shots will allow Britons to live with the virus. The chancellor can also draw comfort from the Bank of England, which believes that mass layoffs have been averted and unemployment has peaked. The first week of August saw 1.7m active job ads, while 1.9 million people are on furlough. For some this will mean higher pay and better benefits. It may just be catchup. Half of British workers suffered a real-terms pay cut last year despite a sharp rise in average earnings.\n Continue reading...",

The first phase of Cambo would produce up to 170m barrels of crude. That is the equivalent, say Friends of the Earth, of the annual emissions of 18 coal-fired power plants. This sends dark clouds scuttling over the UK‚Äôs presidency of Cop26, held in Glasgow in November this year. For the UN climate summit to be a success, Mr Johnson‚Äôs team, headed by Alok Sharma, must cajole recalcitrant countries into line. It is doubtful that Mr Sharma can persuade other nations of the merit of forsaking fossil fuels when Britain will not lead by example.\nLast week, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its starkest warning yet about the planetary emergency. To have a 50% chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C requires the world to get net emissions of carbon dioxide down to zero before 2050. In a foreword to the IPCC report, Ant√≥nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote that countries should ‚Äúend all new fossil fuel exploration and production‚Äù.

You don‚Äôt really grasp what‚Äôs happening immediately: it‚Äôs too vast and jarring a realisation to gulp down in one go. So you go through phases. First you clutch at straws. Perhaps it‚Äôs a bad joke, or they didn‚Äôt really mean it, or they‚Äôre just misinformed. Then you enter a stage of hot, disorienting rage and frustrated remonstration. Once that is spent, finally you cool off.

A common impulse is to write off those espousing conspiracies, consigning them to the casualties claimed by WhatsApp groups, disinformation or silent mental health issues. These things may be true ‚Äì but vaccine hesitancy is a symptom of broader failures.

          "description": "The artist and social media critic on his work subverting the manipulative practices of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\nWhen the history of the first decades of this century comes to be written, there will be few more telling artworks than Ben Grosser‚Äôs film Order of Magnitude. In the 47 minute video, Grosser, a digital artist and professor of new media at the University of Illinois, has spliced together every public instance in which Mark Zuckerberg has talked of ‚Äúmore‚Äù and ‚Äúbigger‚Äù. The resulting montage of interviews and presentations is a fast forward of the rapid growth of Facebook as, in the chief executive‚Äôs mouth, thousands become millions then billions. It makes a mesmerising monologue, the story of our times.\n‚ÄúThe idea that Zuckerberg latched on to even more than anyone else in Silicon Valley,‚Äù Grosser suggested, when he spoke to me from Urbana via Zoom last week, ‚Äúwas the need to grow as big as fast as possible, get the largest market share. And everything was subservient to that.‚Äù The film is part of a double act. Grosser has also spliced together all the moments he can find of Zuckerberg ever mentioning numbers diminishing or things getting smaller. This film runs for 30 seconds, though in a new version for his forthcoming exhibition at the Arebyte Gallery in London, he has slowed those seconds down so it also runs for 47 minutes.\n Continue reading...",

With her second album, the English singer (who attended the Brit School and is now based in the US) is concerned with confounding first impressions made by 2019‚Äôs Jade Bird, an arresting debut of Americana-tinged pop rock driven by remarkable songcraft and that sweetly serrated force-10 voice.\nAnd yet for all the avowed influences here ‚Äì Blur! Oasis! the Bee Gees! Iggy Pop! PJ Harvey! ‚Äì it‚Äôs to her credit that it still sounds very much like Jade Bird, though notably rockier. There‚Äôs a heaviness of guitar and intent that suits her well, from the dirty, chunky riffs and raw howl of Open Up the Heavens to the Sladey stomp of Honeymoon. Her softer shades are just as beguiling: Punchline leans in to the expansive class of Nashville‚Äôs session musicians (the album was recorded at the storied RCA studios), a rich country-rock short story flashing images such as ‚Äúa wedding band, thrown out the window of a black sedan‚Äù, while Red White and Blue is a delicately killer acoustic ballad.\n Continue reading...",

Yet, played on a modern concert grand with J√§rvi and the strings of a symphony orchestra chugging along in its wake, it all seemed bizarrely anachronistic, as if conjuring up the spirits of Myra Hess and Henry Wood and the Proms of the 1930s.\n Continue reading...",
