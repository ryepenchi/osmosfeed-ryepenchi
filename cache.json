It officially opened, at its delayed press night, to the thrill of a full-capacity audience yet is something of a bumpy production despite its star lead and the inspired central innovation to be play it age-blind.\nDirector Sean Mathias presents a host of interesting ideas yet many fail to take flight. Elsinore is located in a recognisably modern world but lacks a more specific socio-political framework. Pacing is choppy, with scenes passing either too quickly or too slowly. Most criminally, the rich relationships are flattened, from Claudius‚Äôs insecurity and need for Gertrude to Hamlet‚Äôs complicated passion for Ophelia, and so is the exploration of love between siblings and children‚Äôs loyalty to their fathers.

No. Back to life as we knew it means back to queuing at a bar, clearing used cups and trays to find a clean table, and sitting in crowded trains or buses with coughing passengers. For a short while we had freedom to unlock, but on Monday it disappeared. Oh, the irony. \nVally Miller \nWirksworth, Derbyshire\n Continue reading...",

But dating a mate can be risky ‚Äì and if the romance runs out, the friendship may not survive either. With this in mind, we want to hear about your experiences turning a platonic relationship into a romantic one.\nPerhaps you were friends with your partner for years before feelings became more amorous, but found the friendship-first approach to be key to building a lasting relationship? Maybe you discovered that turning your friendship into a love affair also had an impact on the dynamics of your wider social circle? Or perhaps you‚Äôve been secretly in love with a pal, but didn‚Äôt tell them for fear of ruining the friendship.

So Romanticism began on 1 January 1800? Well, Turner and Beethoven were well into their stride by then. And modernism came along on the same date in 1900? Hmm, that makes it hard to account for Van Gogh, Munch and C√©zanne. The National Gallery‚Äôs small but seismic summer exhibition exposes how shallow this thinking is. It does so by bringing together five scenes by a forgotten 18th-century artist, Bernardo Bellotto, whose depictions of deepest Germany, painted in 1756-58, are the first true stirrings of Romantic storminess.\nA name inscribed on the frame of one of the paintings reveals why Bellotto has been so neglected: it calls him Il Canalettino, Little Canaletto, because he was the overshadowed nephew and pupil of the famous painter of the carnivals, gondolas, piazzas and waters of 18th-century Venice. But Bellotto went north, and used the skills his uncle taught him to paint a less picturesque, more troubled Europe.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "McQueen and James Rogan‚Äôs remarkable, intimate documentary meets the survivors of the 1981 fire and looks at its shocking aftermath\nThe New Cross fire, which happened on 18 January 1981, ran through Steve McQueen‚Äôs Small Axe series of films, two of them in particular. It was there as a silent counterpart to Lovers Rock, a kind of photographic negative to the communal joy and celebration of that house party, and it was directly depicted in Alex Wheatle, as one of the sparks that ignited the Brixton Riots. In Uprising (BBC One), McQueen and his co-director James Rogan tell the story of the fire and its aftermath in documentary form, over three primetime episodes. It is brilliant and furious and human.\nThirteen young Black British people were killed at a joint birthday party that night, in a fire widely believed to have been an act of arson committed by racists. The approach Uprising takes is twofold. First, it establishes the cultural context, painting an unflattering portrait of Britain in the 1970s and early 80s. The National Front is on the rise and marching. The police are widely racist; George Rhoden, who joined the force at 16 and was called a traitor by his friends for it, recalls a fellow officer brazenly showing off the National Front badge he had pinned to the inside of his raincoat, just as they were about to police a National Front march. Thatcher‚Äôs 1978 rhetoric is ugly and exploitative; she says that ‚Äúpeople are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture‚Äù. Newspapers reported muggings as crimes exclusively committed by young black men on old white women. ‚ÄúIt felt like they wanted to purge us from the streets,‚Äù says the real Wheatle, who appears here as one of many interviewees.\n Continue reading...",

Looking at a range of indicators, researchers from the Resolution Foundation thinktank did the maths on how 16 months of lockdown had affected households‚Äô wealth. The stark conclusion was that the pandemic had ‚Äúturbo-charged‚Äù the already yawning gap between the rich and the poor.\nUnlike the aftermath of the 2008 crash, when asset prices joined a general economic nosedive, the pandemic produced the oddity of a boom in the middle of a recession. Property values, partly driven by government action to stimulate demand, are now significantly above pre-pandemic levels. Share prices have also been buoyant, although fears over the ongoing spread of the Delta variant led to a downturn this week. Savings amassed while working at home contributed to a ¬£900bn increase in total household wealth. At the top end of the scale, the gap between the richest 10% of families and the median family grew to 55 times the typical household income. By contrast, at the bottom end, families lost income while on furlough, or worked fewer hours, ending up with greater debt than when the pandemic began.\n Continue reading...",

So why did an artwork by Mike Stubbs have to spoil it? That flaming van was a low blow. But there it was, parked on the quay, painted hot-rod red, yellow and black with images of blazing forests. It is called Climate Emergency Services and is even equipped with a gun, perhaps for shooting down denial.\nStubbs demonstrates that it does not always pay to be subtle. I had my appreciation of a sunny day suddenly ruined by his crudely powerful reminder that our weather is no longer natural. But Climate Emergency Services is also a challenge to much of the other art in this three-yearly festival of public art in a chaotically lovely town.

I didn‚Äôt realise Jackie was a fan of the books. He was sitting on an aeroplane somewhere over Scandinavia and he suddenly saw himself mentioned. I don‚Äôt know how much of a crime fiction reader he was, but he was confronted in my books by a larger-than-life male character, John Rebus, who is flawed, complex and awkward socially, who has problems falling in and out of love, and whose job makes him often quite a lonely figure.

Once it gains access, via hitherto unknown flaws in everyday apps, the code can extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones. Such is their ubiquity that mobile phones offer a window into our souls. What spyware, like that hawked by NSO, provides is access to our most intimate secrets.\nOne might have thought those peddling such intrusive powers would have imposed onerous responsibilities. NSO says that it only sells its software to vetted government clients to prevent ‚Äúterrorism and serious crime‚Äù. Unfortunately, that does not appear to have been the case. And it‚Äôs not just NSO. Instead, an unregulated global industry has grown up in the shadows to provide cheap spying tools that were once the preserve of the most advanced state intelligence services.\n Continue reading...",

Days later, ecological crisis struck, in the form of the devastating floods that have overwhelmed western Germany, and parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. More than 190 people are so far known to have died, following flooding of an intensity and scale that has shocked scientists. The record levels of rain in north-west Europe followed record-breaking heat in the Americas. Extreme weather events are becoming the new normal, as climate models have long predicted. But some of the recent spikes have outstripped scientific predictions.\nThe eventual impact of the floods on Germany‚Äôs September election remains to be seen. But this disaster, which the country‚Äôs main political parties have broadly agreed was related to global warming, has thrust the climate crisis to the forefront of the campaign. On Sunday, Angela Merkel, who is standing down as chancellor, insisted that Germany needed to ‚Äúup the pace in the fight against climate change‚Äù. Less impressively, the conservative frontrunner to succeed her, Armin Laschet, was caught on video sharing jokes with bystanders during a visit to a flooded town. As the president of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the worst-hit states, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union can make amends by getting to the bottom of a lethal failure to translate satellite warnings into evacuations on the ground. \n Continue reading...",
