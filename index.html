 1.54am BST 
Third set: Djokovic 4-6 6-2 1-0 Zverev* (*denotes next server)
Well now. Zverev‚Äôs power keeps Djokovic on the run and wraps up two big points. Djokovic takes the next two, but Zverev forces Djokovic to go wide and gets up toward the net for an easy backhand volley and a break point. 
 1.49am BST 
End second set: *Djokovic 4-6 6-2 Zverev (*denotes next server)
Just when you think Zverev has rebounded from his early-set difficulties, he opens this game with an error and a double fault. He follows with an ace, then hits a cross-court shot wide to give Djokovic two break points. He erases the first with an ace. But then he sends a simple backhand long, and that‚Äôs another break for Djokovic in a set in which the Grand Slam contender was able to coast while his challenger came unglued.

If Hurricane Lane runs to within half a stone of his Grand Prix de Paris-winning form in the Cazoo St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, he should win the season‚Äôs final Classic with something to spare.
While Charlie Appleby‚Äôs Irish Derby winner is a worthy favourite, whether he is a worthy odds-on favourite is more debatable. The extra two and a half furlongs on Saturday is an unknown, while on their Derby form at Epsom, Hurricane Lane has something to find with Mojo Star.

&lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;C(#fff) P(20px)&quot;text
&lt;/div
And it will generate CSS like:

Premier League clubs have been cleared to play their Brazilian players this weekend after the country‚Äôs football federation dropped its demand that Fifa impose the five-day rule. The news follows several days of negotiations between the Premier League and Fifa with Chile, Paraguay and Mexico following suit.
It means Liverpool will be able to call upon Alisson and Fabinho for Sunday‚Äôs trip to Leeds, with Raphinha also set to feature for the hosts. The other Brazilian players who were under threat of not playing were Manchester City‚Äôs Ederson and Gabriel Jesus, Thiago Silva at Chelsea, and Fred at Manchester United.

 Less than a month ago, New Zealanders disappeared into their homes, retracting from the public domain like spilled water into a dry sponge. The motorways and city streets stood mostly empty, shops closed, schools and playgrounds were deserted. A single case of the highly contagious Delta variant had been detected and the government called a snap level-4 lockdown, introducing some of the strictest restrictions in the world.
It was a new threat for a country whose Covid-zero pandemic response had been ranked one of the best globally. New Zealand had never faced a Delta outbreak before, and no one knew if its past strategies would prove up to the task.

Four of the nine injured are in serious condition, according to the authorities. A hospital helicopter from nearby Lampedusa island was initially unable to reach the island to provide assistance because of the bad weather.

                    <span>An opening two-hander between Davies as a crime scene cleaner and Helena Bonham Carter as a murderer strikes an odd tone ‚Äì but their quality and ambition just about save the day
The Cleaner (BBC One) is a strange creation, and ‚Äì while intriguing ‚Äì it may turn out to be an acquired taste. Loosely inspired by the German comedy series Der Tatortreiniger (Crime Scene Cleaner), it is written by Greg Davies, who also stars as Paul ‚ÄúWicky‚Äù Wickstead, a cleaner sent to mop up the messes left behind after gruesome killings and untimely deaths. (The title and setup slightly spoil the first joke, where he arrives as if he is a detective, only to slap down his tray of solvents and cloths.) Each week, Wicky visits a different house; each week he deals with a different ‚Äúclient‚Äù, to put business-speak to deservedly macabre use.
In this opening episode he is tasked with making a suburban kitchen look normal again after a murder, rather than the way it looks as he arrives, which is as if someone has shoved a cow in a blender and used the results as wallpaper paste. He soon finds himself engaged in a game of cat and mouse with ‚Äúthe Widow‚Äù, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who is phenomenally watchable in just about everything she does, including this. Here, she is at peak HBC ‚Äì dishevelled, reaching for madness, and in a stylishly oversized coat. The Widow stabbed her husband 38 times. ‚ÄúYou only need five stabs,‚Äù Wicky grumbles. ‚ÄúAnything else is showboating.‚Äù

                    <span>The ‚Äòcalming influence‚Äô of coach Andrew Richardson, her physio, agent and LTA heads of tennis have all lent support
If Emma Raducanu‚Äôs surprise run to the fourth round of Wimbledon in July was a life-changing experience, then her journey to a maiden grand slam final at the US Open has ensured that it will never be the same.
By defeating Maria Sakkari, the 17th seed, 6-1, 6-4 on Thursday, Raducanu became the first qualifier in history to reach a grand slam final. She has done so in only her fourth tour-level event since she started her full-time professional tennis career after finishing her A-levels in the summer.

A tattoo‚Äôs permanence was once considered part of the package, equally a source of frisson-like appeal and finger-wagging peril. But as tattoo removal grows more commonplace, many of those associations are now in flux.
In recent years the laser removal process ‚Äì which breaks up the ink into smaller fragments that can be spirited away by the body ‚Äì has been embraced by many of the celebrities who helped cement body art‚Äôs 2010s pop culture ascendancy, from the Kardashians to the Osbournes. Recently, Saturday Night Live‚Äôs Pete Davidson set about scrubbing his famously inked frame ‚Äì which spans the gamut from stoner gags to famous exes ‚Äì in order to pursue more film roles.

In London that day, writing for daily newspapers for an Australia mostly asleep during the attacks on the twin towers and the Pentagon, watching the TV live when the second aircraft struck, the myriad hot media and political takes about what it meant and what must happen next only added to confusion.
There seemed but one certainty on that day when the terrorists turned passenger jets into ballistic missiles against America. It was that the United States, always the righteous, ever the good, would retaliate disproportionately against whoever was responsible.

This tale of a claustrophobic mother-daughter relationship takes contrived turns, but the starkly moving performances remain compelling
Much has changed in Ireland since Martin McDonagh‚Äôs black comedy premiered in 1996, but the ramshackle Connemara hillside where this savage mother-daughter psychodrama plays out feels both petrified in perpetual darkness and newly, terribly, resonant.
This corner of Leenane ‚Äì malodorous, ragged and inhabited by left-behinds ‚Äì seems to be in a state of existential lockdown and every character emanates claustrophobic isolation. Maureen (Orla Fitzgerald), the middle-aged virgin living a ball-and-chain existence with her mother Mag (Ingrid Craigie) is its tortured heart, eaten up by rage and resentment towards the scheming, needy Mag.

On an industrial road in Coburg, in Melbourne‚Äôs north, there‚Äôs a tale of two facilities. Both are filled with razor-sharp industrial slicers, grinders, hundreds of long needles to pump marinades, and machines that fill and twist silky alginate casings, made from refined seaweed, to produce up to 400 sausages a minute.
One turns out beef patties and butterflied lamb legs, mainly destined for national supermarkets. The adjacent, newer plant has almost identical equipment but no meat at all.

                    <span>His Manchester United return feels like a statement of power from a man who has cultivated a brand of individualistic devotion
In the aftermath of Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs shock return to Manchester United last week, there was a good deal of feverish speculation about whether he would reclaim the famous No 7 shirt once worn by United legends such as George Best, Bryan Robson and Eric Cantona, and which now forms a central part of his ‚ÄúCR7‚Äù personal brand.
But there was more than iconography and nostalgia involved here. The No 7 shirt already had an occupant: striker Edinson Cavani, and under Premier League rules Cavani was required to retain it for the season. Yet when you are as famous as Ronaldo, it turns out that there is an extent to which you can make up your own rules. When you see something you want, you don‚Äôt get too hung up on niceties and boundaries. You take it, as firmly and assuredly as if it had been yours all along.

                    <span>An all-star cast and some showstoppingly horrible hair can‚Äôt save Ridley Scott‚Äôs medieval epic
Duelling got Ridley Scott into cinema back in 1977 with his much-admired debut The Duellists, but that was a brisk affair of rapiers at dawn. Medieval jousting is likely to be more cumbersome and clanking, and so it is in The Last Duel. Scott is revered as one of cinema‚Äôs most versatile mainstreamers but, barring Gladiator, his historical epics have tended not to win much adoration ‚Äì something that is unlikely to change with this account of a real-life 14th-century case of rape and rivalry.
The feud is between nobles Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), who fall out after the latter wins the favour of Count Pierre d‚ÄôAlen√ßon (Ben Affleck), with De Carrouges losing his destined captaincy and a desired piece of land, part of his promised dowry in his marriage to Marguerite de Thibouville (Jodie Comer). The film begins in 1386, with the men beginning armoured combat in front of King Charles VI, then jumps back to trace the story up to the point when Marguerite tells her husband that Le Gris has raped her.

In the week his Mercedes departure was confirmed, however, any consolation Bottas might have taken from the win was tempered by more ill-fortune. Bottas had to take a full new power unit beyond Mercedes‚Äô allocation before qualifying, and will start from the back of the grid in Sunday‚Äôs main race regardless of how he performs on Saturday.

Massive Attack said it is ‚Äúreally disappointing‚Äù to cancel a Liverpool gig in order to boycott a venue where a major weapons fair is due to be held next month.
Robert ‚Äú3D‚Äù Del Naja, one of the Bristol band‚Äôs founding members, said the move was to show solidarity with the people of Liverpool, where campaigners have launched a legal challenge in an attempt to stop the controversial electronic arms fair taking place.

                    <span>In the two decades since the terror attack on New York City, films and TV shows have tried to revisit or reflect on a culturally traumatic event
A common refrain in the days after 11 September 2001 was that the scenes of unthinkable destruction looked like a movie. In some ways, it did: the World Trade Center had been destroyed on-screen in three late-90s blockbusters: Independence Day, Deep Impact and Armageddon. Overnight, movies with bombastic scenes of mass violence all but disappeared; for years afterwards, the attacks themselves, whose imagery saturated the national consciousness, proved too traumatic, too untouchable, to be reimagined for film or TV.

It seemed, at the start of the match, as if Heaven Help Us CC might just live up to their name. The young curate opening the batting was bowled second ball and it was clear the opposition‚Äôs pacy opening bowler ‚Äì we‚Äôll call him Khalid, although that‚Äôs not his real name ‚Äì was going to be a handful.
Like everyone playing in the Refugee Council XI on Thursday, Khalid had been displaced from Afghanistan. Here at Beckenham sports ground he and his teammates were playing a side made up of faith leaders, human rights lawyers and the odd ringer. If you were hunting for an image of sport as a force for good, you wouldn‚Äôt find one more picturesque: a lush green outfield, a vicar taking a hat-trick, a rabbi fasting in the field; Chris Lewis, the former England all-rounder, donning blue latex gloves and serving refreshments; young refugees finding a place of belonging in their new home.

Google executives have been aware since at least May 2019 that the company was failing to comply with local laws in the UK, Europe and Asia that mandate temporary workers be paid equal rates to full-time employees performing similar work, internal Google documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian show.

Healthy boys may be more likely to be admitted to hospital with a rare side-effect of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine that causes inflammation of the heart than with Covid itself, US researchers claim.
Their analysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with Covid over a four-month period.

GPs in England are ‚Äúfinding it increasingly hard to guarantee safe care‚Äù for millions of patients as a shortage of medics means they are unable to cope with soaring demand, Britain‚Äôs top family doctor has warned.
Amid a debate over access to face-to-face appointments, Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP), defended the growing use of remote consultations during the pandemic.

                    <span>The devastating al-Qaida attack, and America‚Äôs response, had far-reaching consequences which are still developing
A new and deadly era began when the planes sliced into the twin towers on the morning of 11 September 2001. That evening, the historian Tony Judt wrote that he had seen the 21st century begin. The nearly 3,000 lives stolen by al-Qaida were only a small part of the toll. The horror began a chain of events that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, including huge numbers of civilians abroad and many US military personnel. It is still unfolding.
If the killing of the plot‚Äôs mastermind Osama bin Laden a few months before the 10th anniversary perhaps let some hope that an end to that new era might be in sight, there can be no such false confidence at the 20th. The establishment of a Taliban government in Kabul, two decades after the US ousted the militants for harbouring Bin Laden, has underscored two things: that far from reasserting its global supremacy, the US looks more vulnerable today; and that the echoes of 9/11 are still reverberating across the region ‚Äì but will not stay there.

                    <span>The Ig Nobels are a reminder that Jonathan Swift was wrong about reason. Without research driven by curiosity, there would be far fewer breakthroughs
In Gulliver‚Äôs Travels, Jonathan Swift mocked the assumption that the scientific revolution had transformed European culture for the better. The satirical novel, published in 1726, has its eponymous hero stumbling upon ‚Äúthe Academy‚Äù in the fictional city of Lagado, and pokes fun at the idea that a scientific temperament could be useful. Swift describes pointless experiments to extract sunbeams from cucumbers and to build houses from the roof downwards. His book is laced with sardonic wit. But unorthodox, even absurd, thinking is necessary for science to progress.
That point has been underlined by this week‚Äôs winners of the Ig Nobel prize, established in 1991 by an American magazine called the Annals of Improbable Research. One of the honoured investigations this year was by Robin Radcliffe, of Cornell University, who looked at whether it was safer to transport an anesthetised rhinoceros upside down airborne or lying on its side on a sledge. Prof Radcliffe showed animals‚Äô health would not be jeopardised by being hung by their legs beneath a helicopter, a technique becoming more popular in African conservation.

Their cluster of mud houses, fields and pomegranate orchards was the site of perhaps the most notorious massacre of the war, when US SSgt Robert Bales walked out of a nearby base to slaughter local families in cold blood. He killed 16 people, nine of them children.

                    <span>The US‚Äôs departure has prompted a national sense of shame and a recognition there will be no victory in the ‚Äòwar on terror‚Äô

Ben Rhodes was a US deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration

Foreign policy, for better or worse, is always an extension of a nation‚Äôs domestic politics. The arc of America‚Äôs war in Afghanistan is a testament to this reality ‚Äì the story of a superpower that overreached, slowly came to terms with the limits of its capacity to shape events abroad, and withdrew in the wake of raging dysfunction at home. Viewed through this prism, President Joe Biden‚Äôs decisive yet chaotic withdrawal comes into focus.
The story begins with trauma and hubris. On September 11 2001, American power was at its high-water mark. The globalisation of open markets, democratic governance, and the US-led international order had shaped the previous decade. The spectre of nuclear war had been lifted, the ideological debates of the 20th century settled. To Americans, mass violence was something that took place along the periphery of the post-cold war world. And then suddenly, the periphery struck the centres of American power, killing thousands.

It‚Äôs harder to know exactly who to be angry at, though.

Designed to pay for the NHS and social care, the tax overhaul will result in about 1.3 million working pensioners over the age of 65 paying national insurance (NI) contributions on their earnings for the first time.

Many family members of the nearly 3,000 victims killed on that day are expected to gather in downtown Manhattan, in a field in Shanksville, and at the Pentagon, where the terrorists crashed the passenger jets they had seized that morning.

Israel says it will prosecute dozens of pilgrims returning from Ukraine who flew back into the country with fake negative Covid test results.
The pilgrims had been attending the annual celebration of the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, in the Ukrainian city of Uman, where Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who founded the Hasidic Breslov sect in the early 19th century, is buried. He was a great-grandson of the founder of Hasidism.

                    <span>Social care should be fully returned to the public sector, writes David Hinchliffe, while Pam Clarke says privatisation has been a failed experiment and Roger Fisken says Labour should defend high taxes for decent public service provision
Your editorial concerning Boris Johnson‚Äôs announcement on health and social care funding (7 September) rightly draws attention to the detrimental effects of the organisational split between two branches of the same tree. The ludicrous situation of having free care on one side and charges on the other is made even more laughable when no one is able to establish the division between the two with any certainty.
Pre-Tony Blair, the Labour party was seriously looking at the idea of a formal merger between the NHS and social care, and the principle has been endorsed by the Commons‚Äô health committee on a number of occasions. The extension of universal taxpayer-funded provision to enable free social care hasn‚Äôt just been a problem for the Conservatives, but also for New Labour. However, alongside a gradual return of social care to the public sector, it is the only way to effectively address what Johnson terms the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù in the sector, and your editorial correctly points out how this could be funded.

                    <span>The prime minister promises to ‚Äòlevel up‚Äô, yet his policies will level down. That gives the opposition a chance they should seize
What do you do when your sworn enemy insists on wearing your clothes? The question looms large after a week when Boris Johnson once again dressed himself up in deepest red, introducing a new tax that aims to raise ¬£12bn a year to tackle the NHS backlog and fix social care, the sort of high-tax, high-spend move that was once anathema to the Conservative party and the exclusive preserve of Labour.
But it‚Äôs a question Johnson has been posing for his opponents for much longer. In the 2019 election, he won seats that had historically voted Labour with promises of ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù that were premised on a big, active state, ditching Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs blue twinset for a slash of Labour red. Indeed, ideological cross-dressing has been a thread through Johnson‚Äôs career. He was twice elected mayor in Labour-dominated London thanks in part to a range of red accessories, including support for an amnesty for undocumented migrants, all swiftly discarded when they fell out of fashion.

The existence of adult social care waiting lists is deeply shocking (Nearly 300,000 on adult social care ‚Äòwaiting lists‚Äô in England, 8 September). Children‚Äôs social care has also taken a terrible turn this week.
New legislation has come into force which rations care on the basis of age. The law now requires that children in care always receive day‚Äëto-day care and supervision where they live, but only if they are aged 15 and younger. No such guarantee has been given to 16- and 17-year-olds, who are increasingly placed into accommodation without any adult carers and only occasional support.

Fast food chains are running out of chicken. Hauliers‚Äô wage bills are going through the roof. Crops are rotting in the fields. The scale of Britain‚Äôs supply chain meltdown is the worst since the 1970s, when the three-day week, power cuts and industrial disputes saw rubbish pile up in the streets.
Fast forward four decades and the shortages in modern Britain stem from Covid-19 disrupting an intricate network of global supply chains where the slightest problem throws the whole system. Brexit has added to the rebooted anarchy in the UK, with years of chronic underinvestment in people and infrastructure, both from government and business, painfully exposed.

Australia‚Äôs covert overseas spy agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, opened a base in Santiago to assist in the US Central Intelligence Agency‚Äôs destabilisation of the Chilean government ahead of the bloody military coup against Salvador Allende‚Äôs socialist government 48 years ago today.
Declassified Australian government documents prove that in December 1970 Liberal foreign minister and later prime minister, Billy McMahon, approved an Asis request to open the base. For 18 months from 1971, according to the US-based National Security Archive, Asis apparently conducted covert operations in Chile ‚Äì including handling CIA-recruited Chilean assets in Santiago and filing intelligence reports to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

                    <span>Your mother sounds depressed and anxious, says Annalisa Barbieri. The first port of call is her GP, to get her checked over physically and emotionally
I‚Äôm worried about my mum. She‚Äôs in her early 80s, has mobility problems and seems depressed. Every phone call with her usually ends with her sobbing or getting angry. She doesn‚Äôt like her GP and isn‚Äôt in touch with them much. I think her health and mobility could be improved with treatment, but she says there‚Äôs no point bothering anyone.
She gets angry a lot and bickers at my stepdad, who seems quite long-suffering. When I visit, she usually gets upset when I leave and then cries. She seems lonely, but not keen to reach out to her friends ‚Äì she appears to feel that people should always call her, not that she should call them. She doesn‚Äôt have any hobbies and is frustrated by her lack of mobility. When I try to suggest things she could do, she says it‚Äôs all ‚Äúpointless‚Äù.

Boris Johnson‚Äôs taxation plans may have sailed through the Commons, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre sitting well with his party. Instead, the prime minister‚Äôs push to define a new centre ground has put him at loggerheads with some of his oldest supporters. The politician they had put their faith in to usher in a new era of free market conservatism is treading a path that goes against their values ‚Äì and what they had envisaged when he entered No 10.
Since Johnson used his first week back after the summer recess to break not one but two manifesto pledges ‚Äì raising national insurance and reneging on the pensions triple lock for a year ‚Äì a backlash is under way that goes well beyond the House of Commons.

Houseparty, a video chat app that surged in popularity when lockdowns were first imposed last year, is to close down.
The platform allows people to virtually drop in to video chatrooms with friends and experienced a spike in demand during the first wave of Covid restrictions, reporting 50m sign-ups in one month. Houseparty is owned by the same company that makes Fortnite and it was integrated into the smash-hit game last year, allowing users to hold video chats while playing.

The most-watched fashion show of New York fashion week will not take place on a catwalk. On Monday evening, on the steps of the city‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art, the singer Billie Eilish, the poet Amanda Gorman, the actor Timoth√©e Chalamet and the tennis player Naomi Osaka will dress up to the nines to host the Met Gala, known as fashion‚Äôs Oscar night. At the last Met Gala, in 2019, Lady Gaga made four costume changes on the red carpet. Rihanna, whose past Met Gala looks have included a giant ‚Äúomelette‚Äù dress and a pope costume, has sent out invites to an after-party.
But despite the outlandish fashion, the night will have a serious message as the gala opening of what is set to be the most politically charged fashion exhibition ever staged by a major museum.

On the one hand, it makes huge sense for Jeff Bezos to pour millions into a company seeking the secret to eternal life. Karmic reincarnation may only be an outside possibility. But Jeff should hedge against the likelihood that under that scenario, he‚Äôs coming back as a Yemeni woman.
Further developments in fauxlanthropy for the Amazon overlord, then, who has decided that death is as inevitable as taxes. Which is to say: not at all inevitable for the likes of him. Bezos was this month reported to be a significant investor in Altos Labs, an age-reversal firm which is on the scientific quest for immortality. Among other expansions, it is thought the firm will now open a lab within the UK, which I think you‚Äôll agree means so much more to our nation than a fair tax contribution from Amazon. You know we‚Äôd only spend that shit on social care or the NHS or something, when Jeff can see it‚Äôs far better for us to get people on ordinary incomes to pay extra for all that, so that guys like him are freed up to spaff their money on Earth‚Äôs most preposterous midlife crises. How else to interpret the fact that this eternal-life news emerged in the very week it was revealed that despite Amazon UK sales increasing by ¬£1.89bn last year, the firm paid just ¬£3.8m more corporation tax?

The consumer watchdog has called for much tougher government vetting of private companies selling Covid-19 tests to travellers, following revelations about poor service from ‚Äúrogue‚Äù operators that it said had resulted in a lottery for customers.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the market for PCR tests, in which private businesses apply for inclusion on a government-approved list, was not working and risked causing a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù among companies touting for customers.

                    <span>Jack O‚ÄôConnell faces down Stephen Graham in a rousing drama that requires no deep thought and provides fathomless fun
It is September, and time for the televisual equivalent of 40 denier tights, sweaters and defiantly unsalady food at last. BBC Two has provided it, in the form of five-part series The North Water, directed by Andrew Haigh and adapted by him from Ian McGuire‚Äôs book of the same name.
It‚Äôs got just what you need as the nights draw in. The plot is a meaty, satisfying stew that is not going to trouble your mental digestion. We are in Hull in 1859 and we open with a group of boys poking a dead dog with sticks, and a sexual tryst between a man and a lady of the night. The man in question is a black-hearted drunkard named Henry Drax (Colin Farrell, burdened by the kind of wig that should have been outlawed by the Hague by now).

To the disappointment of about 55,000 runners, the sign for the event did not go up in 2020. ‚ÄúIt was a bit of a damp squib,‚Äù says Snaith, referring not just to the run itself but the absence of group training sessions and the annual socials that also fell victim to Covid.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was largely driven by declines in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which have been particularly hit by the need for separate regulatory approval post Brexit.

‚ÄúAlready over the next few weeks we will file the results of our trial in five- to 11-year-olds with regulators across the world and will request approval of the vaccine in this age group, also here in Europe,‚Äù BioNTech‚Äôs chief medical officer, √ñzlem T√ºreci, told the German news magazine Der Spiegel.

                    <span>Exclusive: revelations come amid rising concerns over government‚Äôs plans to meet net zero target
UK government ministers have held private meetings with fossil fuel and biomass energy producers roughly nine times as often as they met companies involved in clean energy production, despite the increasing urgency of meeting the government‚Äôs climate targets.
Analysis by DeSmog, the environmental investigation group, of publicly available data shows that ministers from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) held 63 private meetings ‚Äì with one company present, along with ministers and advisers ‚Äì with fossil fuel and biomass energy producers between 22 July 2019 and 18 March 2021.

                    <span>Robert Jenrick‚Äôs madcap policy will hand shops over to developers motivated by profit, not community
The summer of 2021 may be remembered for Covid and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But another lasting and insidious change took place: the death of the high street. By approving the building of residential homes on ailing shopping streets, planning minister Robert Jenrick effectively allowed any shop, restaurant, cafe or business premise in England to become a house. Since almost everywhere houses make more money, this puts every high street under threat.
Although done in the name of creating ‚Äúthriving town centres‚Äù, Jenrick‚Äôs policy will strip away the cohesion that still binds many communities together, urban as well as rural. The diversity of English towns and cities has long been protected by planners enforcing classes of use. Restaurants and shops could not simply become houses without planning permission. But as of last month, if any landlord thinks to profit by turning the use of one building into another, it will require no permission to do so. A building need only to have been vacant for three months (after Covid-19, this already applies to one in seven shops, and could easily be achieved by eviction). Hit by lockdown, online shopping and the end of rental holidays, high street shops are struggling to survive. They need time to recover, not Jenrick kicking them in the teeth and sending their landlords cheering to the bank.

A 100-year-old care home resident has issued a video plea for greater freedom, complaining that thousands of people can go to pop festivals but she is being prevented from seeing two of her children at her home in Yorkshire.
Frances Heaton said ‚Äúhuman rights and equality are out of order altogether‚Äù, as 240,000 people signed a petition demanding a new law ending isolation for care home residents, with many saying care operators are still refusing to follow government advice on facilitating visits and are imposing their own stricter regimes. The petition is titled: ‚ÄúPlease let me hug my family before it‚Äôs too late!‚Äù.

                    <span>As both the climate crisis and development intensify, Black cemeteries are now at a disproportionate risk of being lost, some before they have even been officially found 
On a cloudy weekend day in May, Jennifer Blanks took a trip to Canaan cemetery in Bryan, Texas. The six-acre site is the final resting place for a community of primarily Black farmers and veterans, with generations stretching back to the 1800s. Among the interred is Powell Harvey, the first Black man to serve as the Brazos county constable.
If Blanks hadn‚Äôt known this before visiting, though, she might have missed many of the graves completely.

In 1995, when I was 20, I moved to Enumclaw, a farming town in the US state of Washington, to be close to my brother and his family. I rented an apartment. My room was on the top floor but on my first night, lying in bed, I heard footsteps above me. Over the months, I started to notice things going missing. I would buy a six-pack of soda, drink one, come home from work and find only four left. It was the same with packets of soup and ramen noodles. I also noticed that doors I had left open were closed, or vice versa.
Mostly, I found it amusing ‚Äì I assumed that my brother, who had a key, was coming over and eating my food. (Looking back, I should have known it wasn‚Äôt him because there would have been dirty dishes everywhere.)

                    <span>Poet Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan and standup comedian Nabil Abdul Rashid both came of age in the early 2000s, as Britain‚Äôs Muslim communities were feeling the backlash from 9/11. In conversation with Nosheen Iqbal, they look back at the past two decades and ahead to what the future holds for Britain‚Äôs Muslims


The 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that we have been reflecting on in Today in Focus had a particular effect on Britain‚Äôs Muslim communities. For many, the shock and outrage they felt was quickly followed by fear of reprisals against them. What followed was a relentless demonisation in some parts of the media, abuse in the streets, and legal measures such as control orders and the government‚Äôs Prevent anti-radicalisation programme that appeared to target their communities. 
 Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan was raised in Leeds in the 1990s as a Muslim, the eldest child of second generation British Pakistani parents. She describes striving to fit in at school and do all that was asked of her, eventually winning a place at Cambridge University and going on to become a successful poet. But she tells Nosheen Iqbal of her realisation that nothing she did could insulate her from subtle ‚Äì and overt ‚Äì Islamophobia. It was worst, she says, around the anniversary of 9/11 and in the immediate aftermath of other terrorist attacks.

A third of the female service members in the air force and space force say they‚Äôve experienced sexual harassment, according to a new study. 
The AP reports:
The review, done by the Air Force inspector general concluded that minorities and women are underrepresented in leadership and officer positions, particularly at the senior levels, and get promoted less frequently. It echoed many of the findings of an initial review, released last December, which found that Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct.
The two reviews into racial, ethnic and gender disparities across the Air Force and Space Force broadly confirm that biases exist, but the data does not fully explain why. The studies also reflect broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism.

Channeling national frustration as the virus surges back, the US president adopted his sternest tone yet in reprimanding the tens of millions of Americans who are still not vaccinated against the coronavirus.

British musician Phil Collins says he can barely hold a drum stick because of deteriorating health that has also forced him to sit while singing during live performances.
The 70-year-old drummer and singer told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Thursday that he was frustrated at the challenges he faced. He underwent surgery on his back in 2009 and again in 2015 that affected his nerves, and he also has diabetes.

Scrapping the ¬£1,000-a-year boost to universal credit next month will trigger mental illness and poorer health for thousands of people, and hit the sickest areas of the UK hardest, new research suggests.
Boris Johnson‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù is thrown into doubt by the Health Foundation study, which comes as ministers are already facing criticism for a national insurance hike that will leave low-paid workers hundreds of pounds out of pocket. The ditching of the universal credit (UC) uplift, 19 months after it was brought in amid the pandemic, will be significantly worse for the poorest households.

Cristiano Ronaldo is good at football. That seems like a strange thing to write, but the certainty with which some have proclaimed his return to Manchester United a likely failure makes it a point worth revisiting. Of course there are reservations ‚Äì will he press? Is Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r prepared to leave him out or take him off? ‚Äì but these do not outweigh the realities. Over the past few seasons, United have struggled to score tap-ins, headers and in the biggest games, problems that perhaps the greatest ever goal machine might address, just as the addition of a monomaniacal winner might benefit a callow squad. It is already clear that Ronaldo‚Äôs arrival has inspired his new teammates, but his effect on opponents who know they are likely to be outmatched should not be underestimated. Starting with Newcastle on Saturday, those who have to actually play against Ronaldo will not be so dismissive. DH

The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said the law that went into effect last week after the supreme court refused to block it and bans almost all abortions in the state was one ‚Äúall Americans should fear‚Äù.

Gen Hugo Carvajal, who for over a decade was Hugo Ch√°vez‚Äôs eyes and ears in the military, was arrested on Thursday night at a small apartment where he had been holed up.

A worsening wildfire that kept advancing through forest land and prompted the evacuation of nearly 1,000 residents has claimed the life of one firefighter, authorities in southern Spain said late on Thursday.
The blaze in a mountain range of the province of M√°laga broke out late on Wednesday and grew, fanned by winds of up to 50km/h that constantly shifted directions. Nine hundred and forty people were evacuated near the resort town of Estepona and three other municipalities, the Andalusia regional authorities said.

It was easy to imagine the gravelly tones of the voiceover from those epic Hollywood movie trailers. Everything was quiet in the England camp. A little too quiet. Gareth Southgate smiled when the notion was put to him before Wednesday night‚Äôs World Cup qualifier against Poland in Warsaw.
There was a time, the England manager admitted, when he would worry if things were going smoothly to the extent that he would ‚Äúgo looking for problems‚Äù. He knows now it is simply better to enjoy the good periods, which these had been with five wins out of five on the road to Qatar 2022, because, well, this is England and one moment can wholly distort the narrative.

                    <span>With theatre for an audience of one, a whirlwind set of Kevin Barry stories and sparky songs, the Irish festival is in fine form
Adapting to Covid-19 restrictions with ingenuity, Galway international arts festival has embraced hybrid forms of performance: live in theatres, streamed, filmed, recorded for headsets or available for a single audience member to encounter alone. In the case of Attic Projects‚Äô arresting Volcano (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ), presented in four 45-minute parts, viewers have the intense experience of solo viewing in an individual booth, combined with glimpses of other audience members through glass screens. It can also be watched online in four episodes, like a television mini-series.
Cameras and screens are integral to this ambitious multimedia performance by dance-theatre artists Luke Murphy and Will Thompson, who play X and Y, cooped up in a dingy sitting room with no obvious exit. Think Sartre, Beckett or Enda Walsh, with more choreography. Memories of their lives prior to this mysterious co-dependency are played out in superbly inventive movement sequences ‚Äì from tender duets to manic raves ‚Äì triggered by a radio signal that becomes increasingly distorted. For a work created during lockdown, this is unexpectedly exhilarating: its sci-fi premise of a time-capsule sent into space being sufficiently expansive to encompass Covid-inspired questions of what is really of value in life, what is worth saving ‚Äì and what remains when habitual bonds have loosened.

                    <span>This three-part series takes an unsensationalist approach in recounting how police pursued five innocent men for the murder of Lynette White in Cardiff in 1988
The year is 1988, and the mutilated body of a 20-year-old woman is found in a flat in Cardiff. Four witnesses come forward to say they saw a pale, brown-haired man with a bloodied hand, outside, soon after the murder, crying and muttering incoherently to himself. After a 10-month investigation the police arrest and charge five black and mixed-race men, all of whom have alibis. A Killing in Tiger Bay (BBC Two) tells the story ‚Äì in three hour-long episodes and granular, unsensationlist detail ‚Äì of what happened, along with the subsequent convictions of three of them and the international outcry that saw those convictions eventually overturned.
As with most miscarriages of justice, the case is both unbelievable and only too believable. Unbelievable because, well, see above. And only too believable because of the way we know systemic bias and individual prejudice work and how they produce results that have a perverted logic of their own.

California is expected to outlaw ‚Äústealthing‚Äù, becoming the first state to make it illegal to remove a condom without verbal consent during sex.
Legislators have sent a bill to the state‚Äôs governor, Gavin Newsom, that would add the act to California‚Äôs civil definition of sexual battery. The bill would amend the civil code, allowing victims to sue perpetrators for damages, but would not change the criminal code to make it a crime that would send perpetrators to jail.

Tim Paine, their captain, looked to gee up his players before the subsequent fifth Test at the Oval, dubbing it their ‚ÄúGrand Final‚Äù in a nod to the other major codes back home. But what followed was the performance of a team that had experienced its moment a week earlier. England won, the series was drawn 2-2 and Cricket Australia‚Äôs fly-on-the-wall documentary did not get the final flourish its editors had hoped for.

                    <span>The man who shattered Djokovic‚Äôs Olympic dream could stop him winning a calendar-year grand slam at the US Open, too
Two more matches. Six more sets. Those are the only remaining obstacles separating Novak Djokovic from becoming the first male player to win the calendar-year grand slam since Rod Laver in 1969 while also winning his 21st grand slam title, breaking his tie with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But as he rounds on his final hurdles, standing before him are the most difficult tasks to come. On Friday he will face the surging Alexander Zverev in the semi-final, and if he wins possibly Daniil Medvedev, the second seed, in the final.
Over the course of the summer, Zverev, the fourth seed, has come to represent the biggest source of friction in Djokovic‚Äôs historic season. Just over a month ago, the Serb was seemingly powering towards his elusive Olympic gold medal and he led Zverev 6-1, 3-2 in the semi-final with a break of serve. But then, in a flash, it was gone. He lost 10 of the next 11 games and after starting the match with a 22-match winning streak, he lost three matches, two each in singles and one in mixed doubles, within 24 hours, as well as pulling out of the mixed doubles bronze-medal match. He left Tokyo exhausted. ‚ÄúI played great, great tennis. Then unfortunately [my] game fell apart. It happens,‚Äù he said on Wednesday about the loss against Zverev, after his four-set win over Matteo Berrettini.

The SNP government‚Äôs proposal was passed with support from the Scottish Greens, who signed a cooperation deal with the Scottish government last month. It was despite Green co-leader Patrick Harvie previously warning that vaccine passports posed ‚Äúa real danger of generational injustice‚Äù.

EasyJet, the dominant airline at Gatwick , said the ‚Äúunsolicited approach‚Äù from an unnamed bidder was unanimously rejected by its board.

                    <span>Wizz Air‚Äôs offer was rejected, of course, but ¬£1.2bn rights issue hardly put fizz back into shares
The pandemic has transformed the airline industry in unexpected ways: Wizz Air, whose shares have recovered all the altitude lost in the early months of lockdown, is now bigger in stock market terms than easyJet. The latter‚Äôs shares are stuck at half their old level and ¬£3.25bn valuation now compares with ¬£5bn for Wizz.
The position is quite a comedown for easyJet, and Wizz‚Äôs cheeky takeover bid, one suspects, will have come as a blow to the corporate ego. It had to be rejected, of course, because it would have been an act of desperation to contemplate an all-share deal on ‚Äúlow premium‚Äù terms at today‚Äôs valuation. Life is tough for easyJet, a UK-skewed operator more exposed than most to UK travel restrictions and the absurd price of PRC tests, but this is not a moment to give up.

The Conservative party co-chair, Ben Elliot, has been warned by an official watchdog that he should separate his public and business roles more clearly, following complaints that the high-end concierge company he runs engages in lobbying.
In a written summary of investigation, the Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists said that while Elliot had been cleared of any wrongdoing, he should nonetheless take action in the future.

Labour has condemned the prime minister‚Äôs plan for a 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) as unfair ‚Äì but has so far declined to say how it would raise the funds.

One in three (32.7%) BAME staff in mental health settings have experienced abuse, according to analysis by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. For BAME workers across the NHS, the rate is more than one in four (28.9%).

Ministers have piled pressure on the vaccines watchdog to approve a large-scale programme of Covid booster injections in time for winter, as the number of people in hospital with the virus exceeded 8,000 for the first time since March.
On Thursday the UK‚Äôs medicines regulator granted emergency approval for the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to be used as third shots to tackle potentially waning immunity, also putting pressure on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to approve a new jab programme.

The failures at Cawston Park Hospital near Aylsham should prompt a review to prevent further ‚Äúlethal outcomes‚Äù at similar sites, the report, commissioned by Norfolk Safeguarding Adults Board (NSAB), concluded. It suggested that such facilities should ‚Äúcease to receive public money‚Äù.

                    <span>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is taking a high-risk gamble in which the people of Northern Ireland are likely to pay a heavy price
The threat by the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, to collapse the Stormont executive unless the Northern Ireland protocol is scrapped risks creating a crisis for electoral gain. Some in the DUP may think that bringing down the power-sharing executive works to their advantage. But it‚Äôs a high-risk gamble in which the public would almost certainly pay a heavy price.
Before Covid struck, the region had spent three years without an assembly, leaving it with the longest NHS waiting lists in the UK. If the day-to-day running of Northern Ireland passed to the civil service, it is hard to see how decisions in the public interest to pull out of the pandemic could be made by unelected officials. Brexit was the catalyst for rioting in Northern Ireland earlier this year. Tensions are best defused in a democratic arena, not on the streets.

                    <span>New carbon capture technology should be welcomed. But weaning the world off coal, oil and gas is what matters most
The switching on of the world‚Äôs largest carbon capture and storage plant, in Iceland, is a glimmer of hope in a bleak climate landscape. The amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by this new machine will be tiny: 4,000 tonnes a year, which is equivalent to that produced by 870 cars. Still, the project brings a step closer the possibility that significant amounts of carbon dioxide could, one day, be removed from the atmosphere.
The significant risks that such technological developments carry must be addressed head-on. The danger is that they are a displacement activity from the massive and necessary task of reducing and then eliminating emissions (with any residual emissions offset or, if carbon capture technologies are scaled up, removed). This distraction need not be deliberate, although fossil fuel producers have consistently undermined climate action by promoting the idea that technological solutions will eventually make calls to decarbonise obsolete.

                    <span>New star of British tennis has long been looked up to by talents such as 14-year-old Lois Newberry
To most of the UK, Emma Raducanu is an emerging young tennis star. But to one 14-year-old prodigious talent, she has been an inspiration for years.
Lois Newberry, an elite player in her age group who trains at the south-east London centre that Raducanu used while growing up, has looked up to the new hero of British tennis since she was a child and has practised alongside her. She said Raducanu‚Äôs recent successes at age 18 had shown her youth was no barrier to greatness.

                    <span>Absorbing, mindful and mercifully screen-free, the humble jigsaw puzzle acts as a balm in uncertain times
At some point during lockdown, perhaps in week four or week eight ‚Äì I‚Äôm not entirely sure as I‚Äôve lost all sense of time ‚Äì I started doing a 1,000-piece puzzle each day. In the morning, I‚Äôd clear the dining room table, turn the TV on to something inane and get to work sorting through a mosaic of cardboard pieces until well into the evening.
I‚Äôve always enjoyed puzzles: in preschool, I‚Äôd choose puzzles over dolls or the jungle gym, and there have been more than one New Year‚Äôs Eve spent with loved ones, tucking into bottles of wine and a puzzle as fireworks crackled overhead. But since the pandemic, I‚Äôve completed more puzzles than ever before. And I‚Äôm not alone. In households across the country, in locked-down regions, Australians are sat on the floor or at a table, rummaging through puzzle pieces, attempting to make something whole out of something disordered.

Afghanistan‚Äôs population of 38 million people risks being plunged into near-universal poverty faced with a ‚Äúcatastrophic deterioration‚Äù of the country‚Äôs heavily aid-dependent economy, according to a warning issued by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The study, which examines a series of scenarios facing the already impoverished country under the Taliban‚Äôs new hardline rule, suggests a worst-case scenario where as many as 97% of Afghans would sink below the poverty line by next year ‚Äì a staggering increase of 25%.

He does it again, he pulls it off. The figure David Cameron once called the ‚Äúgreased piglet‚Äù has slipped from the grasp of his angry party and the Tory press, all incensed by this new levy. Boris Johnson trounced them, a mere five rebels. Despite featuring only 21st in popularity in ConservativeHome‚Äôs poll of party members, he defies them all.
As long as enough of the people can be fooled enough of the time, he will go on getting away with downright fraudulent policies. Breaking promises is a peccadillo compared with a social care policy that is a sham from top to toe. But, for now, his policy flies in a miasma of aspirational promises, while facts are what he says they are.

As images and testimony circulated internationally of the arrest and brutal flogging of two reporters who were detained covering a women‚Äôs rights demonstration in Kabul on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists raised concern over the recent string of attacks.

Ikea is poised to buy Topshop‚Äôs former flagship store on London‚Äôs Oxford Street, once the jewel in Sir Philip Green‚Äôs retail empire, for an estimated ¬£385m, creating a new London home for the Swedish furniture brand.
The deal to buy the long leasehold on the building, which includes the now-vacant 100,000 sq ft Topshop outlet as well as a Nike Town store and a shop for footwear brand Vans, is expected to complete the sell off of the assets of Green‚Äôs Arcadia Group empire which collapsed into administration in November last year.

                    <span>The Conservative government is attempting to rig elections in the party‚Äôs favour with the proposed changes, say readers
The elections bill has been slipped into parliament while the nation is obsessed with care funding and the increase in national insurance contributions (Tory MPs call it reform, but the elections bill looks more like a heist, 8 September). Apart from a few Guardian articles, it has been virtually ignored by the media, the Labour party, the BBC and the rightwing press.
Yet an assault on democracy is much more important. Removing the independence of the Electoral Commission is a huge change to our constitution. Putting Michael Gove in charge of the rules for elections is mind-boggling. Introducing mandatory voter ID is unnecessary as there is no problem to fix. Changes to campaigning are aimed at constraining the Labour party and freeing up Conservative donors.

I have some sympathy with my fellow pensioners saying that they have already paid their whack. But there are two major caveats to that (Letters, 6 September).
First, contributions to the state pension in the 1960s and 70s were based on people living to their late 60s or 70s, not over 80, and didn‚Äôt cover social care ‚Äì so we have not really paid what we are now drawing. And even my workplace pension was calculated on my living to just about 80, not considerably longer.

                    <span>Drink, depression, homelessness and football injuries: the road to the director‚Äôs first feature, Sweetheart, has been difficult. She even dumped one project when her feelings about her gender identity changed
Marley Morrison has written and directed a knockout first feature ‚Äì the witty, spiky queer romance Sweetheart ‚Äì but when she rocks up to the back terrace of a London cafe, her appearance doesn‚Äôt exactly scream ‚Äúfilm-maker‚Äù. The impish 35-year-old looks more like the coolest cartoon character you ever saw: the love child of Popeye and Tank Girl. Bleached hair peeks out from beneath her pink Barbour cap; shorts and T-shirt leave her intricately cross-hatched tattoos on display. ‚ÄúMy partner‚Äôs a tattoo artist,‚Äù she explains as she sits down, ‚Äúso I‚Äôm a sketch book.‚Äù On one arm is Marlene Dietrich; on the other, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are snuggled up together in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. On her right calf is the Disney warrior Mulan, who in ancient China came to her father‚Äôs rescue by dressing as a boy. Hold that thought.
Morrison has glowering eyes, and a Lena Dunham-esque surliness that disappears the second she starts talking about the astonishing reception Sweetheart has had this year on the festival circuit. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting this,‚Äù she says, sounding dazed. ‚ÄúI just hoped it might resonate with a few people.‚Äù The picture won the audience award at the Glasgow film festival, as well as being named best first feature at the Inside Out festival in Toronto, while its star, the miraculous newcomer Nell Barlow, took home the best performance prize at Outfest in Los Angeles. Morrison herself is suddenly in demand: she has just made an ad campaign for Microsoft and will direct episodes of a new ITV2 teen drama before she moves on to her next film.

Around 1980 this book was in the window of every bookshop. I got one for Christmas when I was 13 or 14. It was my father‚Äôs selection. I remember thinking: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this?‚Äù But once I started reading, I could not stop and I became obsessed with it. It‚Äôs about human behaviour. I was just discovering my sexuality and how we relate to other human beings and this book blew my mind. I remember a section about ‚Äúdisplacement reactions‚Äù, something you do when you‚Äôre nervous or uncomfortable and you‚Äôre trying to divert the conversation elsewhere. I used to do this strange thing with my legs. I‚Äôd shake them and rub my thighs. It was very odd and friends used to comment, but through understanding it I was able to curtail my unconscious behaviour. The book changed the way I looked at everybody and I‚Äôve been fascinated by people-watching ever since. Plus there were pictures of genitalia and stuff about sex [laughs], which to this day I don‚Äôt think has ever been mentioned in my house. So as a teenager it was mesmerising.

Cristiano Ronaldo may well make his return for Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday. On the pitch or not ‚Äì every camera will be fixed on him. Every stretch. Every light jog. Every side-foot pass. Every stepover. Every perfect header.
Whether he is what Manchester United need is a different question, but for the club and the Premier League it is an incredible signing. Thirty-six years old, still breaking records, still generating the headlines, still demanding the shirt numbers.

MPs approved the government‚Äôs plan for a 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance contributions in a House of Commons vote on Wednesday, but full details of how it will operate were only published on Thursday, in a new health and social care levy bill.

It is almost exactly 10 years since Salvator Mundi was unveiled, this ‚Äúlost Leonardo‚Äù instantly triggering astonishment around the world. Since those giddy days, the work has had a turbulent time. As well as becoming the most expensive painting in history, going for $450m (¬£326m) at auction, Salvator Mundi was denounced by many as a fake and subsequently vanished from view. The painting is now the subject of The Lost Leonardo, a documentary by Andreas Koefoed that opens in cinemas this week.
‚ÄúI would be surprised,‚Äù says Luke Syson, ‚Äúif I went to see this documentary.‚Äù Syson is the curator who, back in 2011, first displayed The Saviour of the World, as its title translates, at the National Gallery‚Äôs Leonardo da Vinci blockbuster.

‚ÄòThe west has no excuse not to share vaccines‚Äô
Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

Hoarding of vaccines by wealthy western nations will result in thousands of needless deaths from Covid-19 in the world‚Äôs poorest countries every month unless urgent steps are taken to distribute jabs more fairly, Gordon Brown has said.
In an article for the Guardian, the former Labour prime minister called on the G7 rich industrial nations to hold an emergency summit in order to prevent a billion unused doses being amassed by the end of the year.

                    <span>Covid vaccine production is now so high that millions of doses risk going to waste while poorer countries struggle for supplies

Gordon Brown was UK prime minister between 2007 and 2010

Soon, the ten-billionth Covid vaccine will roll off the production lines. By January, according to a recent report from the data research agency Airfinity, a tipping point will be reached when there will be enough vaccine doses for every adult on every continent. By June the number of doses will reach 27bn, enough to fully immunise the world‚Äôs population twice over.
But despite this manufacturing triumph, we are losing badly in the arms race to actually inject every adult in every country. Next summer, on current trends, more than half the world will remain unvaccinated. We simply aren‚Äôt getting doses out to the people who need them.

Mike Padgham is the managing director of Saint Cecilia‚Äôs Care Group

Watching the government‚Äôs announcement on Tuesday of a new health and social care levy in England, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of deja vu: it was the type of damp squib moment that those of us who work in the care sector have become used to over the past 30 years.
The rise in national insurance will raise ¬£36bn in the coming three years ‚Äì but the bulk of that is going to tackle shortfalls in the NHS. Only around ¬£5.4bn is likely to find its way to social care ‚Äì a term that refers to the providers of care for elderly and disabled people. Factor in that ¬£2.5bn of that will be needed to fund the new cap on care costs, which should stop people from paying over the odds, and that just leaves ¬£2.9bn.

A museum gift shop has never been such an ideological battleground. At one end of the store in Berlin‚Äôs new Humboldt Forum is a display of souvenirs adorned with the gilded silhouette of the Stadtschloss, the city‚Äôs former royal palace, which was bombed to pieces in the second world war. Racks of silk scarves and Christmas baubles hang above rows of candles in regal colours, emblazoned with an image of the stately Prussian pile.
At the other end of the shop is a rival range of merchandise, themed around the former East German parliament and leisure centre, the Palast der Republik, which was triumphantly built on top of the ruins of the palace in the 1970s. With its sharp white marble walls, bronze-mirrored windows and space-age chandeliers, it was designed to showcase the wonders of socialism. You can buy keyrings and enamel mugs in a retro Soviet style, as well as a model kit of the building in Formo, the East German version of Lego, for ‚Ç¨250.

‚ÄúLike climbing an infinite stairway, one step at a time.‚Äù That is how Pavel Kolesnikov describes working on JS Bach‚Äôs Goldberg Variations, one of the outstanding releases of last year. On Friday 10 September, he will perform them at the penultimate night of the Proms.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had the chance to dedicate so much quality time to a piece before,‚Äù he says when we meet in a tiny cafe in central London. The city has been home since the Siberia-born Kolesnikov, now in his early 30s, came to study at the Royal College of Music. He had grown up listening to recordings of the Goldbergs by Glenn Gould and Rosalyn Tureck, but had never considered performing them himself ‚Äì ‚ÄúI did not feel I had anything to add‚Äù.

Pretty houses perching on clifftops overlooking emerald seas, a labyrinth of streets leading to a stunning old town, delectable gelato and a buzzy atmosphere as locals promenade and music plays, all combine to create a real gem. The contemporary art museum is worth a gander. It is the wandering, however, getting lost in delightful white-washed streets, stumbling across the poetry written on doorways and stairs, finding a clifftop bar beloved by locals, which is the key to enjoying this romantic town.

As usual, there‚Äôs a hidden Doctor Who reference to spot, a picture of our beloved Kate Bush, and one round that has anagrams in it just to be annoying. Have fun. There are no prizes, but let us know how you get on in the comments.

                    <span>A humanitarian crisis looms unless Americans and Europeans continue to fund the projects keeping Afghans from oblivion
Leaving is the easy bit. It‚Äôs the looking back that hurts. There was ‚Äì as Joe Biden pointed out when announcing America‚Äôs defeat at the hands of the Taliban on 31 August ‚Äì nothing ‚Äúlow-grade or low-risk or low-cost‚Äù about a 20-year deployment that cost the United States more than $1tn and thousands of service personnel their lives, their limbs or their peace of mind. But it is disingenuous to claim, as the president also did, that closing the door on Afghanistan will miraculously free the US to deal with more pressing concerns such as China and Russia.
A humanitarian crisis looms over the country, caused in part by the abrupt halting of international aid after the Taliban takeover. Even now, despite the US retreat and the announcement by the regime, on Tuesday, of an interim cabinet that gives scant representation to the country‚Äôs different ethnic groups and none at all to women or Shias, Afghanistan can‚Äôt be forgotten. Its people‚Äôs needs, and the country‚Äôs capacity to send out ripples of instability, will continue to demand attention.

                    <span>After years in US soaps, he landed the part of Armond in The White Lotus ‚Äì a ‚Äòdreamy‚Äô role that involved defecating in a suitcase. He discusses making it in middle age, coming out to his parents and losing his front teeth
It was in the middle of the pandemic that Murray Bartlett began wondering if he would ever work as an actor again. ‚ÄúI thought: ‚ÄòWhat do I do? Do I teach drama?‚Äô‚Äù He and his partner had left New York for Provincetown, Massachusetts, not long before, unsure of whether the move would jeopardise his potential roles. The virus added another note of uncertainty.
In the grip of this career crisis came the call that led to the most compelling role he has had. If any television scene can sum up the mood of our times, it is Bartlett, as the harried luxury hotel manager Armond, pooing in the suitcase of an obscenely privileged, obnoxious guest. Armond begins the six‚Äëpart series, The White Lotus, determined to do his job well, to please all the necessary people. But, as catastrophe spreads, his eyes glitter, his mood changes and it is clear propriety is about to be set aside. His descent from assured, capable, sober hotelier to rogue manager, high on drugs stolen from two teenage guests, set on sabotaging a deeply unpleasant honeymooner, is spectacular ‚Äì and probably the TV moment of the year.

                    <span>The blunt-edged, security-oriented approach allows little space to tackle the root causes of violence and find resolution

Sophie Haspeslagh is an assistant professor in political science at the American University in Cairo

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States spearheaded an international campaign to contain the threat from militant groups, like al-Qaida, by encouraging states to blacklist ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù groups. Perhaps the most significant part of this effort was the passing of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (UNSC 1373), on 28 September 2001. Twenty years later, the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan is just one example of how this heavy-handed anti-terror strategy failed.
The global blacklisting regime has not only failed to contain the Taliban but it has also made it harder to end wars across the globe. Resolution 1373 encouraged member states to set up their own blacklists to sanction the support of terror groups. But in the absence of a UN definition of what actually constitutes ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù, the resolution led to states identifying suspects in light of their own national interests. Beyond al-Qaida and the Taliban, armed groups as diverse as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the Communist Party of Nepal, the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party in Turkey, the Communist Party of the Philippines and Hamas in Palestine were listed as terrorists.

                    <span>Climate policies commit us to a calamitous 2.9C of global heating, but catastrophic changes can occur at even 1.5C or 2C
If there‚Äôs one thing we know about climate breakdown, it‚Äôs that it will not be linear, smooth or gradual. Just as one continental plate might push beneath another in sudden fits and starts, causing periodic earthquakes and tsunamis, our atmospheric systems will absorb the stress for a while, then suddenly shift. Yet, everywhere, the programmes designed to avert it are linear, smooth and gradual.
Current plans to avoid catastrophe would work in a simple system like a washbasin, in which you can close the tap until the inflow is less than the outflow. But they are less likely to work in complex systems, such as the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. Complex systems seek equilibrium. When they are pushed too far out of one equilibrium state, they can flip suddenly into another. A common property of complex systems is that it‚Äôs much easier to push them past a tipping point than to push them back. Once a transition has happened, it cannot realistically be reversed.

                    <span>I first encountered TB Joshua as a teenager, when his preaching captivated my evangelical Christian community in Hampshire. Many of my friends became his ardent disciples and followed him to Lagos. How did he have such a hold over people?

On the second day of TB Joshua‚Äôs funeral in Lagos, his disciples took to the stage. A microphone was passed around as more than 60 disciples introduced themselves by name and nationality. They came from 18 different countries, among them Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, the US and the UK. Some seemed barely out of their teens; others were in late middle age, having spent decades serving Joshua, the millionaire Nigerian pastor and self-proclaimed prophet being laid to rest. A senior Nigerian disciple, recently promoted to prophetess, began her tribute. ‚ÄúHow to describe someone so indescribable?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHow to define someone so indefinable? Human and divine?‚Äù
Joshua died on 5 June 2021, a few days before his 58th birthday. The news spread on social media, before the Synagogue, Church of All Nations, known as Scoan, made an official announcement. ‚ÄúGod has taken His servant Prophet TB Joshua home,‚Äù the statement read, ‚Äúas it should be by divine will.‚Äù Over a month later, his funeral under way, there had been no mention of a cause of death.

                    <span>Few terrorist organisations survive for more than a few years. Al-Qaida was different. Jason Burke, who has spent much of his career reporting on the group, and former member Aimen Dean reflect on how it was able to carry out the September 11 attacks more than a decade after it was formed ‚Äì and its struggle to survive the fallout from its ‚Äòcatastrophic success‚Äô
To many people, the sight of two airliners hitting the twin towers in New York prompted an immediate question: who did this? To Jason Burke and Aimen Dean, the answer was obvious. Burke had already reported extensively on the terrorist network, travelling in Afghanistan as he sought to understand its motivations and command structure. Dean knew firsthand what Osama bin Laden‚Äôs agenda was: he had met the terrorist leader twice, and trained as a bombmaker in Afghanistan before turning and becoming a spy for MI6.
In this episode, the second of three examining the reverberations of 9/11 20 years on, Michael Safi asks Burke and Dean how al-Qaida developed the capacity for an attack that would change the course of history. And they reflect on the fallout from Bin Laden‚Äôs ‚Äòcatastrophic success‚Äô, controversial even to his peers, and how the organisation survived and adapted to remain a threat after two decades.

 1.56am BST 
Next up, it‚Äôs Novak Djokovic and Matteo Berrettini for the final men‚Äôs semi-final berth. It‚Äôs a rematch of their French Open quarter-final and Wimbledon final meetings from earlier this summer, both won by the world No 1 in four sets. Here‚Äôs what Djokovic said about his Italian foe on Monday following his fourth-round win over Jenson Brooksby:
Hammer of tennis. Next to Del Potro, probably the hardest hitter of serve and forehand. He‚Äôs got the lethal-serve-plus-one game. He‚Äôs already established as a top player. Without a doubt, he played a couple of I think semi-finals here couple years ago, finals in Wimbledon. That was a tough four-setter.
Look, if he serves well, which is his biggest weapon, he‚Äôs tough. He‚Äôs tough on any surface to play against. I‚Äôve had some really close matches with him in French Open and Wimbledon recently.
 1.50am BST 
‚ÄúI trusted my serve, but now I‚Äôm going to trust it even more,‚Äù Sakkari says. And why not? The 26-year-old from Greece never faced a break point and won all but eight of the 49 points on her serve. That includes a remarkable 24 of 26 first-serve points won, a torrid 92% clip.
After having never made it past the fourth round in 20 appearances at major tournaments, Sakkari reached the French Open semis in June and has matched that showing here in Queens.

                    <span>The Italian‚Äôs mount Free Wind should start favourite, but Roger Varian‚Äôs filly is worth interest at around 11-2 at Doncaster
The Frankie effect should ensure that Free Wind sets off as favourite for the Group Two Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster on Thursday, the feature event as a big crowd returns to Town Moor for ladies‚Äô day at the St Leger meeting.
John Gosden‚Äôs filly is priced up at around 9-4 to follow up her win in a Group Three at Deauville last month, but she is just one of three progressive three-year-old fillies in the field and certainly not as far ahead of them as her odds might suggest.

In a scathing open letter to Boris Johnson, first reported in the Daily Mail, the panel of influential individuals said that after ‚Äúdecades of equivocation and inertia‚Äù, the Met must be held accountable for its failings and Dick should not be handed the two-year extension to her term in office, which she was offered on Wednesday.

                    <span>Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London
Beyond the visual thrills and powerful ballads, this adaptation brings an unexpected depth to the relationship between two tortured sisters 

This musical extravaganza about estranged sisters, an icy kingdom and unharnessed supernatural powers arrives in the West End from Broadway as part of a plan to stage five Frozens around the world this year. As canny as that seems commercially, a mega-successful animation does not always translate into a stage hit, even with Disney money thrown at it.
The 2013 film was met with acclaim, Oscars and delirium. Does this adaptation live up to that hefty legacy? Yes, and perhaps it even exceeds it. This is a show every bit as magical as the animation, packed with visual thrills and gorgeous choreography (by Rob Ashford) alongside signature ballads that gain greater power in their live incarnation. It is big on spectacle yet never loses control with special effects that yield some dazzling coups de theatre.

Grenfell: The Untold Story (Channel 4) is a beautiful film about the most awful of subjects. The simple tragedy of 70 people dying in one night ‚Äì two more thereafter ‚Äì when a tower block caught fire is terrible enough. The story of how and why it became the inferno it did, capable of unleashing such devastation, is presented as one of such moral failure and ugliness that if you hadn‚Äôt witnessed it unfold you would half-believe it was a fable for our times.
But we did witness it. First in the headlines and the contemporary footage of the fire itself as ‚Äì in the early hours of the morning of 14 June 2017 ‚Äì it spread rapidly from a fridge in a fourth-floor flat up the outside of the recently refurbished 1970s block in west London. Then in the reports of the deaths ‚Äì including 18 children, a quarter of all the young people who had lived in the tower. And then in the Grenfell inquiry, which confirmed that it was the exterior cladding, changed from the proposed type to a cheaper, more flammable kind that enabled the rapid spread of the flames and the production of toxic gases (which spread easily due to a lack of fire doors fit for purpose) ‚Äì without which, one must presume, the death toll would have been lower.

It was time for Kane to take matters into his own hands. The ball was worked to him at the top of the midfield and, with little on and Poland players backing off rather too respectfully, Kane unloaded with murderous intent.

                    <span>Forty years on from John Carpenter‚Äôs classic slasher film, David Gordon Green‚Äôs latest reanimation of the title is functional but enjoyable
It‚Äôs Halloween 2018 in Haddonfield, Illinois, and the time-honoured festivities are in full swing. At the start of the second episode of the revived franchise there‚Äôs already a body impaled on railings, and a cop (Will Patton) gushing blood on the ground. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) ‚Äì horror cinema‚Äôs original Final Girl, now Final Grandmother ‚Äì is being rushed to hospital, and her house is in flames. But indestructible killer Michael Myers has decided to make a night of it, and is out there armed with a firefighter‚Äôs axe, axing firefighters.
Forty years after John Carpenter made the defining slasher movie, director David Gordon Green has made a creditable stab, as it were, at reanimating the title. Green is an occasional indie auteur (George Washington, Prince Avalanche) who leads a double life as a mainstream stalwart, and showed in his 2018 Halloween reboot that he‚Äôs more than competent at straight genre thrills. Writing again with Danny McBride, here joined by Scott Teems, Green offers a functional but enjoyably efficient follow-up. It kicks in only minutes after the events of the previous episode, and pretty much follows a straight line, apart from brief flashbacks to 1978, with even a passable Donald Pleasence lookalike on hand to lend authenticity.

                    <span>Bromley teenager was meant to have met her match in Belinda Bencic but she dismantled the Swiss in a masterclass
Less than 10 minutes after Emma Raducanu emerged from the tunnel into Arthur Ashe Stadium for the biggest match of her life against the highest-calibre opponent she had ever faced, the emerging British star was promptly broken in her opening service game.
This is where the fairytale was meant to end: opposite the in-form Belinda Bencic, the newly minted Olympic gold medallist who had lost only once in her last 14 matches, whose class and experience would surely be too much for a teenager ranked 150th in the world.

In the first decree issued by the hardline Islamist group‚Äôs new interior ministry, which is led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is wanted by the United States on terrorism charges, the Taliban warned opponents that they must secure permission before any protests or face ‚Äúsevere legal consequences‚Äô‚Äù.

News:  ‚ÄòMind-bending‚Äô Piranesi wins Women‚Äôs prize
This year‚Äôs Women‚Äôs prize produced a notably strong shortlist, led by Brit Bennett‚Äôs landmark saga of racism and family in the US, The Vanishing Half; along with Patricia Lockwood‚Äôs hilariously barbed satire of internet domination, No One is Talking About This, and Yaa Gyasi‚Äôs thoughtful exploration of science, faith and generational trauma, Transcendent Kingdom. It also spotlit Claire Fuller‚Äôs quietly brilliant portrayal of English outsiders, Unsettled Ground, and a searing Barbadian debut, How the One-Armed Sister Sweeps Her House by Cherie Jones.
But it‚Äôs a delight to see the award go to Susanna Clarke‚Äôs triumphantly unusual second novel Piranesi, which begins as the diary of a man trapped in a vast mysterious mansion, in which an ocean rises and falls. He is dreamily content there, with birds, statues and his own scribblings for company, believing himself alone in the world except for visits from a well-dressed Other, who brings vitamin pills and appears to be studying him.

Comment: Piranesi is a triumphantly unusual winner
Susanna Clarke, who published her debut novel Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell 17 years ago and then was struck down with chronic illness, has won the Women‚Äôs prize for fiction for her second, Piranesi.
Narrated by its eponymous hero as he explores the endless halls of a house that imprisons an ocean, Piranesi is ‚Äúa truly original, unexpected flight of fancy which melds genres and challenges preconceptions about what books should be,‚Äù according to the Women‚Äôs prize chair of judges, Booker-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo.

Single father Anthony Lynam told the work and pensions select committee that the ¬£20 uplift, introduced in 2020, had been a relief after having to choose between feeding his kids or switching the heating on, and relying on the local church food bank.

                    <span>The 1.25-point rise in tax on dividend income will hit sole traders and the self-employed    
The lower-profile element in the government‚Äôs tax hike to raise cash for health and social care was the 1.25% percentage point increase in tax on dividend income. It didn‚Äôt generate the same attention as the core revenue-raising ‚Äúsocial care levy‚Äù on national insurance contributions because, first, the sums are smaller, and, second, because wealthy individuals enjoying dividend income from vast share portfolios are viewed as fair game.
But therein lies the political cynicism in the measure. While some fortunate folk do indeed fit the dividend-happy caricature, not many will be touched by this measure. Those at the top of the bracket long ago moved their holdings offshore. And the comfortable class of private investor knows the first rule of the game: utilise your annual tax-free Isa allowance (currently ¬£20,000).

There can be benefits to being a serial liar. While politicians with a reputation for honesty can find their careers ended by one broken promise, those, like Boris Johnson, for whom the truth is by and large an unknown country, can skate by unscathed. Simply because no one expects him to keep his word. His relationships with family, friends and voters are entirely transactional. They get to hear what they want: he gets to bend reality to whatever serves him best at any given time.
One of the great illusions is that so many mistake his constant shape-shifting as a sign of self-confidence. It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a sign of someone with no self-worth. Someone who can‚Äôt face reality. Though that has never held Boris back.

For all that Emma Raducanu has achieved and how far she has come over only a few fleeting weeks as a full-time professional, one of the opportunities she was still waiting for was the chance to battle against a top player. Until she stepped on to Arthur Ashe Stadium, she had never faced a top-40 opponent or tested her strengths against the best.
When the time came against one of the most in-form players on the tour, the Olympic champion, she surveyed the threat across the net and simply stepped up another level.

In Brexit negotiations, no deadline is final. Reliably, it is the UK that needs an extension. Just as consistently, the reason is failure to understand the implications of something that had been agreed before the last deadline.
In accordance with that pattern, the government this week once again extended ‚Äúgrace periods‚Äù waiving checks for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. An early March deadline had been unilaterally abandoned by the UK; a second date of October was agreed with the European Commission. Now, David Frost, Brexit minister, says the waiver is to be indefinite ‚Äúto provide space for potential further discussions‚Äù on changes to the Northern Ireland protocol.

As ever, George Monbiot hits the nail on the head with his article emphasising the need to reduce building, especially roads that just exacerbate climate degradation (We can‚Äôt build our way out of the environmental crisis, 1 September). In particular, we all need to use less of everything and adopt the lifestyle mantra that ‚Äúless is more‚Äù.
This is essential to reverse the vast number of lifestyle items that we have been persuaded to adopt over the past 20-30 years. These range from water sold to us in plastic bottles, to the ‚Äúneed‚Äù to travel further, faster, and in greater comfort. With a small amount of willpower, it is quite easy to adopt a slower, less carbon-intensive and more rewarding lifestyle. It remains an uphill struggle to convince others to follow suit and help bring about the ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù needed to avoid further climate catastrophes.

                    <span>The far-right president has never hidden his admiration for dictatorship. There are growing fears he will not accept defeat in next year‚Äôs election
Though Jair Bolsonaro‚Äôs opponents warned of the dangers, most voters in the world‚Äôs fourth largest democracy were willing to elect a declared admirer of dictatorship. Many are now having second thoughts. The president‚Äôs popularity has plummeted, with almost two-thirds of Brazilians now rejecting him. Even those unfazed by the relentlessness of his aggressive ultra-conservatism have balked at a supreme court investigation into his own conduct and corruption allegations surrounding his allies and family, surging inflation and unemployment, and above all his decision to let Covid run rampant, killing more than 580,000 Brazilians.
But those who backed him are getting what they voted for: a man with unabashed disdain for democracy and admiration for force. On current polling, the popular though polarising former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva would beat him easily in 2022‚Äôs election. Mr Bolsonaro is acting accordingly. The president has already sought to cast doubt on electronic voting, and limited the power of tech companies to remove content ‚Äì making it harder to tackle disinformation. On Tuesday, he unleashed rallies in the country‚Äôs biggest cities, Rio de Janeiro, Bras√≠lia and S√£o Paulo. Though not quite on the scale he hoped for, the crowds were still sufficiently large and fervid to send his message. If the supreme court does not shift its course, ‚Äúit may suffer that which we don‚Äôt want‚Äù, Mr Bolsonaro warned. Diehard supporters had a less euphemistic version of how to handle his opponents: ‚ÄúShut down the court,‚Äù and ‚ÄúShoot them‚Äù.

A man has been given a 14-week suspended sentence and must wear an electronic tag for 40 weeks over a racist comment directed towards black England footballers after the team‚Äôs defeat in the Euro 2020 final in July.
Scott McCluskey, 43, posted a status update on his Facebook profile shortly after England lost to Italy on 11 July, Warrington magistrates court heard. He blamed ‚Äúthree ethnic players‚Äù for the defeat and then used a racial slur calling for them to be sacked.

Priti Patel has met with the French interior minister, G√©rald Darmanin, after a tense exchange between the two countries over the number of migrants crossing the Channel to the UK.
The talks broke up on Wednesday afternoon and followed an influx of small boats during warm weather this week, increasing pressure on the home secretary from Downing Street and other members of her party.

My Covid-19 research team is also experiencing serious problems. Recently, our results questioned the clinical benefits of a drug called ivermectin. Anti-vaxxers claim that this drug is effective, and so can be used as an alternative to vaccines. However, several of the clinical trials suggesting benefits appear to be fraudulent. There is no evidence for clinical benefits when only high quality clinical trials are included.

                    <span>Public attitudes to spending have shifted since austerity, yet the opposition seems to be championing low taxes
For decades, many on the left have hankered for the social democratic political settlement of other European countries. Britain, it has been said, should ditch Thatcherism once and for all, and embrace higher taxes as the means of improving public services.
Now it has happened. As a result of the new health and social care levy, taxation will rise to its highest sustained level on record. This is the work not of a party of the left but of one of the right. Rishi Sunak may say he is a fiscal hawk who favours a small state and low taxes, but he is a tax-and-spend chancellor. Sajid Javid may have a picture of the Iron Lady on his office wall, but he is a tax-and-spend health secretary.

                    <span>Taxing wealth and scrapping the upper earnings limit on national insurance would address generational inequality

Alfie Stirling is head of economics at the New Economics Foundation

Tuesday‚Äôs announcements on national insurance contributions (NICs) will see working age adults pay disproportionately for what is overwhelmingly pension-age care. Buried on the same day was the news that departments are being asked to plan 5% cuts to ‚Äúnon-priority‚Äù services each year until 2024. Within just weeks the furlough scheme is set to be dissolved, with an estimated 1.9 million staff still being supported at the latest count. And by October, 5m households relying on universal credit will face the deepest overnight cut to welfare in UK history. It‚Äôs a cruel start to the government‚Äôs new parliamentary term. Expect the phrase ‚ÄúBrexit dividend‚Äù to keep a low profile this autumn.
The latest reforms have provoked a sense of unfairness around the treatment of generational wealth and income. In today‚Äôs Britain, how you make your money matters. If you rely on earnings for a living, the government has asked that you contribute an extra 2.5% of your wages towards the costs of social care ‚Äì ultimately the 1.25 percentage point increase to both employee and employer NICs will each come out of workers‚Äô take-home pay. If you‚Äôre paid in dividends, you‚Äôve been asked to contribute an extra 1.25% of your wages. But if you take your income in interest, rent, capital gains or pension annuity you‚Äôre effectively exempt from the new levy.

                    <span>Food banks and volunteers have put into practice the universalist principle that once underpinned the welfare state
When Slung Low theatre in Leeds closed during the first lockdown in March last year, its five core staff decided to stay put. The publicly funded theatre had cash and a van, so the staff leafleted the theatre‚Äôs neighbourhood in Holbeck, an impoverished area in south Leeds, offering to help with everyday tasks that had suddenly become impossible for many people. Requests piled in for grocery shopping, dog-walking and prescription pick-ups. As workplaces closed, people started asking for food support. Before long, the local council approached Slung Low, which normally stages large-scale theatre shows in castles and town centres, to organise a food bank for a ward of 7,500 residents. So it did, supplying around 15,000 deliveries over 15 months: thousands of eggs, cereal boxes, tins of beans and pints of milk.
Slung Low‚Äôs food bank was, like its theatre performances, a large-scale production. But it was by no means the only initiative of its kind to emerge during the pandemic. Over the past 18 months, 4,000 mutual aid groups formed across the country, staffed by millions of volunteers, who patched together safety nets for those in need. Whether delivering food, helping elderly people or supporting those with deteriorating mental health, many mutual aiders fast realised that help is a two-way street. For some, it provided an immediate way to practise political values. Other volunteers I spoke with said it offered them meaning and purpose in a way that actual, paid work did not.

                    <span>England‚Äôs international tonight inevitably brings to mind two uncomfortable hours of broadcasting with Gareth Southgate, Lee Dixon and Roy Keane
Tonight, England play Poland in Warsaw, the first time they have played them there since October 2012. That was a night that reoccurs in my dreams and nightmares, as well as those of three ex-footballers and several television producers.
I was presenting ITV‚Äôs coverage. Gareth Southgate, along with two other eminent former footballers, Lee Dixon and Roy Keane, were our match analysts.

The vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned today by countries and companies must remain in the ground if the climate crisis is to be ended, an analysis has found.
The research found 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas reserves could not be extracted if there was to be even a 50% chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C, the temperature beyond which the worst climate impacts hit.

The event at the town hall of Gangelt, a municipality on the border with the Netherlands, was labelled ‚ÄúGermany‚Äôs Wuhan‚Äù after it was found to be the driver of a major outbreak in the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia last year.

Gavin Williamson has been branded the most ignorant and incapable education secretary in the UK‚Äôs history after he appeared to confuse Marcus Rashford with the England rugby player Maro Itoje, who is also black.
The cabinet minister, who is widely tipped for demotion at a long-awaited reshuffle some Westminster insiders think could take place on Thursday, made the apparent gaffe in an interview with the Evening Standard.

For those who have retired, the reforms will mean a temporary suspension of the triple lock which ensures state pensions rise annually by the highest of inflation, 2.5% or the average wage increase.

My gardener, Emmanuel, returned a few days ago after a five-month hiatus. One of the conditions for his return was that he needed to be vaccinated. He comes from Karamoja in the north-eastern part of Uganda, where the vaccine uptake was low, so he was able to get vaccinated.
I first thought that he was fibbing, as many Ugandans are prone to do when they get fake documents in order to get a pass. I checked his card and confirmed he had a genuine vaccination card. He told me that his whole family had been vaccinated.

The new frontrunner to win Germany‚Äôs national vote at the end of this month says he believes he can reawaken Europe‚Äôs centre-left from its decade-long slumber with a two-fold promise: to guarantee his country‚Äôs continued economic success, while at the same time putting an end to the myth that individual success is always self-made.
Germany‚Äôs vice-chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has this summer surprisingly lifted his Social Democratic party (SPD) above Angela Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in opinion polls, in large part due to a reputation for rational decision-making and fiscal prudence that mirrors that of the outgoing chancellor.

It‚Äôs difficult to describe the feelings of jubilation, guilt, disbelief, confusion, gratitude and fear that came with the news that Shakespeare‚Äôs Globe would reopen and that I would be playing Flute in A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, then Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth Night, then both concurrently. I couldn‚Äôt stop thanking God or panicking.
I‚Äôd had 15 months of uncertainty to prepare myself mentally, and when I finally drew into Blackfriars station on the Thames and saw the iconic thatched wooden ‚ÄúO‚Äù of the Globe sitting on the riverbank, living, as it had, in my dreams for over a year, I started hyperventilating the second I alighted. I regained composure long enough to wave some masked hellos to the strangers I would be spending the next six months with, then lost it all again when we made our introductions on stage. I have an occasional stammer that hasn‚Äôt really troubled me since my mid-20s. It came blazing back the second I tried to say ‚ÄúFouracres‚Äù and ‚Äúplaying‚Äù, then us brand-newbies were introduced to the building.

I was asleep when the first plane hit. At the time, I lived just four blocks from the World Trade Center, right next to a hospital, a fire station and the HQ of the New York police. The sirens woke me up. They were nonstop. I turned on the television and saw one of the towers on fire. As I watched the second plane hit the south tower on TV, I also heard it because I lived so close.
I was working for Associated Press (AP) as a photo editor. I knew, as their closest staff member, that I should go out and document it. I got dressed, threw some film into my camera bag, and ran out to the World Trade Center. A lot of photography is like muscle memory. Even in a situation like this, your body knows exactly what to do. I remember a cop asking me: ‚ÄúHow can you take photographs?‚Äù I told him: ‚ÄúI have to document this. It‚Äôs history.‚Äù

                    <span>Once seemingly a fast track to cancellation, TV shows are again dancing around the censors with almost-curse words in their titles. But do they still make viewers go WTF?
When Eugene and Dan Levy were first pitching their idea for a comedy about a wealthy family who go broke, there was one major stumbling block: the name. When several channels asked them to change the title from Schitt‚Äôs Creek to something less vulgar, the Levys doubled down. They pulled out pages from a phone directory to prove that there were actual people with the sweary surname. ‚ÄúIf CBC was doing a news broadcast with the name Schitt, would you not use it?‚Äù, Eugene Levy told the Toronto Star. ‚ÄúThey said: ‚ÄòYes, we would air the name.‚Äô‚Äù After throwing it at the network‚Äôs wall, they finally got Schitt to stick.
But when it aired in 2015, the series was not without its issues. NPR had to spell out the word when talking about it; some channels, such as CBS, had to flash up what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúthe lower third‚Äù ‚Äì subtitles literally spelling it out ‚Äì every time they mentioned it on air. Some TV and radio stations were reduced to simply calling it ‚ÄúCreek‚Äù, presumably confusing both Dawson‚Äôs Creek and Jonathan Creek fans in the process.

                    <span>This characteristically Southern belle of a dish can be made in many ways, but which version is the cream of the crop?
Corn in this country has two distinct seasons: tuna-and-sweetcorn sandwich season, which runs from October to July, and the current barbecued corn on the cob season, in which we choose to floss our gums on something that is somehow simultaneously hotter than the sun and almost completely raw. Our lack of expertise is perhaps understandable, since the maize family is native to the Americas, and gained popularity as human food in this country only relatively recently.
Not for us the myriad celebratory festivals that pepper the American Midwest in summer, many of which culminate in the crowning of a sweetcorn queen ‚Äì though I must draw your attention to the Isle of Wight‚Äôs Sweetcorn Fayre at the end of September, which promises visitors a giant sweetcorn fritter ‚Äì nor the many different ways to enjoy it, from chowder to succotash. Perhaps my favourite, however, is this particularly Southern take, available year round in a tin but, in my opinion, only really worth eating fresh.

                    <span>Gideon Mendel has been photographing people returning home after the devastation of recent wildfires on the island of Evia in Greece. The work follows his earlier projects about people affected by wildfires in New South Wales, Australia, and flooding globally
At the end of August, as part of my long-term work on the global climate emergency, I travelled to Evia in Greece to explore the impacts of the unprecedented fires that had devastated village communities and the ecology of the island. I chose not to chase the drama of the burning flames, but rather to seek out their aftermath. I encountered endless blackened landscapes and made these portraits of people whose lives have been destroyed by the fire they describe as a ‚Äúburning hell‚Äù. I know that it was not easy for my subjects to return to their homes to be photographed, and for some this was the first time that they had stepped inside since the fire. However, I found that they embraced this moment of having their fractured situation witnessed and were keen to share their stories. I was moved by their openness to my camera after all the horrors of their recent experience. Visually I found that an eerily precise symmetry seemed to emerge from the unspeakable chaos of their ruined homes, many of which are situated in places of profound beauty. I hope that their gaze at the camera will provoke a visceral sense of the climate threat we all face.

                    <span>Rupali Sharma of the Lawyering Project explains how SB8 lawsuits could damage the careers and lives of abortion providers and patients
Last week, the most severe abortion restriction in the country became law in Texas. SB8 is a six-week abortion ban, which amounts to more or less an outright ban, since many people don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre pregnant until after the six-week mark. Abortion clinics in the state have estimated that the law bans somewhere between 85% and 90% of the procedures they provide.
But perhaps the most shocking part of the law is how it‚Äôs enforced: SB8 is enforced not by the state attorney general or other government officials, but by private citizens, who are encouraged to snitch on people who violate the abortion ban by filing civil lawsuits against them. (And they are promised a minimum of $10,000 in ‚Äúdamages‚Äù if they win the suit ‚Äì what abortion rights supporters are calling a ‚Äúbounty‚Äù.) The threat of litigation and financial ruin has forced clinics across the state to comply with the law, even though its core principle ‚Äì banning abortion ‚Äì is still unconstitutional.

Michael Grandage‚Äôs film My Policeman, which has just finished filming in Brighton, tells the story of a married couple in a loving and enduring menage a trois. The third party is the husband‚Äôs male lover.
The adaptation of Bethan Roberts‚Äô novel covers a period in recent English history ‚Äì stretching from the 1950s to the 90s ‚Äì when attitudes to homosexuality underwent significant change. What was once illegal, and supposedly scorned by right-thinking members of society, became accepted to the extent that, in 2014, same-sex marriage was recognised in law.

More than 100 former students at a troubled London academy have published an open letter to its governors, Ofsted and the government alleging a catalogue of serious failings in pastoral care and safeguarding of pupils, including ‚Äúoff-rolling‚Äù of some students and failure to act appropriately in peer-on-peer sexual assault.
The letter from former students at Holland Park school, which is judged ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù by Ofsted and boasts the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and former Commons speaker John Bercow among parents, comes only a month after the Guardian revealed that an independent inquiry into alleged bullying and intimidation of staff, and the withholding of staff questionnaires from school inspectors, had been commissioned by the governing body.

But after she began live-streaming her journey and her struggles, she became a Chinese internet sensation with online fans sending her donations to fund her new life. Su has become an accidental feminist icon, inspiring other women to leave behind restrictive gender expectations for a life of adventure.

Breaking an explicit manifesto promise, the levy will mean a 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions. Employers and directors of small companies will also pay an additional 1.25% tax on dividends for employees earning about the class 1 secondary threshold.

Days after giving birth to her first child ‚Äì an emergency caesarean after the cord had wrapped itself around the baby‚Äôs neck ‚Äì Kareena Kapoor Khan stood undressed and alone in front of a mirror in her bedroom. ‚ÄúThere I was: scarred, chubby, puffy, tired,‚Äù she recalls of that moment in 2016. ‚ÄúI saw the baby bulge, the dark circles, the dressing bandage of my C-incision. I cannot describe how I felt.‚Äù
The image is stark; after all, if there is such a thing as Bollywood royalty, Kapoor Khan is it. The daughter of Bollywood legends, often described as among the most glamorous women in Bollywood, she is married to one of the leading actors of Hindi cinema and over two decades has become one of India‚Äôs most bankable stars.
Nonetheless, 20 years in the limelight has not stopped Kapoor Khan being open about parts of her life that most celebrities keep hidden. This has always set her apart in Bollywood and it is this approach that she has brought to her most recent project.

I held them in awe. My supervisors at Newnham College, Cambridge, in the 50s were of the generation who had served in the war: Bletchley Park, the Board of Trade, that kind of thing. They were fiercely intelligent in a way my schoolteachers had not been. I was brimming with admiration and fear. It was why I had studied hard to be there, to pit my wit against the finest in the land. But I was to come a cropper severely. In the end, it served me well enough. But the pain remains.
I had studied economics in my first year. My supervisor was Ruth Cohen, who sat on the floor in dishevelled tweeds, her legs wide and an ashtray between, to catch the ash from her continual smoking. Needless to say, she was brilliant. Soon she would be made college principal, take herself off for a makeover and emerge, neat, tidy, almost smart, to lead the college with style.

                    <span>The past 18 months have left many parents and carers feeling overwhelmed, irritable and wrung bone dry. Can balance ever be restored?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of how blurred the lines are between home and work,‚Äù Julia Thomas tells me as her two boys repeatedly ask for snacks in the background. Thomas lives in London with her husband, twin 11-year-old boys and a daughter, seven. She is a civil servant, but says she is feeling so burned out by childcare that she‚Äôs considering quitting her job completely. She isn‚Äôt sleeping properly, her back and hips ache from sitting at a desk all day and her constant to-do list makes life feel chaotic.
‚ÄúQuitting my job feels like a big deal. I feel guilty, as if I‚Äôm letting the sisterhood down ‚Äì but this situation is untenable,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe children are downstairs, while my husband and I are upstairs on Zoom meetings. We can still hear the sibling fights, even when we‚Äôre working, and when it gets bad they bring the problem to you.‚Äù

Marks &amp; Spencer‚Äôs showcase of new autumn looks is both a back-to-school moment in the British fashion industry calendar and a bellwether of which catwalk trends will successfully translate to the mass market.
But this season‚Äôs hero pieces are not designer-lookalikes in the vein of 2013‚Äôs sellout pink coat, or celebrity favourites such as 2015‚Äôs as-seen-on Alexa Chung suede skirt. In 2021, the stars of the show are colourful tracksuits, quilted coats and non-wired bras.

The 20th anniversary of 9/11 and its fallout was always going to be a moment of deep soul searching about what has been lost and learned.
But the retrospective, until a few weeks ago, risked having a historical, even sepia, quality as the attention of political leaders moved to a more contemporary set of threats ‚Äì health pandemics, climate emergencies, Big Tech and great power competition, including the rise of China. The ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù, after all, looked if not won, at least drawn. It was even possible Islamist terrorism was a temporary manageable phenomenon, increasingly confined to Africa and some lethal loners in European shopping centres.

In the first of three episodes examining the reverberations of the attacks 20 years on, three of that group reflect on the weight of that private grief ‚Äì and what it meant to grow up with it in the media spotlight
Mike and Dan Friedman were 11 years old when their father, Andrew, died on 9/11. Robyn Higley, whose father Robert also died in the attacks, was yet to be born.
The loss they suffered is unimaginable to most of us ‚Äì but they are part of a group of 3,051 children who lost a parent, 105 of them when they were still in the womb. Ahead of the 20th anniversary of the attacks, in the first of three episodes examining the consequences and reverberations of that day, Robyn, Mike and Dan describe what it was like to grow up with their private grief so inextricably tied to a seismic global tragedy. And Ed Pilkington, the chief reporter for Guardian US, tells Michael Safi about the meaning of the anniversary to the bereaved, and how tokens their parents left behind and their pride in dealing with the loss has helped sustain them in the two decades since.

Seventeen patients, most of them suffering from Covid-19, have died after a hospital in central Mexico flooded when torrential rain caused a river to burst its banks.
More than 40 other patients in the public hospital in the town of Tula in Hidalgo state were evacuated by emergency service workers on Tuesday, and an initial assessment showed about 2,000 houses had flood damage, the Mexican government said in a statement.

Kono has used his platform on Twitter ‚Äì where his Japanese account has nearly 2.4 million followers and his English-language one nearly 50,000 ‚Äì to berate civil servants for working into the wee hours and holding late-night press conferences.

First, it was North Korea. Then, came Myanmar. Now, it is Afghanistan. The three ongoing crises in China‚Äôs neighbourhood seem to have little in common. But for Beijing, they pose the same question: how to deal with strategically important yet failing states on its border, and how will China‚Äôs response define its identity as a global power.
For many years, China watchers in the west have been looking for clues to how a rising power will exercise its influence on the world stage through its involvement in Africa or its relations with the US. But the way China approaches the three neighbouring countries may provide a clearer picture.

The Boundary Commission for Wales admitted that the proposed changes, announced on Wednesday, were significant‚Äù but said the decision of the UK parliament to reduce the number of Welsh MPs in Westminster from 40 to 32 had meant it had to re-draw the map for all but one of the nation‚Äôs constituencies.

The defender could do nothing about it, the ball having been blasted against him by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who had put Serbia into the lead in the first half.
Debate swirled before the game about what the repercussions of another defeat might be for Kenny. The manager insisted he was engaged in a development strategy whose fruits might not ripen until Euro 2024 but a couple of local reports suggested the patience of at least some officials at the Football Association of Ireland was wearing thin. The public is split between fans who claim Kenny‚Äôs methods will never work and those who maintain he deserves more time to implement a daring revolution in a country reaping the consequences of years of chronic neglect by the FAI.

The Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow should be postponed until the government can ensure that the talks won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúrich nations stitch-up‚Äù, a diverse coalition of international organisations has said.
With less than two months to go before the talks, the Climate Action Network (CAN), a global alliance of more than 1,500 civil society organisations, is warning that many delegates from the global south will be unable to attend due to vaccine inequity and prohibitive quarantine costs.

Mexico‚Äôs supreme court has struck down a state abortion law, ruling that criminal penalties for terminating pregnancies are unconstitutional, in a decision which advocates say provides a path to decriminalisation across the country.
In a unanimous 10-0 ruling, the top court ordered the northern state of Coahuila to remove sanctions for abortion from its criminal code ‚Äì with several justices arguing the prohibitions on voluntarily interrupting a pregnancy violated women‚Äôs rights to control their own bodies.

                    <span>Tim Blake Nelson has a blast as a pig farmer with something to hide, but this low-aiming western is as familiar as refried beans

Old Henry premieres at the Sala Grande here at Venice, with the sea at its front and the gondolas at its back and it‚Äôs hard to imagine a less appropriate setting. Potsy Ponciroli‚Äôs film is a rootin‚Äô tootin‚Äô barrel of wild-west cliches, complete with bank robbers, a scared kid and a dastardly villain who wears a black hat. The programmers could at least have played ball and put some saloon doors at the entrance, sawdust on the floor, maybe a spittoon by each seat.
Tim Blake Nelson grabs a rare and deserved title role as Henry, an ornery old pig farmer who may (slight spoiler) be a stone-cold cowboy killer in flight from a past he‚Äôd rather not talk about, dagnammit. Even so, Henry‚Äôs currently doing fine. He has a meek teenage son, Wyatt (Gavin Lewis) and a mess of hogs out the back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt it ever bother you sometimes that they eat their own?‚Äù asks Wyatt, but this doesn‚Äôt worry Henry, who surely saw far worse things occur during the bad old life that he may or may not have lived in the past.

The prime minister, once again, had to level with us. Flanked by his chancellor and health secretary, he kicked off with some truth bombs. NHS waiting lists would get worse before they got better. Social care wouldn‚Äôt improve without more money, and that money must come from tax.
It couldn‚Äôt come from more borrowing, he implored. Rishi Sunak chimed in later to deepen the point: debt was irresponsible and dishonest. Sajid Javid couldn‚Äôt have agreed more strongly. What was the point in hearing from all three of them, one might wonder, when they were all of exactly the same mind while making a very simple point, like Newsround-does-tax?

Three individuals, wearing sharp suits and armed with guns, robbed the recently revamped boutique on the Place Vend√¥me in central Paris, where the Ritz hotel is located, shortly before midday on Tuesday, police said.

                    <span>The boost to health and care spending is needed, but troubling details, and unfairness, remain
In 2019, in his first speech as prime minister, Boris Johnson promised to fix the crisis in social care ‚Äúonce and for all‚Äù. Two years later, a plan has arrived as part of a mishmash announcement that also tries to address the enormous problem of demand facing the NHS, and rising anger about intergenerational unfairness. The best part of Tuesday‚Äôs news is the money: around ¬£12bn a year to be shared between health and social care for each of the next three years. This is likely to be a broadly popular measure; polls show that the public is willing to stump up taxes to pay for a better service. And the NHS desperately needs it, with waiting lists at their highest ever levels in England.
To achieve this, the prime minister has calculated that his MPs, and voters, will swallow the pill of broken manifesto promises. This includes the announcement that the pensions triple lock will be removed next year, as well as the 1.25% rise in national insurance contributions plus 1.25% from employers that (along with a tax on dividends) is the mechanism chosen to deliver new funding. With the proposed cut to universal credit, 2.5 million working families will shell out ¬£1,300 a year. From 2023-24 when government systems have been updated, payslips will show a ‚Äúhealth and care levy‚Äù, including those of workers over the state pension age (who until now have been exempt from NI). By branding the portion of the new money that will be channelled to the devolved administrations a ‚Äúunion dividend‚Äù, the government hopes to bind them to the UK.

                    <span>A government proposal to ease restrictions on the sale of imported cultural works risks harming a world-class industry
The hoopla around the release of Sally Rooney‚Äôs new novel on Tuesday ‚Äì with bookshops opening early, and queues of shoppers eager to lay their hands on Beautiful World, Where Are You ‚Äì has contributed to the image of a publishing industry in rude health. Last year had the highest sales in eight years. Yet authors, bricks-and-mortar bookshops and publishers alike fear that the industry faces a powerful new threat, if cheap editions legitimately produced for an overseas market are allowed to be sold in the UK. Kazuo Ishiguro, Bernardine Evaristo and others have warned that the effect on writers would be devastating.
EU regulations meant that UK producers could prevent the importation of such books into Britain; in the wake of Brexit, the government is considering reversing this. A report proposes to change how we deal with the exhaustion of intellectual property rights. The document, from a taskforce headed by Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and George Freeman, argues that, apart from limited exceptions, ‚Äúin general, protectionist use of IP rights should be resisted‚Äù. It suggests that we liberalise parallel import laws ‚Äúto reduce prices and increase choice for consumers‚Äù (in notes from a familiar Tory hymn sheet). This would mean that a non-UK publisher, say, that has legitimately bought the rights to publish Harry Potter, could then sell those books back into Britain. Where they are cheaper, reflecting lower costs and consumer incomes in those markets, the original producers would be at a disadvantage.

Old Trafford was deemed to be the less comfortable of the two biosecure venues by England‚Äôs men last summer, with its city location and smaller perimeter a distant second to the leafy golf resort that is the Ageas Bowl. Some even called it an ‚Äúopen prison‚Äù.
But cricket-wise the old ground was also the scene of the three Test wins they managed to secure during that weird season ‚Äì two against West Indies, one against Pakistan ‚Äì and thus a source of encouragement as Joe Root‚Äôs now weary-looking side hope to beat India in Friday‚Äôs fifth Test and escape with a drawn series.

That‚Äôs a relief ‚Äì especially for Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. TransDigm, by a distance the more problematic of the two bidders for Meggitt, the Coventry-based maker of components for commercial and military aircraft, is out of the race. The Ohio-based firm yanked its ¬£7bn proposal on Tuesday and grumbled about ‚Äúthe quite limited due diligence information‚Äù that Meggitt made available.
You got the same data as Parker-Hannifin, the other contender, Meggitt quickly replied, giving a hint of the tensions behind the scenes. One speculative reading of that sub-plot is that TransDigm, already borrowed up to the eyeballs by conventional yardsticks, required every last financial detail to make its lenders comfortable.

A coroner has raised concerns that only two paramedics were on duty for a cage fight at which a mixed martial arts enthusiast suffered fatal head injuries.
The coroner, Christopher Wilkinson, said it was ‚Äúregrettable‚Äù that Saeideh Aletaha, a 26-year-old engineer, was left alone after she was knocked out because the paramedics had to hurry back to ringside for other bouts.

Andy Cowper writes a weekly column for Health Policy Insight

Boris Johnson today announced the government‚Äôs new plan for social care. Entitled Build Back Better, and trailed by an extensive media briefing war between the prime minister and chancellor over the past few weeks, this plan makes various financial commitments on the NHS and social care funding.
It‚Äôs worth remembering Johnson‚Äôs words, as he stood in front of No 10 on his first day as prime minister, more than two years ago: ‚ÄúMy job is to make sure you don‚Äôt have to wait three weeks to see your GP, and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the frontline.

Then he retweeted a US bitcoin journalist who had successfully paid for his McDonald‚Äôs breakfast using the cryptocurrency.

The trial of the five accused for their role in the attacks has yet to begin. The session which began on Tuesday was the resumption of pre-trial hearings, now in their ninth year and with no clear end in sight. They have been bogged down in procedural problems and the central issue haunting the entire process, the admissibility of evidence obtained by the CIA under torture.

However Stokes is currently taking an indefinite break from cricket in order to prioritise his mental health and continue rehabilitation from finger surgery in April and England‚Äôs head coach, Chris Silverwood, appears unwilling to rush a second return after Stokes briefly captained a depleted 50-over side earlier this summer.

Tributes have been paid to three people who died after a lorry crashed on a dual carriageway.
Tina Ince, 58, and Tom Watson, 30, who were from Southampton, had both pulled over to help Alex Britton, 28, from Portsmouth, whose vehicle was at the side of the A303 near Andover on the morning of 25 August after breaking down.

In the former red wall seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central, which the Conservatives won for the first time in 2019 with a majority of just 670, opinion on the government‚Äôs new plans for health and social care funding was split.
In one camp were many who felt the national insurance hike was justifiable, a post-pandemic necessity to fund a struggling NHS and social care sector, and it was only fair that the burden should be shared across the population.

Nesrine Malik‚Äôs excellent article (For Afghan refugees Britain‚Äôs warm welcome will soon become cold comfort, 6 September) highlights many of the issues facing Afghan refugees. Unfortunately, once asylum status has been granted, the second layer of bureaucracy awaits them. Unless they can find immediate employment, which pays enough to support themselves and their family without the need for state support, those granted leave to remain will enter the benefits system administered by the Department for Work and Pensions.
The benefits system caps assistance offered with both housing costs and support for children ‚Äì no universal credit payable for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017.

                    <span>Effective support requires the provision of basic needs but services are overwhelmed, writes Siobhan Bryant
As a senior child and adolescent mental health nurse working in the NHS, I cannot agree more that young people need more than antidepressants (Children face a mental health crisis, but they need more than antidepressants, 4 September). I would go further and say that they also need more than therapy or talking-cure interventions. They need mental health interventions joined with other vital government agencies in order to make effective changes to their lived experience.
I meet many children and young people who are suffering because of very poor housing, serious parental mental health issues and the unavailability of a social worker to support the complex needs of the family. But I am unable to access the necessary support from appropriate agencies to address these issues. The reason is because these agencies, in particular children‚Äôs services, are overwhelmed with referrals and unable to respond. This means that as a society we are not able to safeguard a generation of children and young people.

Playing stick-up man Omar Little on The Wire, Michael K Williams was tough, frightening and brutal ‚Äì his face scarred, his smile wide, toting a shotgun and wearing a long trenchcoat. So viewers of David Simon‚Äôs intricate TV portrait of Baltimore‚Äôs streets, docks, schools and politics felt the rug pulled from under them when they first saw him kiss his boyfriend in episode four of season one.
It was a moment that subverted audience expectations and signalled the complexity, ambition and depth that The Wire ‚Äì which is often placed at or near the top of lists of the all-time greatest TV shows ‚Äì was aiming to achieve. This is not a character you‚Äôve seen before, the show seemed to be saying. These aren‚Äôt your usual stereotypes and cliches. A similar moment saw Idris Elba‚Äôs drug chief Stringer Bell attend a business studies class.

                    <span>A one-off boost to pensions now isn‚Äôt unfair if it means greater security in retirement for generations to come
The ‚Äútriple lock‚Äù is the most high-profile and contested area of pensions policy. It is also the most misunderstood. The lock, which ensures state pensions rise annually by the highest of average earnings growth, inflation or 2.5%, is almost always discussed in terms of the trade-off between pensioner benefits and working-age benefits. But to frame it simply like this is an error.
Th√©r√®se Coffey has today announced the suspension of the triple lock. It will be welcomed by those who believe we need to rebalance public spending from the old to the young. However, despite many arguments to the contrary, young people are in fact among the main beneficiaries of the triple lock. They would actually suffer from its removal.

Angela Merkel has used what is likely to be her last speech in the German parliament to make her most impassioned intervention in the electoral race so far, urging the public to vote for her party‚Äôs beleaguered candidate over his surging centre-left rival.
The chancellor, who will stand down after federal elections on 26 September, warned of the possibility of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Greens governing the country in a coalition with the far-left Die Linke.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Downing Street has not ruled out a ‚Äúfirebreak‚Äù lockdown as a last resort if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by Covid cases in England, but denied there were plans for one during October‚Äôs half-term school holiday.
With deaths within 28 days of a positive test reaching 209 ‚Äì their highest level since 1 March ‚Äì and 37,489 positive cases on Tuesday, scientists warned that restrictions could again be necessary in the coming months, such as limits on gatherings and a return to compulsory indoor masking.

                    <span>Poor HRH. Why must misfortune dog him, when his only crime is a passion for lovely things paid for by other people?
One of my favourite modern curiosities is the ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion‚Äù page on the official website of the British royal family. ‚ÄúWe are proud to champion diversity throughout the organisation,‚Äù this auto-satirical cri de coeur runs. ‚ÄúWe employ and reward the very best talent, regardless of gender, race, ethnic or national origin, disability, religion, sexual orientation or age. And that‚Äôs how we seek out future potential too, recruiting from the widest available pool. Our approach to recruitment and selection is fair, open and based purely on merit.‚Äù
On what, sorry? If your reflexive response to this is to cackle ‚ÄúBUT YOU‚ÄôRE LITERALLY A HEREDITARY MONARCHY, YOU MAD BASTARDS‚Äù, then please: just relax. Simply allow the sentiment to splash on to you, like royal urine into a sample bottle that a valet is holding, and realise that we live in times where ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù can mean whatever the firm talking about it wants it to mean. In this case, a commitment to getting more black servants. (You may recall that the House of Windsor did have one mixed-race senior manager, but she and her husband left the organisation last year to take up a position with Netflix.) So yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter that this ‚Äúfirm‚Äù is one where ‚Äì by law ‚Äì you only get the big jobs because of who your parents are. As for that bit about ‚Äúrecruiting from the widest available pool‚Äù, you should simply read it as a reference to having made a mildly concerted effort to finally stop interbreeding with their cousins. ‚ÄúWe would never want a certain type,‚Äù this advanced bollocks insists. ‚ÄúThe key is to be individual and different.‚Äù

                    <span>As social distancing disappears at UK arts venues, artists and audiences who need to shield are uncertain of the future
Performers and audiences who are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) are being shut out of the arts due to a lack of ongoing safety provisions, according to a number of people within the sector who cite a ‚Äútwo-tier‚Äù cultural reopening.
While the rest of the population has been able to return to watching and taking part in live music and performance as of the end of July, those who are clinically vulnerable, who number around 3.7m or 6.7% of the British population, are still waiting for their freedom day.

Fred, London
It‚Äôs hard enough navigating the many pitfalls of the packed lunch, but remove the ability to heat or chill it, and no one would blame Fred for hotfooting it to his nearest Pret. Meat and fish, say, don‚Äôt take kindly to sitting in a sweaty sandwich bag for hours on end, so it‚Äôs wise to keep things veggie.

The government has announced the NHS will get ¬£36bn over the next three years which will be funded by a new ‚Äúhealth and social care levy,‚Äù which will be 1.25% paid by working adults, including those over the state pension age.
From October 2023, anyone with assets between ¬£20,000 and ¬£100,000 will be expected to contribute to the cost of their adult social care care, but will also be eligible for state support covering some of the costs. This support will be means tested, and no one will ever have to pay more than ¬£86,000 for care in their lifetime - roughly equivalent to three years of care.

In May 2020, the playwright Bess Wohl rented a house in Bellport, Long Island, a bayside village an hour or two from Manhattan. This was during the early months of the pandemic, when Wohl found herself running an impromptu summer camp for her three young children. With what little downtime she had, she began to Google the history of the area, becoming curious about a nearby town called Yaphank.
In the 1930s, Yaphank hosted a summer camp for German-American youth who dressed in brown shirts and jackboots. They marched along Adolf Hitler Street and Goebbels Street, greeting one another with cries of ‚ÄúHeil Hitler‚Äù. Flowerbeds were planted in the shape of swastikas.

Salah Abdeslam and 19 others are accused of planning, aiding and carrying out the 13 November suicide bomb and gun attacks on the Stade de France, bars, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall that killed 130 people and injured 490.

When my daughter Ella was little, I‚Äôd often see various tech products on my Facebook feed purporting to calm parents who were anxious about their baby‚Äôs sleep. Next to feeding, there‚Äôs likely no more anxiety-prone part of the day than a child‚Äôs bedtime ‚Äì the fear they‚Äôre not on a schedule, or that once they get on one, it‚Äôs the wrong one, or that once they‚Äôre actually asleep, they might never wake up.
I dismissed them out of hand ‚Äì we were sharing a room with Ella, and I was aware of her every snort and snuffle, though in retrospect, it seems obvious that we could have had her sleeping through the night a little earlier ‚Ä¶ if we‚Äôd only settled on a sleep training method.

                    <span>Amid Trump, #MeToo and rising hate crime, science writer Melinda Wenner Moyer decided it was time to learn how to stop her kids becoming ‚Äòassholes‚Äô. Her research became an unusual, much-needed parenting book
When Melinda Wenner Moyer looked around in the autumn of 2018, she saw everywhere what she would describe as ‚Äúassholes‚Äù. In the US and the UK, hate crime was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì rising. Across the world, #MeToo allegations continued to come. Donald Trump was in the White House and ‚ÄúI just felt like there was so much bad behaviour everywhere,‚Äù says Moyer. ‚ÄúI started thinking about my kids and worrying about ‚ÄòWho were they going to become?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat were they learning from this behaviour?‚Äô if they were seeing it on TV or hearing about it from their friends.‚Äù Moyer realised: ‚ÄúWhat I wanted more than anything else was for my kids to not grow up to be assholes.‚Äù
Moyer, a science journalist and parenting columnist, decided to go through the research and ended up writing a book with the pleasing title How to Raise Kids Who Aren‚Äôt Assholes. In the vast realm of parenting advice, there was plenty on diet, sleep and how to turn your child into a superhuman genius, but not a great deal on how to create a kind, compassionate person.

                    <span>A news interview I did was re-edited and misquoted by online conspiracy theorists. My advice is: get the vaccine

David LV Bauer is head of the RNA virus replication laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London

As a virologist, I‚Äôve spent the past year or more studying the novel coronavirus that has upended all our lives. Communicating our work to the public and speaking to the media is an important part of my job, and I‚Äôve always tried to be clear and accurate about the science: I believe the available vaccines against Covid-19 are safe, and they are our best route back to a more normal way of living.
I‚Äôve been concerned about the anti-vaccination movement since before the pandemic. But I never imagined that my own work could actually be part of their misinformation arsenal. So I was shocked to discover that a recent TV interview I did for ITV London News had been seized on by anti-vax and conspiracy activists and now has thousands of likes, shares and retweets across social media.

Twenty livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany, Britain or France ‚Äì and are receiving billions of dollars in financial backing to do so, according to a new report by environmental campaigners. 
Raising livestock contributes significantly to carbon emissions, with animal agriculture accounting for 14.5% of the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific reports have found that rich countries need huge reductions in meat and dairy consumption to tackle the climate emergency.

                    <span>Coal power has been the foundation for much of what Europe is today. But what has been the cost? Since 2016, half of the continent‚Äôs coal plants have closed, or are scheduled to close, as markets shift and the race to save the climate gathers speed. NGOs and grassroots organisations are working with communities to ensure the transition from coal is rapid, focused on renewables, and, most importantly, fair.
This increased attention on the people who have long lived with coal has revealed unsteadiness, illness and deep seams of injustice in communities across the continent. The photographer Dan Wilton joined the environmental law charity ClientEarth to investigate and document Europe‚Äôs journey beyond coal

                    <span>Last year, three cryptocurrency enthusiasts bought a cruise ship. They named it the Satoshi, and dreamed of starting a floating libertarian utopia. It didn‚Äôt work out
On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to ‚Äúdefend and promote freedom in all its dimensions‚Äù. From behind a large lectern, Friedman ‚Äì grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century ‚Äì laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.
Friedman called it seasteading: ‚ÄúHomesteading the high seas,‚Äù a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he‚Äôd founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (‚ÄúIf you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,‚Äù he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!‚Äù he declared.

This episode includes discussion of suicidal thoughts.
More than 43,000 wildfires have burned through more than 202,3428 hectares of land in the US so far this year. As well as one of the most alarming indications of the urgency of the climate crisis, the blazes have taken a huge toll on the men and women who are the frontline of defence against them. Firefighters work punishing hours for low pay, and frequently deal with depression, alcohol abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder.

                    <span>Air pollution kills more than malaria, HIV/Aids and TB combined but receives only 1% of development aid
Governments around the world gave 20% more in overseas aid funding to fossil fuel projects in 2019 and 2020 than to programmes to cut the air pollution they cause.
Dirty air is the world‚Äôs biggest environmental killer, responsible for at least 4m early deaths a year. But just 1% of global development aid is used to tackle this crisis, according to an analysis from the Clean Air Fund (CAF).

                    <span>BBC proms host says Covid pandemic has increased stigma, as people fear infecting others
Once considered simply a vital bodily function, coughing could be joining the list of unacceptably disruptive behaviours in theatres, along with excessive rustling, talking and using your mobile phone, as people have become more concerned about contagion risk due to Covid.
The change has been welcomed by BBC Proms host, Petroc Trelawny, who said one unexpected benefit of the pandemic that he has observed is that people no longer disturb performances in theatres by ‚Äúcoughing unnecessarily‚Äù.
In an interview with the Radio Times, Trelawny speculated that the stigma associated with potentially infecting others with Covid could mean that it will no longer be considered acceptable to cough in public, in a change that would be ‚Äúparticularly beneficial to music lovers‚Äù.

‚ÄúGood times never seemed so good,‚Äù chanted Europe‚Äôs delirious players. You bet they didn‚Äôt. Just a second Solheim Cup win for those in blue and yellow on United States soil. This one arrived minus a travelling support. Take a bow, Catriona Matthew, who has captained her team in back-to-back triumphs.
Bare statistics belie the story of an exceptional day under the Toledo sun. This should be a watershed moment for women‚Äôs golf. What a pity that the Solheim shift to even years does not kick in until 2024. The standard of play at the Inverness Club was genuinely outstanding.

Two of the most senior figures in European football have attacked Fifa‚Äôs plans to reform the international calendar and implement a biennial World Cup, warning they risk diluting the game‚Äôs ‚Äújewel‚Äù and will put players‚Äô health at risk.
Speaking at a meeting of the European Club Association in Geneva, Uefa‚Äôs president, Aleksander Ceferin, told representatives of more than 100 clubs: ‚ÄúYou have probably heard that Fifa is conducting a feasibility study about the World Cup every two years. Well, we think that the jewel of the World Cup has value precisely because of its rarity. Holding it every two years will lead to less legitimacy, and it will unfortunately dilute the World Cup itself.

Hundreds of people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel, as several charities said the current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan showed why people risk their lives to flee.
It followed a first day of landings in more than two weeks on Sunday, after a run of bad weather put a halt to the crossings. A Home Office source said reports of 1,000 migrants entering the UK across the Channel in a single day is an exaggeration, and believed the figure will be between 800 and 850.

Raducanu faces Belinda Bencic in last eight

In the searing cauldron of the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the biggest tennis court on the planet, Emma Raducanu continued her astonishing three-week run from the empty US Open qualifying event towards the top tables of the sport by eviscerating yet another experienced top 50 opponent with a vital mixture of intelligence and consistency. In just 65 minutes, Raducanu defeated Shelby Rogers 6-2, 6-1 to reach her maiden grand slam quarter-final.
With her victory, Raducanu became just the third qualifier in the Open era to reach the US Open quarter-finals. Incredibly, after seven matches and three top 50 opponents, she has still not dropped any of her 14 sets. She arrived in the fourth round having lost fewer games than any other player and she has shown no sign of stopping.

My seven-year-old had beatboxed ‚Äì if the noise he made might be so described ‚Äì half the way to Earls Court, a have-a-go spirit I hoped he‚Äôd carry into what‚Äôs advertised as an interactive show.
In the event, he wasn‚Äôt given the chance ‚Äì or at least, not in the manner promised. ‚ÄúPick up beatboxing tips to impress your friends,‚Äù it says on the tin, but no such tips ‚Äì nor any opportunity to have a go ‚Äì were offered by comedian Jarred Christmas and UK loop station champion Hobbit. Instead, there‚Äôs a section on ‚Äúknock, knock‚Äù jokes and their affinities with hip-hop ‚Äì for which the kids present were invited to set their favourite examples to the Hobbit‚Äôs mouth-music. The finale asked volunteers to contribute sounds to a ‚Äúsong of the day‚Äù assembled on-the-hoof on Hobbit‚Äôs loop station. But Christmas instructed them which sounds to make (a cat ‚Äì for example ‚Äì enjoying itself on a rollercoaster, then being sick): this interactivity was strictly circumscribed.

                    <span>Followers arrive in Bras√≠lia and S√£o Paulo in hope of staging show of support for beleaguered Brazilian president
Thousands of diehard Jair Bolsonaro followers have converged on Brazil‚Äôs political and economic capitals hoping to stage a colossal show of support for their beleaguered president amid mounting fears over the future of Brazilian democracy and of possible skirmishes with the government‚Äôs opponents.
The rightwing nationalist, who recently warned Brazil could face a political ‚Äúrupture‚Äù, is expected to address packed independence day rallies in Bras√≠lia and S√£o Paulo on Tuesday in what observers say is an increasingly weak politician‚Äôs attempt to project strength.

Plans for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland have been suspended indefinitely by the UK after negotiations with the EU reached a stalemate.
Grace periods designed to ease the transition into new trading arrangements and checks on the island of Ireland have twice been extended as part of diplomatic wrangling labelled ‚Äúthe sausage wars‚Äù.

Spoiled for choice. On hearing that Boris Johnson was giving a Commons statement on Afghanistan, most MPs had been quick to spot the upside of being spared the ordeal of Dominic Raab again sounding baffled that Afghanistan fell under his brief in a statement of his own.
After all, during his two-hour session in front of the foreign affairs select committee last Wednesday, Dom had managed ‚Äì in between blaming everyone else for his own failings ‚Äì to make out as if it was a major imposition to be expected to do his job. Perhaps he still hasn‚Äôt come to terms with cutting short his hols. He even claimed he had simultaneously been completely prepared for the Taliban takeover and totally surprised by it. Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs war.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

Before the pandemic, the queues outside Caf√© Istanbul in Manchester city centre would be out of the door. Eighteen months later, business is still quiet. ‚ÄúEven now, with people returning to the office, it is not like what it was before,‚Äù said Muzaffer Karanal, the head chef at one of the city‚Äôs oldest independent restaurants.
As pupils return to school and offices slowly reopen, most businesses around the city centre have not had the mass return of customers they were hoping for after Covid measures were lifted. Karanal is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will result in the return of packed lunchtimes during which his restaurant ‚Äúnever stopped‚Äù.

The first signs of a commuter revival in the capital appeared on Monday as London Underground recorded its busiest morning since the start of the pandemic ‚Äì although schools may have played a bigger role than offices in increasing journeys.
Rush-hour trips on the tube were up 17% from last Tuesday, to just under a million ‚Äì their highest since March 2020. Buses also saw 39% more passengers, according to Transport for London figures for the period to 10am on Friday.

                    <span>Gavin Williamson is a weak leader. But families and teachers have been let down by the government as a whole 
As English schools reopen for the autumn, relief and pleasure are mixed with apprehension and anger. Given the government‚Äôs shabby record on shepherding schools through the pandemic, it could be no other way. Even now, with a new term under way, confusion surrounds the question of whether younger teenagers are to be vaccinated. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, and his counterparts in the devolved administrations, are seeking advice from the chief medical officers, which could override last week‚Äôs decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to support a full rollout.
The catch-up budget for England, of ¬£50 per year per pupil, is so small as to be an insult (by contrast, the Education Policy Institute pointed out, the US government has committed to spending an additional ¬£1,600 per pupil, and the Netherlands ¬£2,500). This decision led Sir Kevan Collins to resign as catch-up tsar four months after being appointed. Sir Kevan thought he had secured a commitment to a ¬£15bn package, only to be offered ¬£1.4bn instead.

                    <span>MPs have a choice ‚Äì to fight for voting rights or fight against them
In a democracy, it is vital that elections are both secure and open to all. Voters must trust the result and know that it has not been fraudulently obtained. Polls suggest that they do: public confidence in elections is the highest for a decade. There is room for improvement. Steps, recommended by civil society and academics, could be taken to make party finance more transparent, beef up the power of the regulator and expand the franchise. Yet with its election bill, the second reading of which begins on Tuesday, the government has ignored such advice. Its proposals will damage democracy and make it easier to buy influence.
The government proposes to make the Electoral Commission subservient to the Speaker‚Äôs committee, a parliamentary body on which the Tories have a majority, and have the minister for the constitution keep a hand on its tiller. This appears vindictive revenge on the commission because it dared to do its job. The Tories cannot forgive the regulator for investigating Vote Leave or Boris Johnson‚Äôs Downing Street flat refurbishment. Ministers want to rob the commission of the power to prosecute, knowing perhaps how reluctant police are to investigate political corruption. This will shield wrongdoing.

The move puts the Welsh church at odds with the Church of England, which forbids clergy to bless same-sex marriages. It falls short of allowing same-sex marriages in church, and includes a ‚Äúconscience clause‚Äù, allowing individual clergy to decide whether or not to offer blessings.

Very occasionally, however, a rider strikes a more than welcome blow for the smaller fry.

                    <span>Comics including Romesh Ranganathan pay tribute to ‚Äòcaring and terrific‚Äô standup, whose death from cancer has been announced
The comedian Phil Jerrod, known for his richly lyrical observations and tirades, delivered with surreal flights of fancy, has died from cancer aged 42. His agency, Off the Kerb, announced on Monday that Jerrod had died at home ‚Äúwith his devoted wife Beck by his side‚Äù and described him as ‚Äúa dear friend to us, an incredibly kind and talented man‚Äù.
Tributes were paid on social media by standups including Dane Baptiste, who called him a ‚Äúgreat comic‚Äù and ‚Äúa good man with a kind soul‚Äù. Jacob Hawley said: ‚ÄúI frequently retell so many of the wise, supportive things he told me when I was a new act. Made every car journey/green room a happier place.‚Äù Sean McLoughlin said Jerrod was ‚Äúspectacularly talented, cool and probably the nicest person in the business. We should all aim to be more like him.‚Äù

The UK‚Äôs vaccine advisory group behaved like a medical regulator in rejecting calls for all children aged 12-15 to be offered Covid jabs despite that not being its role, Prof Neil Ferguson has said.
Last week the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the margin of benefit for older children, on health grounds alone, was too small for the committee to support jabs for the entire age group.

The NHS will get more money over the next three years than the Treasury had planned after last-ditch lobbying for a bigger budget by the health and social care secretary, Sajid Javid.
Whitehall sources said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had been persuaded to increase the funding he intended to hand the NHS by at least ¬£1bn, taking the expected rise from ¬£5bn to at least ¬£6bn a year.

Jacob Jackson could have been born healthy, Shrewsbury and Telford hospital trust (Sath) has accepted, if it had arranged an earlier delivery in October 2018 as his mother, Charlotte, had suggested.

As Leylah Annie Fernandez basked in the joy of her improbable third round comeback win over Naomi Osaka earlier last week, she was asked on the court in her post-match interview at what point she truly believed that she could topple such a champion. Her response was immediate. ‚ÄúFrom the very beginning,‚Äù Fernandez said. The crowd reacted with a surprised murmur. ‚ÄúRight before the match, I knew I was able to win.‚Äù
Against Osaka, Fernandez had trailed 7-5, 6-5 as the third seed served for a straight-sets win. Two days later, Angelique Kerber led their contest 6-4, *4-3 and appeared to have taken the upper hand in a tight tussle. Both times that Fernandez found herself at the cliff edge, she elevated her level and recovered her footing to win.

GP surgery staff are facing abuse from patients who are ‚Äúangry and upset‚Äù that their blood test has been cancelled because of the NHS-wide chronic shortage of sample bottles.
‚ÄúPatients are angry when we ring them up and say, ‚ÄòSorry we can‚Äôt do your blood test after all‚Äô. A lot of people are quite angry and concerned about their own health,‚Äù Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of council at the British Medical Association, said.

                    <span>Readers give their views on the funding of social care and the contribution they have made
Can someone tell me why the narrative around the raising of national insurance and income tax constantly alludes to the importance of pensioners paying their fair share (Raising national insurance to fund social care is fraught with political risk, 3 September)? I started my working life in the 1970s, when the average tax for low- and middle-income earners was 40%-50%. This compares with the 20% currently being paid. My generation paid this high rate gladly, on the assumption that we were investing in a health and welfare system that would protect us from birth to grave. All of us pensioners deserve every penny we are receiving, as we have paid our fair share.
Surely, the focus of our egalitarian concerns should be the top earners whose tax has dropped from 75%/83% in the 70s to 45%. This has arguably lead to the discrepancy in wealth distribution, and a struggling health and welfare service.

                    <span>A culture of increasing profit by reducing costs, with frontline workers paying the price, has led to the crisis in road transport, says Richard Simpson 
As a former editor of Trucking magazine, I can only say that the shortage of truck drivers has been a long time coming (HGV driver shortages could ‚Äòcancel‚Äô Christmas, warns Iceland boss, 25 August). Road transport shares with the social care industry an enduring culture of increasing profit by reducing costs, with frontline workers paying the price. Both transport and care are now dominated by agencies, which seem to do little for the pounds of flesh that they extract from staff and clients. Unsurprisingly, people prefer to earn a living in other ways.
There are about 600,000 people holding LGV cat C (rigid truck) or cat C+E (articulated lorry) licences in the UK who do not currently drive trucks for a living. Why would they want to return to the job? Facilities are poor, the hours brutal and the responsibilities onerous. And these are only going to get worse. The latest changes to the highway code appear to make truck drivers entirely responsible for the stupidity of childish ‚Äúvulnerable road users‚Äù who are now being encouraged to treat the road as a playground while ‚Äúadult‚Äù drivers look after them. A rethink is needed.

The exhibition, now in its 70th year, is the second oldest of its kind. After the Venice Biennale, it is regarded as one of the most important events in the art world calendar.

In fact, Wolfson‚Äôs sympathy was less than zero. ‚ÄúIt strikes me as being insane that, despite the fact that everyone knows that we desperately need drivers, the Home Office is still preventing people coming to this country to work as drivers,‚Äù he said.

                    <span>Every morning, he delivers the German poll ratings to me. It has become clear that ‚Äì apart from a zoo full of bonobos ‚Äì nothing would make him happier than a win for the Social Democratic party
The German elections fall on Mr Z‚Äôs birthday, and he‚Äôs decided that, as a gift to him, he would like the SPD to win. Neither of us knows a huge amount about German politics. I have some pretty good intel, from a podcast I made, that everyone standing is deeply disappointing, and nobody should win. My Mr, by contrast, has decided that Olaf Scholz represents real change. Every morning, he delivers the poll ratings. The party has gone from being 20 points behind to five points ahead. It is impossible to guess why this makes him so happy. I floated the idea that maybe he was divining some parallel uptick in Labour‚Äôs fortunes. But he said no, he just really wants to see the Social Democratic party surge to victory. From the heavy significance of his voice and eyebrows, I managed to pick up that it is my responsibility to deliver on this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible,‚Äù I said ‚Äì I am, after all, totally abreast of the polls. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs impossible for me to make this happen.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else I want.‚Äù
The other thing he urgently wants is to see a zoo full of bonobos. There are only two, one in Antwerp and one in Twycross, and he‚Äôs prepared to compromise and stay local, but he‚Äôs not prepared to budge on the teenagers, who must accompany us and be in a good mood about it. He thinks I can make this fly by describing the matrilineal society of bonobos, and how well they model the community ideal, of pure pleasure and cooperation, when the females are in charge. I counter that we could also model this ideal, put me in charge, I‚Äôd leave the kids at home, and we could enjoy the zoo, just the two of us, and that would be a Perfect Day. He said that was droll, but it wasn‚Äôt what he wanted, and it was his birthday.

A return flight from the UK to New York could cost the global economy more than $3,000 (¬£2,170) in the long run, owing to the effects of the climate crisis, according to a report.
Researchers examined the economic cost of the climate crisis and found it would cut about 37% from global GDP this century, more than twice the drop experienced in the Great Depression.

Nicolas Gentile, a 37-year-old Italian pastry chef, did not just want to pretend to be a hobbit ‚Äì he wanted to live like one. First, he bought a piece of land in the countryside of Bucchianico, near the town of Chieti in Abruzzo, where he and his wife started building their personal Shire from JRR Tolkien‚Äôs fictional Middle-earth.
Then, on 27 August, alongside a group of friends and Lord of the Rings fans dressed as an elf, a dwarf, a hobbit, a sorcerer and humans, he walked more than 120 miles (200km) from Chieti to Naples, crossing mountains and rivers, to throw the ‚ÄúOne Ring‚Äù, a central plot element of The Lord of the Rings saga, into the volcano crater of Mount Vesuvius.

Jean-Paul Belmondo, star of Breathless, dies aged 88
A life in pictures

On the streets of Paris, car thief and fugitive cop killer Michel Poiccard has just been gunned down by the police, having shown an insolent, fatalistic attitude to the idea of getting caught, and indeed to the revelation that his American girlfriend Patricia, wannabe journalist and street vendor of the New York Herald Tribune, has ratted him out. She leans over Michel as he lies dying in a puddle of blood. Will Michel come up with some resonant last words? Not exactly. Defying agony from his bullet wounds, he just clownishly stretches his face into the two silly expressions he‚Äôd earlier used to explain the phrase ‚Äúfaire la t√™te‚Äù: a goofy silent scream, then a panto grin. Isn‚Äôt this what acting is, what life is: tragedy, comedy, faces, speeches? Who cares?
This unforgettably bizarre, throwaway gesture ‚Äì the equal of ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs looking at you, kid‚Äù from Michel‚Äôs beloved Bogart ‚Äì set the seal on Jean-Paul Belmondo‚Äôs sensational breakthrough in 1960 in Jean-Luc Godard‚Äôs equally legendary debut, √Ä Bout de Souffle (AKA Breathless), from a treatment by Fran√ßois Truffaut and Claude Chabrol, and co-starring Jean Seberg as the American mesmerised by his erotic, existential bravado.

A group of drivers at the Booker distribution network, which is part of Tesco, and more than 200 drivers and engineers at Hanson, the cement producer, have moved closer to industrial action in disputes over pay and conditions.

Jean-Paul Belmondo: the beaten-up icon who made crime sexy
A life in pictures

Jean-Paul Belmondo, the French actor who shot to international fame in Jean-Luc Godard‚Äôs revolutionary new wave classic Breathless, has died aged 88. The actor‚Äôs lawyer confirmed the news to AFP.
Belmondo ‚Äì nicknamed B√©bel by French audiences ‚Äì became one of the country‚Äôs biggest box-office stars in the 60s and 70s, his battered-looking face a contrast to the chiselled features of his rival and sometime-collaborator Alain Delon. Like Delon, Belmondo was a key figure of the outstanding generation of European film-making of the period, with the series of films he made with Godard ‚Äì which included A Woman Is a Woman and Pierrot le Fou ‚Äì making an indelible mark.

‚ÄúI learned how women delivered babies from watching YouTube videos. So I had to give back. I had to share.‚Äù Patricia Bright is chatting to me by Zoom from her home in south London. Behind her is the garden office that her almost 3 million subscribers will recognise as the studio where she does her filming. We‚Äôre discussing her birthing vlogs, among them My Unexpected Labour and Delivery Story, one of which was filmed in the hallway metres from where she is sitting.
Bright is a YouTube sensation ‚Äì a beauty, fashion and lifestyle guru who began making videos more than 10 years ago while working in the City, long before the phrase, ‚ÄúHi, guys, welcome back to my channel,‚Äù was used ironically. She is celebrated as one the first black British YouTube to gain 1 million subscribers, but the 34-year-old‚Äôs true skill is building an empire from being a proud oversharer with a dry sense of humour and an infectious personality. She feels like your best friend or your auntie, depending on which you need. She also has no qualms in acknowledging that ‚Äì as with midwifery ‚Äì she may not be the most qualified person in every area she covers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a hairdresser, I‚Äôm not a makeup artist, I‚Äôm not a fashion expert, and I‚Äôm not a financial expert.‚Äù She adds, however, with the confidence of a YouTube veteran: ‚ÄúIf you want to create content in that area, you can do that.

At the time, during the Seven Years‚Äô War, the execution divided the establishment and the country. But he had failed ‚Äúto do his utmost‚Äù to comply with his instructions to take the island of Minorca in the Mediterranean, and during a global war that was not good enough.

                    <span>It may be the first Marvel film not to be approved in mainland China, but its American Chinese heritage hero and strong female representation are badass
This time last year I was disheartened by the troubling ways that Disney‚Äôs live-action Mulan collaborated with the Chinese government to squander a golden opportunity to adapt the animated film, going so far as to alter its screenplay to placate state censors and shoot the film in Xinjiang, in the same area as Uyghur detention camps.
So I had few expectations of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, other than the casting of Hong Kong legend Tony Leung Chiu-Wai in his first Hollywood role, as Xu Wenwu the corruptible-though-redeemable crime lord and grieving father of protagonist Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). It was therefore a satisfying prove-me-wrong moment to watch the film in a cinema filled with an audience who whooped at every meticulously choreographed levitating kick, punch and tai chi-inspired fight sequence. I left with hope and elation, not disappointment.

It was the big Brexit lie. No, not the ¬£350m a week to spend on the NHS or the ‚Äúbonfire‚Äù of red tape. The lie was that the shambles now enveloping British trade with Europe was an unavoidable price worth paying to leave the EU. That was rubbish.
In order to further his chances of becoming Tory leader Boris Johnson made two commitments. One was to resign from the EU, the other was to depart Europe‚Äôs customs union and single market, aspects of which embrace other non-EU states such as Norway. The second decision was an almost casual gesture to make him look macho to the party‚Äôs hardline Brexiters. It was not put to referendum and was beyond stupid.

A significant rebellion is building up against plans to fund social care changes that are expected to be announced this week.
Despite cabinet ministers scrambling to finalise details of potential rises in taxes or national insurance contributions (NICs), reports of the latest version of the proposals have already sparked a significant backlash.

The group posted pictures on social media showing Taliban fighters standing in front of the gate of the governor‚Äôs compound. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement, saying Panjshir was under the control of Taliban fighters.

 Last month, fat-cat futurist Elon Musk announced the Tesla Bot, a general-purpose robotic humanoid designed to tackle ‚Äúboring, repetitious‚Äù tasks. Suspiciously, there was no working prototype.

Fideos are wafer-thin string noodles that, along with capers, were brought over to Mexico by the Spanish from Sicily, an island they also occupied for a few hundred years. The result was sopa seca (literally meaning dry soup), a fantastically flavoured pasta dish from Veracruz, in which the noodles are sauteed until brown, then simmered in a rich tomato sauce spiked with smoky chipotle relish, plus fresh crab meat, a scattering of capers and fresh lime.

A survey by the Open University found that 61% of people took up something creative in 2020 ‚Äì nearly a third reported reading for pleasure, with cooking close behind, while crafts such as knitting and photography were also embraced. It also reported a 622% increase in registrations for online creative courses, while Pinterest had a 130% increase in viewings of sewing videos. Now, as life starts to get busier, how do we keep our newfound creative practice alive?

Thomas discovered pornography in the traditional way: at school. He remembers classmates talking about it in the playground and showing each other videos on their phones during sleepovers. He was 13 and thought it was ‚Äúa laugh‚Äù. Then he began watching pornography alone on his tablet in his room. What started as occasional use, at the beginning of puberty, became a daily habit.
Thomas (not his real name), who is in his early 20s, lived with one of his parents, who he says did not care what he was doing online. ‚ÄúAt the time, it felt normal, but looking back I can see that it got out of hand quite quickly,‚Äù Thomas says. When he got a girlfriend at 16, he started having sex and watched less pornography. But the addiction was just waiting to resurface, he says.

The schools, scattered across the country, were aimed at eradicating the culture and languages of the country‚Äôs Indigenous populations.
The findings have brought the world‚Äôs renewed attention to this shameful chapter of Canadian history, left deep wounds in hundreds of communities and sparked fresh demands for justice aimed at the Canadian government and the churches that ran the schools for decades.

                    <span>After his handling of Covid, even hard-nosed colleagues marvel at the Welsh first minister‚Äôs popularity
There is a strong argument that the British politician whose reputation has been most enhanced by the challenges of the past 18 months is Mark Drakeford.
Despite having played a prominent role in devolved Welsh politics for almost two decades before that, at the time of his elevation to the role of Welsh Labour leader and first minister in December 2018, this unassuming west Walian remained largely unknown to the public. Even a year later, the low profile accorded to him in his party‚Äôs 2019 general election campaign suggests he was not regarded as an electoral asset.

Someone‚Äôs Daughter, curated by Jennie Ricketts and presented with The View magazine, is a new photography exhibition highlighting how female prisoners are seen and understood, with the ultimate aim of reimagining the justice system. The show is appearing at Photo London alongside an online benefit auction hosted by Artsy.
By photographing women who have been stigmatised by the law, the courts and the media in the administration of justice, and displaying them alongside professionals working in the criminal justice space, the exhibition seeks to change how formerly incarcerated women are perceived and ultimately the way justice is served.

Benafsha Yaqoobi, a commissioner at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), said she fears the Taliban will neglect and discriminate against people with disabilities due to the belief, held by many in the country, that disability is a punishment from God for the sins of parents.

Nadia Whittome originally made headlines when she became the ‚Äúbaby of the house‚Äù in 2019, elected at the age of 23 as Labour MP for Nottingham East, in an election whose main take-home was how many seats Labour had lost. She was a firebrand or maverick ‚Äì insert your favourite term for ‚Äúdisobedient‚Äù ‚Äì from the start: hard-remain when Corbyn‚Äôs office was all about the lexiters, further to the left than Starmer has turned out to be (so far).
So she was never going to be a quiet backbencher, working her way strategically through the party ranks, but her next headlines were a long way from politics. In May this year, she announced her decision to take time off because of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a parliamentary culture in which even MPs who have to give birth or have chemotherapy are surrounded by endless discussion about whether they can still do their job, this was a momentous act, signalling to many that Whittome belonged to a new, more honest culture. Angela Rayner, Labour‚Äôs deputy leader, said at the time that her colleague had ‚Äúshown so much bravery and ‚Ä¶ will have helped so many other people‚Äù, a view shared by many Conservatives. But Whittome wasn‚Äôt thinking of the career angle. ‚ÄúMy symptoms were getting worse rather than better. I couldn‚Äôt be the energetic, effective MP that Nottingham needs and deserves, and, also for my own health, I needed time and space to recover. I didn‚Äôt worry about my political future, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about that at all.‚Äù

August is moulting season, when seals shed their coats and grow new ones, spending much of their day on the sandbanks as a result. This makes it a good time for scientists to count them, with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) running its three-day annual seal survey, using boats and a specially chartered light aircraft to get a view from above.

Some 600 theatregoers at a time will be given free rein to walk around the contrasting ancient worlds of Troy and Mycenae, each given a dystopian sci-fi spin, where they will encounter gods, monsters and perhaps a secret passageway or two over a three-hour evening.

The labour crisis could last for up to two years, Britain‚Äôs leading business lobby group has warned, as it called for ministers to take action on visas for foreign workers and stop ‚Äúwaiting for shortages to solve themselves‚Äù.
Amid the most severe labour crunch since the 1970s, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) launched a broadside against the government, saying the UK‚Äôs economic recovery from the winter lockdown was being undermined by a lack of skills in key positions, with mounting risks that the problem would continue for some time.

Working in offices can give people asthma from exposure to substances such as printer toner and cleaning products, according to new research by an NHS doctor.
The findings show that working in an office is not necessarily safe and that working from home may be better to protect people‚Äôs health, said Dr Christopher Huntley.

The existing 10-year limit on the length of time those planning to use in-vitro fertilisation can store the genetic materials needed is being scrapped, the government said on Monday.

A World Cup qualifier between Argentina and Brazil was abandoned amid farcical, confused scenes after four Premier League players apparently violated Brazilian regulations designed to contain a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 580,000 Brazilians.
The Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Mart√≠nez and Tottenham‚Äôs Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were all on the pitch at S√£o Paulo‚Äôs Neo Qu√≠mica Arena on Sunday afternoon when federal police and officials from Brazil‚Äôs health agency, Anvisa, took to the field to halt play after just seven minutes.

As some families in Greenville, California started to return home this week after the Dixie fire tore through this town of about 800 residents, they were confronted by burnt remnants of their former lives. Some returned to find a makeshift grave for a family pet. Others walked through debris which, just a few weeks earlier, they had planned to sell.
Photographer Josh Edelson was at home, recuperating from a stretch of 20-hour days photographing the California wildfires, when he saw the alert from CalFire, the state‚Äôs department of forestry and fire protection, saying this week that residents could return home. The news came one month after the Dixie fire ‚Äì which has burned 893,852 acres since erupting on 14 July ‚Äì struck Greenville, and Edelson wanted to capture the moment.

As her US Open fourth round contest against Elina Svitolina fell further and further from her grasp, Simona Halep‚Äôs frustration was increasingly clear to see. She seethed endlessly towards her team, she tossed her racket multiple times and her frustration was written all over her face.
Across the net, however, there was nothing. No negative emotion whatsoever. Even when she faltered, Svitolina immediately shrugged the frustration off, her gameface firmly on. The only time she interacted with her team was to share positive pumped fists and knowing stares.

Baker, who is wanted by police for alleged crimes including murder, piracy and robbery, has been on the run from police since 2013. He has twice escaped jail ‚Äì one time by faking a knee injury and fleeing while he was being taken for medical treatment.

Iranian-American director Ana Lily Amirpour serves up heaped spoonfuls of B-movie thrills in Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon, in which a supernatural teen wanders wild in New Orleans. If the film is finally more moony than masterpiece, it does more than enough to keep her fanbase onside. Amirpour‚Äôs first film, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, was a vampire western; her second, The Bad Batch, a cannibal romance. On the menu this time: superhero gumbo. Grab a bowl and tuck in. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt look in the waitress‚Äôs eyes.
Jeon Jong-seo stars as Mona Lisa Lee, who exerts a form of hypnotic mind control that can make her enemies slap themselves, stab themselves or put a bullet in their own knees. She‚Äôs just busted out of the ‚ÄúHome For Mentally Insane Adolescents‚Äù where she‚Äôs been held for ten years, and now has to make sense of the world as she goes along. Seat belts are a puzzle and money is a foreign language. In one scene we see Mona gazing in abject mystification at an image of Donald Trump on TV ‚Äì and this at least suggests that the girl is learning fast.

Plans to raise national insurance contributions to increase funding for the NHS and to overhaul social care have been privately criticised by cabinet ministers ‚Äì and MPs have told the chief whip they could oppose the measures in the Commons.

As the shadows lengthened on the fourth evening, eventually engulfing the outfield at the Oval to end a day of glorious sunshine, England‚Äôs opening pair of Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed made an encouraging start to what is a tilt at history.
A dispiriting performance in the field from Joe Root‚Äôs side had let India put 466 all out on the board just after tea and, with this, a target of 368 in four sessions had been set. It will be England‚Äôs all-time record run chase if achieved, surpassing the 359 that Ben Stokes raided against Australia at Headingley two years ago, and by reaching 77 for no loss by the close, thoughts of another miracle lingered.

Yet as a spectacle itself, there was plenty to enjoy. England‚Äôs first return to Wembley since the penalty shootout loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final was marked by a fun atmosphere and the continued feeling that this is a team that people can get behind.

Nils Eekhoff of Team DSM takes second place in Cornwall

Bodmin, Paris and Tokyo have shared at least one experience this summer: the Wout van Aert juggernaut has rolled into town and made a lasting impression. Six weeks after taking the Olympic silver medal in the Olympic road race in Tokyo, and seven after taking the final stage of the Tour de France on the Champs-√âlys√©es, the Belgian national champion made straightforward work of winning stage one of the Tour of Britain to take the initial race lead. His post-Olympic break has clearly not affected his appetite or dulled his finishing speed.
Van Aert‚Äôs last five races have produced three wins ‚Äì he also took the Tour‚Äôs penultimate stage, a time trial ‚Äì that Olympic medal, and sixth place in the Olympic time trial. He currently sits on nine victories for the year, but few would bet against him adding at least one or two more before the British Tour hits Aberdeen next Sunday. And with a fair wind, he will start as favourite to win the world championship in his native Belgium towards the end of the month.

This shop‚Äôs policy now seems prescient.

To sit in the dark and watch Jack O‚ÄôConnell‚Äôs work, from the very earliest characters he played (a boy accused of rape in The Bill, Pukey the skinhead in This Is England) through to self-destructive lad Cook in teen drama Skins and the boy incarcerated with his dad in prison drama Starred Up, followed by a squaddie in Northern Ireland in the Troubles film ‚Äô71, is to watch a slow portrait of contemporary masculinity. What O‚ÄôConnell does, with his eyes and voice, and careful violence, is show the vulnerability beneath his characters‚Äô cracked shells, and I‚Äôm keen now to find out how much of them is him, and how much of him is them, and what he‚Äôs learned about masculinity.

                    <span>It affects up to 20% of women and can be as complex as depression at any stage of life. But support is there

The modern mind is a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their work

‚ÄúI want to be a good mother but I‚Äôm afraid. I didn‚Äôt have a good childhood.‚Äù
The nurse held back tears as she told me what the patient had told her. Involuntarily, I felt the prick of tears too, at her horror and the patient‚Äôs, conveyed in the recollection. It wasn‚Äôt that the abuse was violent or at a very young age. The betrayal of a child‚Äôs trust is hard to hear. The patient‚Äôs mother, herself neglected and vulnerable in childhood, had been largely unavailable, sometimes frightening, and immersed in her own addictions; her stepfather, the gentler parent, was also a substance user and had abused her, even as she tried to support him, so he could provide care for her.

As a working mother, one word has saved me as the pandemic has worn on: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I‚Äôve learned to say no to being the parent who will automatically take carer‚Äôs leave when childcare centres and schools close. No to being the only one to plan meals for the week. No to being the type of Instagram-worthy mother who mindfully makes her own hummus throughout lockdown.
Mastering the word has been liberating. It has freed up time, energy and headspace to do my paid work, focus on self-care essentials and actually enjoy free time with my family. It‚Äôs also supported a positive relationship with my partner because we both equally pull our weight at home, heading off the resentment that can fester in some relationships when the unequal division of labour takes its toll.

                    <span>For too many, the government encroaches upon their lives but cannot protect them
In his treatise Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes did not suggest that government was benevolent ‚Äì only necessary. Without it, argued the philosopher, people would live in perpetual fear in ‚Äúa war of all against all‚Äù and life would be ‚Äúsolitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short‚Äù. His argument‚Äôs urgency reflected its context ‚Äì the English civil war. But it recognised that the state had to be justified by a degree of consent from those it ruled.
The Nigerian government has a democratic mandate. Though President Muhammadu Buhari was once a dictator, his return to power in 2015 was the country‚Äôs first transition between democratically elected leaders. Voters chose him to tackle corruption and curb Boko Haram‚Äôs violence. But the state‚Äôs ability to carry out its most basic function, providing the basic physical security of which Hobbes wrote, is crumbling by the day. For too many Nigerians, the government is a force that encroaches on or plunders their lives without offering protection, let alone support. Unemployment is among the world‚Äôs worst, the cost of living is rising, the pandemic‚Äôs impact has deepened frustration and an oil price slump hurt the petro-dependent economy; all threaten to worsen widespread violence.

People need trees. A world without ilex, cinnamon and rosewood trees, a world devoid of magnolias, hornbeams and maples would be much the poorer. We rely on trees, of course, to absorb and store carbon dioxide. They provide us with food, fuel, medicine and construction materials. They shelter us from storms; they reduce soil erosion. Without them, other plants and animals would be lost for ever ‚Äì in the UK, native oaks feed and shelter about 2,300 other species. We are only beginning to fully comprehend their social nature and the ‚Äúwood wide web‚Äù which connects plants together through roots, fungi and bacteria. We need them, too, because their grace and beauty lift our spirits and restore our calm. 
There are almost 58,500 tree species in the world, a richness few of us can truly comprehend. But a shocking new international study has warned that between a third and half of those are at risk of extinction in the wild ‚Äì posing a risk of wider ecosystem collapse. The comprehensive report by Botanic Gardens Conservation International, which was five years in the making, found that twice as many tree species are threatened as mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles combined.

In the bowl of Tokyo‚Äôs Olympic Stadium on Sunday night, it all made sense.

                    <span>We should scrap NI and replace it with taxes on income and profit, writes Adrian Darnell, while Janet Briffett believes the poor will end up paying for the well-off
If fairness is the criterion by which to judge a tax (Editorial, 3 September), we would never really have introduced national insurance. It‚Äôs both an income tax and an employment tax; it‚Äôs regressive; it‚Äôs not paid by those above the state pension age; it incentivises the construction of imaginative subcontractor avoidance schemes; and it requires its own collection and recording scheme.
Why not, in the name of efficiency and fairness, abandon NI and replace it with simpler taxes on income and profit? This would ensure that those with the broadest shoulders bear the greatest burden (since income tax is progressive). It would widen the tax base ‚Äì income, whether through work or a pension, becomes liable for tax, independent of the age of the recipient, and employers become subject to tax by reference to the profits they earn, rather than a headcount of employees. Of course, headline rates of income tax will jump, but the resulting tax would be more fairly spread across all taxpayers (particularly because replacing a regressive with a progressive tax ensures the less well-off pay less).

After reading Philip Aylett‚Äôs letter about plans by the West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust to build a new hospital in Watford (31 August), I felt it only right to stand up for the trust‚Äôs well-considered and long-thought-through decision. After an extensive independent feasibility study looking at six potential sites, it was clear that the Watford option was the fastest route to getting desperately needed new facilities to serve patients across west Hertfordshire.
The trust‚Äôs senior clinicians have devised plans for services to be provided across three local hospitals, with Watford remaining the centre for emergency and specialist care services. These plans, and the availability of land at the Watford site, mean that this is by far the best option, with no need to purchase huge parcels of land or navigate the more complex planning legislation around building on greenfield. This means it is possible to deliver brand new health facilities far sooner.

I‚Äôve worked for an MP for 25 years and the workload has never been this crazy. In January 2016, we dealt with 40 pieces of casework. In January this year we dealt with 1,025. We‚Äôre now up to 4,639 cases so far this year, with a backlog of nearly 2,000 emails. We‚Äôre all absolutely knackered. We have two full-time caseworkers and one part-time researcher. Overnight we had to become experts in new areas: one of us focused on helping people with their finances while a colleague helped repatriate constituents from overseas.

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre all absolutely knackered‚Äô says MP‚Äôs office manager

MPs and their staff are buckling under the strain of a ‚Äúphenomenal‚Äù rise in appeals for help from constituents, with some reporting a 12-fold increase in casework fuelled in part by an ‚Äúabsolute crisis‚Äù in mental health issues.
Parliamentary aides said they were becoming burnt out and struggling to help people in desperate need, because of a ‚Äúmassive backlog‚Äù of issues caused by the Covid pandemic.

An elite national army unit has announced it has seized power in Guinea and deposed the country‚Äôs president, Alpha Cond√©, in an attempted coup, after heavy gunfire was heard near the presidential palace in the capital, Conakry, on Sunday morning.
Soldiers announced the country‚Äôs leadership had been deposed in the latest political upheaval to beset the mineral-rich and impoverished west African country, amid conflicting claims of who was in power.

The Dutch lion roared in front of a home crowd at Zandvoort that had come for a party and Verstappen proved a munificent host. Retaking the lead in the title fight by beating Mercedes‚Äô Lewis Hamilton into second was his reward in this tightly fought season that continues to ebb and flow.

Few memorials require restoration before they are complete, but that is the reality facing the bereaved who care for the national Covid memorial wall opposite the Houses of Parliament in London.
Armed with pots of crimson masonry paint, they have started refreshing the wall of more than 150,000 hearts, many of which are already fading in the sun and rain. They also have the sad task of adding 5,000 more, to catch up with the still-rising death toll. Like the pandemic, there is no end in sight. But soon, sections could be preserved using a specialist lacquer that has previously been deployed to protect street art by Banksy to create a memorial that could stand for years to come.

                    <span>Michael Franco‚Äôs latest collaboration with the actor sees Roth on a Mexican beach holiday, blissfully unaffected by grief 
Neil Bennett is enjoying a nice holiday at a Mexican resort with his sister, Alice, and her two teenage kids. They‚Äôve got the sea view and the infinity pool and a hotel entertainer to sing for them over supper. Then all of a sudden, disaster. The phone rings; their mother‚Äôs dead. So Neil does what any sensible son would do in his position. He pretends he‚Äôs lost his passport and therefore can‚Äôt fly home for the funeral. The woman‚Äôs dead anyway, so what does she care?
Clearly it‚Äôs wrong to laugh at Michel Franco‚Äôs brilliant Sundown but I‚Äôm afraid that I did all the same ‚Äì several times while watching the movie; several more times when remembering it afterwards. It‚Äôs the funniest film in this year‚Äôs Venice competition, also maybe the nastiest, although it never reaches for laughs or disgust and might just as easily be read as a small-scale human tragedy. Sundown shows Neil‚Äôs decision, then proceeds to stroll alongside him like an innocent party. It‚Äôs an approach that makes the film all the more blackly comic.

Healthy 12- to 15-year-olds could override their parents‚Äô decision on vaccination in the right circumstances, a minister has said, as the UK government prepares to overrule advice and extend jabs to younger teens.

                    <span>The self-described ‚ÄòBig Mouth‚Äô brought a rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll ethos to the manufactured Girls Aloud
For the release of Girls Aloud‚Äôs signature 2004 single Love Machine, the girlband juggernaut‚Äôs long-term graphic designers Form created a fictional magazine cover for each member. While Cheryl Tweedy is coquettish in cat ears for the stylish Love ‚Ä¶ mag and Nadine Coyle graces the cover of the Hello!-esque Aloud!, Sarah Harding appears in army fatigues on the cover of Girls, her warpaint augmented by a huge sparkly grin. It quotes a lyric (‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading for war‚Äù) accompanied by text that hammers the message home: ‚ÄúFighting talk from Sarah.‚Äù It‚Äôs the perfect encapsulation of the pop persona that Harding, who has died from cancer at the age of 39, attracted and often relished: the unruly, fun-loving, tomboyish rebel ‚Äì or, as she described it in her 2021 memoir, Hear Me Out, the ‚Äúrock chick, blonde bombshell, party girl, the caner of the band‚Äù.
It was Harding‚Äôs energy and passion that often gave Girls Aloud an extra frisson of excitement on stage, whether she was endearingly stumbling through dance routines or hitting the odd bum note. Post-Spice Girls, UK pop had become polished and pre-teen again, but with Girls Aloud there was a sense that you should expect the unexpected. Much of that revolved around Harding. As a teenager in Manchester, she was a huge fan of Liam Gallagher, and brought a rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll ethos to a manufactured band that could easily have defaulted to rote media-trained sheen. (Tellingly, her favourite Girls Aloud single was the pummelling, guitar-led Wake Me Up.)

TikTok has turned off notifications for children past bedtime, Instagram has disabled targeted adverts for under-18s entirely and YouTube has turned off autoplay for teen users: moves seemingly triggered by Britain introducing a new set of regulations aimed at protecting children online.
On Thursday the UK introduced a new set of regulations aimed at protecting children and at a stroke became a global leader in the field, with the prospect of multimillion-dollar fines for companies that breach its new ‚Äúage appropriate design code‚Äù leading to a cascade of last-minute changes across some of Silicon Valley‚Äôs largest players.

The Women‚Äôs Super League record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema opened the scoring in style, wrong‚Äëfooting Jess Carter to squeeze the ball between the near post and a diving Ann-Katrin Berger. Beth Mead added two ‚Äì the first lashed in from a tight angle, the second offside but not flagged ‚Äì after Erin Cuthbert had levelled. A header from Pernille Harder closed the gap but a late surge could not prevent Arsenal from securing a first league win against Chelsea since their 5-0 defeat of the Blues at Kingsmeadow in October 2018.

                    <span>Charlotte Northedge wrote a new novel in lockdown. She considers others who have realised the dreams of their youth
I wrote a novel in the last lockdown. To be clear, it wasn‚Äôt one of those creative outpourings some people had in between yoga with Adriene and baking banana bread. I had a deadline. Some days, I thought I‚Äôd never cut through the brain fog brought about by living through a pandemic. But gradually, as the initial panic subsided and the usual distractions of daily life fell away, I found the words did start to come, and the process of writing my second book was much more fluid and focused than my first.
Which is hardly surprising. I started my debut while on maternity leave with my second baby. I had dreamed of writing a novel since I was a child. I was one of those bookish kids whose weekly highlight was a visit to the library and who spent the best part of my teens squirrelling away short stories and beginnings of novels that never seemed to go anywhere. When I moved to London after my English degree, I joined a writing group and started a thriller.

                    <span>What makes a pub special? From the perfect place to flog atomic secrets to the official strictly protected viewpoint for St Paul‚Äôs, a new book tells the amazing stories behind the city‚Äôs greatest bars
When you stumble out of the medieval warren of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub on Fleet Street, it‚Äôs easy to think you‚Äôve had one too many. As you gaze east towards the dome of St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, the skyscrapers of the Square Mile appear to lean back in a woozy limbo, as if lurching to get out of the way.
It‚Äôs not the effect of the real ale, but the result of a curious planning rule. The City of London‚Äôs policies have long specified the pavement outside this particular pub as the hallowed spot from which Wren‚Äôs dome must be perfectly visible against the sky. Even the towers that stand behind it to the east, like the Cheesegrater and the Scalpel, derive their strange chamfered forms from having to preserve a sacred gap behind the cathedral‚Äôs silhouette, when seen from outside the pub.
Trace the lines of London‚Äôs historic protected views, and you‚Äôll find that many of them end up outside pubs. It reflects not just the fact that the surveyors enjoyed a pint or two, but the central importance of the public house in shaping the history of the city ‚Äì a phenomenon that is celebrated in a new book.
‚ÄúThere are already so many books about pubs,‚Äù says David Knight, co-author of Public House with Cristina Monteiro. ‚ÄúWe wanted this one to be different. It‚Äôs not a guide to the best places to have a pint but a collection of social and cultural histories, trying to bring together a more diverse range of voices to explore the value of pubs to the city and society.‚Äù While the majority of pub literature may be of the stale white male genre, this compendium includes South Asian Desi pubs, African-Caribbean pubs, and a range of pubs that have played a role in LGBTQ+ history.

                    <span>Clifton Downs, Bristol
Joe Talbot dominated the Bristol band‚Äôs post-lockdown homecoming with spring-loaded unpredictability
It‚Äôs an eternal question: is it a faux pas to wear a band‚Äôs T-shirt to one of their shows? The implied answer from thousands of Idles fans wandering the rolling fields of Clifton Downs is no. This is a sprawling event, featuring 16 acts on three stages, plus bonus late summer sunshine, and yet a reminder of who‚Äôs topping the bill is never more than a few feet away.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt done this in a while, and neither have you,‚Äù vocalist Joe Talbot says from the stage, the afternoon‚Äôs disparate gatherings having coalesced into one heaving mass. It‚Äôs only a white lie. After travelling down the M4 like a 10-legged version of Phil Collins, this is Idles‚Äô second outing of the day, following a lunchtime appearance at Wide Awake festival in London. That engagement apparently blew any cobwebs away.

The man did not have the filched card worth ‚Ç¨500,000 (¬£429,000) on him, but he did have a plane ticket for Fuerteventura, the LaPresse news agency said on Sunday.

Astrid Sletten is the Afghanistan country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council

It felt surreal to be flying into Kabul international airport rather than out, crossing paths with families who were trying to flee. For three days I sat stranded in a field hospital in the airport grounds, the crowds and chaos blocking any route into the city, the popping of guns blocking any notion of sleep.
I had returned to Afghanistan to head up the Norwegian Refugee Council‚Äôs aid operation, through which we have been providing assistance such as education, food and shelter since 2003. Speaking with many of my colleagues, it is clear Afghanistan‚Äôs humanitarian crisis stretches far beyond the perimeter of Kabul airport.

                    <span>With passenger numbers growing and time to slash emissions dwindling fast, the industry must tackle urgent stumbling blocks on fuel, frequent flyers and more
Aviation tanked in 2020. The number of people taking flights fell by three quarters compared with 2019 levels and as a result there was a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. But as countries open up and people begin to fly again, aviation is expected to see a slow climb back to previous levels. The industry anticipates a return to 2019 passenger numbers globally by 2023 and to be back on track with previous growth projections within a couple of decades.
All this is bad news for the planet. CO2 emissions from the industry are likely to triple by 2050. But if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C, it needs to have hit net zero CO2 emissions by this time. Aviation is a complicated sector to decarbonise. It has some prickly ingredients: difficult technological solutions, hidden extra climate effects, an association with personal freedoms and a disproportionately wealthy and powerful customer base. Here are just a few of the big hurdles the sector will need to overcome if it is ever to be carbon neutral.

It is a business model whose success is based on the fact that so many have been priced out of city living by the housing crisis. Perhaps it would be a good thing if Pocket‚Äôs niche did not exist?

Afghanistan is on the brink of economic meltdown. Millions of people are going hungry. Teachers and doctors are going unpaid. The social infrastructure built up over the past 20 years is collapsing, The banks are running out of money. Total collapse could come in days rather than weeks.
A catastrophe can still be avoided but only if politicians in the west ‚Äì and primarily those in Washington and London ‚Äì accept that they lost and the Taliban won. Unless the international community engages with Afghanistan‚Äôs new rulers and finds a way of providing financial support it will be a classic example of self-harm.

As summer withers away and politicians and journalists prepare for the return of party conferences, a tantalising fantasy is in play, mostly in Conservative circles.
The worst of the pandemic, we are told, is now over. In England employers are starting to reduce working from home, and schools are reopening with hugely reduced Covid protocols. A large part of the public in England seems to believe that life has at last been uncoupled from Covid and its effects, and is somehow being returned to normal, although Brexit-related shortages are twisting reality in yet another unsettling way. At the top of the Tory party, meanwhile, the political optimism ignited by vaccines is still alive, and there remains a hope that ministers might somehow slip free of the Covid crisis and begin to leave the whole mess behind.

It came back positive.
I didn‚Äôt tell anyone at school I was pregnant, but I called my mom. She assured me it would be OK, and told me to schedule an appointment nearby, rather than drive home to New York. She was right; I probably didn‚Äôt need a seven-hour car ride of contemplative dread.

As disgraced 91-year-old cardinal Theodore McCarrick stood in an American court last week, charged with three counts of indecent assault and battery on a minor, the spectre of the late Scottish cardinal, Keith O‚ÄôBrien, hovered silently over proceedings. Two elderly men, who once donned scarlet robes and mitres, who reached the pinnacle of Catholic church power, stripped to civvies. McCarrick pleaded not guilty to the charges.
O‚ÄôBrien, the UK‚Äôs then most senior Catholic cleric, and a vocal opponent of gay rights, resigned in 2013 after the Observer revealed details of his sexually inappropriate behaviour with priests in his diocese.

In her new memoir the actor claims that a mutual friend was responsible for secretly assisting the suicide of 42-year-old Du Pr√©, who was suffering the serious effects of multiple sclerosis.
It is, Margolyes argues, now her duty to speak out, three decades on, although she knows some readers will question her right to tell such a private story.

                    <span>Research shows that many softened their thinking about helping those in need during Covid but the change of heart didn‚Äôt last
The pandemic has been a shared experience, albeit one we‚Äôve experienced very differently. Those at low risk followed restrictions to protect those in great danger. Billions of pounds were spent protecting those whose livelihoods were threatened.
A Conservative government built new arms of our welfare state overnight, benefiting millions who might never have received benefits before. The country was given a lesson in the reality that individuals‚Äô economic fate often lies out of their hands: just ask the waiters, pilots and hairdressers who were made redundant.

Michael Grecco had low expectations the night he walked into a Boston dive bar known as The Rat. A local punk band was on stage called La Peste ‚Äì appropriately enough ‚Äì but Grecco was more into jazz. It was 1978.
He‚Äôd turned up on a whim, he recalls, figuring a band named after an Albert Camus novel might possibly be interesting. Then the guitar and drums kicked in, and the lead singer launched into a deafening number called Better Off Dead.

                    <span>From Maggie May to Ronnie Kray, crooks have long inspired songs, as a new book proves
In the 1960s when Sir Stephen Sedley, the former appeal court judge, was a young barrister, he successfully defended a number of Travellers in Kent who had been charged under an old law of ‚Äúbeing a Gypsy encamped on a highway‚Äù. Getting the charges thrown out gave him status and an introduction to local singers who taught him some of the songs featured in Who Killed Cock Robin? British Folk Songs of Crime and Punishment, the book he has just co-authored with the musician Martin Carthy.
It explores the origins and history of ancient ballads dealing with the wilder sides of life. There are some familiar songs, such as the Black Velvet Band, which was originally about a young man transported for pickpocketing in Belfast, and there is an 1870 version of Maggie May, who is punished the same way for stealing sailors‚Äô clothes. But what about songs of crime and punishment today?

There is always an eeriness in the archives of days that immediately precede tragedy. The newspapers of the day before the Titanic‚Äôs maiden voyage, or the reports from the eve of President Kennedy‚Äôs visit to Dallas, forever after take on the shadow of innocent, sunlit photos of a suddenly lost loved one. We have come to accept that, 20 years ago this week, on the morning of 11 September, the world as we knew it changed for ever. But from what? What were the immediate befores of that indelible after?
I‚Äôve spent the last few days reading through the papers of the week beginning 3 September 2001, looking for any clues that suggested those were times of relative security and a certain naivety or blitheness, at least in the affluent corners of the west; wondering, with hindsight, if the terrorists‚Äô planes really came out of nowhere, with their era-defining message of hate, as it appeared to so many.

In an open letter, charities including Save the Children, independent campaign groups such as Greenpeace, and the trades union movement, condemn the legislation as ‚Äúan attack on the UK‚Äôs proud democratic tradition and some of our most fundamental rights‚Äù.

Tom Wood took this photograph at Croagh Patrick in County Mayo, Ireland, in 2003. It is said that Saint Patrick spent 40 days fasting at the top of the mountain. For centuries, pilgrims have climbed it in search of succour; in recent years they have frequently been joined by documentary photographers, including Josef Koudelka, Martin Parr and Abbas.
County Mayo is Wood‚Äôs birthplace, and where he grew up. Though he has gone back to the west of Ireland every year since his family left for England in his adolescence, he had never climbed Croagh Patrick, thinking it too touristy. It was Chris Killip, his fellow photographer and friend, who persuaded him to do the walk against his better judgment; it was, he recalls, a bleak, drizzly afternoon and he‚Äôd a bad knee. ‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù he told me last week, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm up there. And just for a few split seconds the light changed. So I made two pictures. And that was one of them.‚Äù

Shortfalls in mental health services and staffing have been flagged as concerns in dozens of inquests since 2015, the Observer can reveal, with coroners issuing repeated warnings over patients facing long waiting lists or falling through gaps in service provision.
The Observer has identified 56 mental health-related deaths in England and Wales from the start of 2015 to the end of 2020 where coroners identified a lack of staffing or service provision as a ‚Äúmatter of concern‚Äù, meaning they believed ‚Äúthere is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken‚Äù.

The question I have reached a point in my life where I am having to make the major commitments expected, like marriage, homeownership and children. Decisions that shape your life. I recently chose to end a relationship and step away from buying a house, though, because I felt unable to commit wholeheartedly. In some ways, it only felt I reached those significant events because it was forced upon me rather than getting excited and choosing for myself. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt take a plunge ‚Äì sometimes I have to, after all I have to live somewhere. But it always seems to be someone else doing the deciding. I just don‚Äôt have any eagerness or desire for anything.
The more I think about it, the more I feel that I have this across my whole life and for all my life. I have a very short-term outlook where I can look forward to small things, like a holiday or starting a new job. But I can‚Äôt look forward to anything that has future implications. I never stay with an employer for a long time, or even commit to a savings plan.

Sagstr√∂m picks up ball too soon and loses hole and match

The smell of cordite fills the Solheim Cup air once more. A contest which has an uncanny knack of throwing up moments of huge controversy has reverted to type in Ohio. Nelly Korda, the world No 1, was the beneficiary of an intervention from rules officialsthat left the European captain Catriona Matthew visibly riled. And no wonder; a key moment had been determined by a stopwatch and a television monitor.
Korda‚Äôs putt for a three on the 13th during the Saturday afternoon fourball session rested agonisingly above the hole. In an obvious bid to speed up play ‚Äì the match in question had earlier been warned over their pace ‚Äì Europe‚Äôs Madelene Sagstr√∂m stepped forward and tossed the ball back to Korda. Cue chaos. Rule 13.3b states: ‚ÄúIf the opponent in match play deliberately lifts or moves the player‚Äôs ball overhanging the hole before the waiting time has ended, the player‚Äôs ball is treated as holed with the previous stroke.‚Äù Sagstr√∂m‚Äôs intervention was after seven seconds; 10 were permitted to Korda as per the rulebook. The incident moved the US to one up in the match, which Korda and Ally Ewing duly won by a single hole.

A former aide to the Prince of Wales has stepped down temporarily from his role as a charity boss while an investigation into allegations about his conduct takes place.
Michael Fawcett, a former assistant valet to Charles, has stepped down as chief executive of the Prince‚Äôs Foundation amid claims about an honour relating to Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz.

Sonia Appleby, 62, was awarded ¬£20,000 after an employment tribunal ruled the NHS‚Äôs Tavistock and Portman trust‚Äôs treatment of her damaged her professional reputation and ‚Äúprevented her from proper work on safeguarding‚Äù.

Lara unable to continue due to cut caused by collision

Josh Warrington had promised that he had to win this fight to keep his professional career alive. In the end not even he, Mauricio Lara or any of the 20,000 supporters inside Headingley Stadium could have envisaged what would happen on a raucous, but ultimately disappointing night in Leeds as the fight was ended by an accidental clash of heads.
This night had been littered with encouragement and optimism for Warrington‚Äôs career moving forwards, not least given the fact he had shown almost unprecedented determination and focus all week in the run-up to this featherweight rematch with Lara in his hometown. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely gutted,‚Äù Warrington said afterwards in what was perhaps a sentiment shared by everyone inside a stadium that has seen so many great sporting moments over the years.

Catalans Dragons made history in the most dramatic fashion with a 31-30 golden-point victory over the champions, St Helens, to clinch the Super League Leaders‚Äô Shield at the Magic Weekend in Newcastle.
The French side came from 30-12 down to draw level after 80 minutes with three converted tries in five minutes and send the game into extra time. The veteran half-back James Maloney, who is retiring at the end of the season, then won the game with a drop goal from 40 metres out eight minutes into extra time to ensure the Perpignan club end in the top spot for the first time.

Jadon Sancho pulls out of squad, Patrick Bamford set for debut

Gareth Southgate has stressed the importance of humility in victory to his England squad and of not angering rival players or crowds as he urged them to seize every moment in the countdown to the Qatar World Cup, beginning with Sunday‚Äôs qualifier against Andorra at Wembley.
The manager was delighted at how his team overcame a hostile atmosphere in Budapest on Thursday to beat Hungary 4-0, one that was blighted by racist chants. But he lingered a little on the much-debated reaction to England‚Äôs first goal, scored by Raheem Sterling, when Declan Rice picked up one of the plastic cups that were thrown down from the stands and pretended to drink from it.

                    <span>BBC Four‚Äôs latest import is a sensationalism-free reimagining of a 1989 Swedish murder case, which trades aspirational design and superhuman sleuths to look deep into societal woes
BBC Four helped kick off Nordic noir‚Äôs British boom in 2008 when it aired the Yellow Bird production of Henning Mankell‚Äôs Wallander series, starring Krister Henriksson as the brooding Swedish detective. There followed The Killing ‚Äì made by Denmark‚Äôs public broadcaster, DR ‚Äì and The Bridge ‚Äì made by DR and Sweden‚Äôs equivalent, SVT ‚Äì plus many lesser imitators. Thirteen years on, though, it‚Äôs another Yellow Bird production, also on BBC Four, which best showcases the genre‚Äôs subtle yet significant evolution. Like everyone else, the Scandinavians have been swapping fictional stories for true crime.
With a scrupulous lack of sensationalism, The Hunt for a Killer dramatises a 15-year investigation into the 1989 murder of 10-year-old Hel√©n Nilsson in H√∂rby, Sweden, over six compelling episodes. Five months after Nilsson‚Äôs disappearance, police find the body of a 26-year-old woman, and must work out whether they‚Äôre looking for a sole perpetrator.

Over the past 12 days in New York, whenever Emma Raducanu has reflected on her startling run to the fourth round at Wimbledon earlier in the summer, she has spoken about how her retirement loss there underlined the need to work on her physicality in order to mix with the top players on the tour.
Few players on the women‚Äôs tour stand as a greater measure of physical preparedness than the tireless Sara Sorribes Tormo of Spain, but on Saturday afternoon Raducanu was as ready as anyone could be: she simply did not let her play. In a faultless exhibition of clean, relentless shotmaking and court sense beyond her years, Raducanu utterly obliterated Sorribes Tormo 6-0, 6-1 to reach the fourth round of the US Open on her debut.

Depending on how you look at it Rohit Sharma‚Äôs first Test century on foreign soil took him about five hours of actual game time, or the 23 hours or so that passed after he first took guard in the glaring late-afternoon sunshine towards the end of day two, or a little under eight years, since he made his debut as a 26-year-old against West Indies in Kolkata in November 2013. Whichever, it was another demonstration that in Test cricket you can never have too much patience, as Sharma will surely have reminded himself when he sent his 256th delivery, the first using the second new ball, steepling to long leg after top-edging a pull shot.
His first 50 had been the slowest of his Test career, taking all of 145 balls, a period of occasional runs but frequent walks. Every batsman develops their own method of mentally resetting between deliveries, and the 34-year-old‚Äôs is unusual not in the time he takes but in the distance he covers.

                    <span>Edgar Wright‚Äôs time-travel film plays like a 60s pop song building towards a big climax
The nostalgia gauge is code-red on Last Night in Soho, a gaudy time-travel romp that whisks its modern-day heroine to a bygone London that probably never existed outside our fevered cultural imagination. It‚Äôs the era of Dusty Springfield and Biba; great music, cool threads. British writer-director Edgar Wright takes a grab-bag of 1960s ingredients, paints them up and makes them dance to his tune. His film is thoroughly silly and stupidly enjoyable. To misquote William Faulkner, the past isn‚Äôt dead, it‚Äôs propping up the bar at the Caf√© de Paris.
‚ÄúYou like that retro style, huh?‚Äù a classmate remarks to Eloise Turner, a 21st-century design student ‚Äì and you can bet your house she does. Eloise is up from deepest Cornwall to attend the London College of Fashion, still haunted by her mother‚Äôs suicide and struggling to find her feet in a city that‚Äôs not like the one she expected. Thomasin McKenzie plays her as your classic fairytale ingenue, guileless and wide-eyed, entirely out of her depth. She‚Äôs eyeing the future but her feet are stuck in the past.

                    <span>Party and union figures urge new policy as Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tells Labour leader: taxing wealth is the fairest way 
The row over how to fund social care threatens to engulf Labour this weekend as Keir Starmer faces pressure from across the party to commit to taxing the wealthy as a way to provide a system fit for the 21st century.
Before the conference season, and as the government prepares to announce within days a hugely controversial increase in national insurance (NI) to fund better care, the TUC leads the charge, calling instead for an increase in capital gains tax (CGT) to meet the costs of reform, and higher wages for care workers.

In a week‚Äôs time, the TUC will hold its 153rd congress in London. Shortly before I get up to give my annual address, a short film will be played of some care workers I met in Middleton, Greater Manchester, this summer.
What they told me about working through the pandemic will always stay with me. Coping without personal protective equipment. The trauma of seeing the people they were caring for ‚Äì and some of their colleagues ‚Äì die from Covid. One care worker, Carol, who supports adults with complex needs, told me: ‚ÄúWe have their lives in our hands 24 hours a day.‚Äù A huge responsibility ‚Äì but Carol earns less than the national minimum wage. It is disgraceful.

                    <span>The travails of the traditional European elite as new money dominated the transfer window suggest things have changed
In times of crisis, the winners are usually the rich. As clubs across Europe continue to struggle against the financial impact of the pandemic, the lesson of this transfer window is that the powerful are mopping up. Or at least they are if they are well-run, which rules out the two Spanish giants and several clubs in Italy.
The transfers of the two players who have defined football for a generation understandably generated great excitement, with fans camping out at the airport in Paris to welcome Lionel Messi and queuing round the block to buy a shirt with his name on the back while Manchester United‚Äôs share price rose by almost 10% on the news of Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs signing before falling back slightly. That will excite executives and seem to vindicate the outlay, although whether those upticks are sustainable enough to pay both players‚Äô vast wages is less certain.

A senior Conservative MP is demanding an immediate end to the ‚Äúunseemly and unprofessional‚Äù row between the foreign and defence secretaries over Afghanistan, warning that it is further damaging the UK‚Äôs already battered reputation on the world stage.
Writing for the Observer Tobias Ellwood, chair of the Commons select committee on defence, says the crisis has exposed the weakness of the UK as a global player, and calls for a complete overhaul of the way foreign policy is handled in Whitehall.

Parents should choose whether they allow their children to be vaccinated against Covid-19 if ministers overrule scientific advice against mass vaccination of healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, the government‚Äôs independent vaccine advisers have said.
The government is set to push ahead with vaccinations for teenagers but Professor Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said on Saturday that it was ‚Äúentirely up to parents‚Äù to decide.

No one seems as defeated as the global warming ‚Äúdeniers‚Äù who dominated rightwing thinking a decade ago. Like late 18th-century opponents of abolishing the slave trade, Lord Lawson and the claque of Conservative cranks who filled the comment pages of the Tory press are remembered today as dangerous fools ‚Äì assuming they are remembered at all.
The billions of dollars spent by the fossil fuel industry on propaganda and its acceptance by know-nothing elements on the right caused incalculable damage. They might have followed Margaret Thatcher, who warned in 1989 of C02 admissions leading to climate change ‚Äúmore fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known‚Äù. The desire of business to protect profits and the vanity of politicians and pundits, who saw themselves as dissidents fighting the consensus rather than fanatics enabling destruction, helped to waste two decades of valuable time.

                    <span>The South African novelist on making a pilgrimage to Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs home, his youth in apartheid-era Pretoria and being shortlisted twice for the Booker prize
Novelist and playwright Damon Galgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, at the height of the apartheid era. He wrote his first novel aged 17 and has twice been shortlisted for the Booker prize. His latest, The Promise, spans four tumultuous decades as it traces the afterlife of a white matriarch‚Äôs dying wish to bequeath property to her black servant. The novel is heavily tipped to land him a place on this year‚Äôs shortlist when it‚Äôs announced on 14 September. He lives in Cape Town.
How did The Promise originate?
Books tend to build up out of clusters of ideas or themes that you carry around for a while and worry at. The specific form of this book crystallised around a series of anecdotes that a friend told me when we had a semi-drunken lunch, about four family funerals he‚Äôd attended. It occurred to me that would be quite an interesting way to tell the story of one particular family. The promise itself also arrived from a friend, who was telling me how his mother had asked the family to give a certain piece of land to the black woman who had looked after her through her last illness, as it happens in the book.

                    <span>A 1943 melodrama offers one of the best portraits of a single woman Hollywood ever drew
Out in the world again, I‚Äôve seen a lot of new exhibitions and a bit of new theatre, the heart going out to those actors who, in spite of great reviews, are still taking curtain calls to the sound of too few hands clapping. But in the end, the cultural highlight of my summer had nothing at all to do with novelty. At a BFI cinema on London‚Äôs South Bank, I saw Old Acquaintance, a melodrama of 1943 starring Bette Davis, and thought, not for the first time, of a line by the film critic, E Arnot Robertson, who wrote in Picture Post: ‚ÄúI think Bette Davis would have been burned at the stake as a witch if she had lived three or four hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet.‚Äù
The BFI‚Äôs Bette Davis season, now sadly over, was bliss: an embarrassment of riches to be enjoyed in the velvety dark, preferably with a surreptitious hip flask of something strong (the bars are still closed). But what to choose? Old Acquaintance, which is about the love-hate relationship between two women who‚Äôve been friends since childhood (Miriam Hopkins co-stars) is a pretty awful movie, the high-tide mark of the ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs picture‚Äù of the 1940s. But I love it for two reasons. The first is that, in Davis‚Äôs character, a writer called Kit Marlowe, we have one of the most sympathetic portraits Hollywood ever drew of the single woman. The second is for Davis herself, who turns in a performance so extravagantly good, she might be in a different film altogether. The patrician voice. The oyster eyes. The sheer command of every emotion from yearning to ambition. On the way home, my jaw ached: the effect of having spent almost two hours with it wide open in amazement.

Of all the political posters and billboards that line the streets of German towns and cities this late summer, the ones most likely to stop commuters in their tracks are those bathed in traffic-light red.
Using a stark colour scheme usually exclusive to the Marxist-Leninist parties on the fringe of the German left, the posters are surprising in more ways than one: in the centre of the picture sits a bald, suited man who looks less like a leftwing rabble-rouser promising you radical change than a middle manager at a regional building society scrutinising your loan application.

There was a time when buying ‚Äúfresh pasta‚Äù simply meant picking up a pack of dry spaghetti rather than a tin from the shelf.
Just a few decades on and a revolution in our understanding of Italian food has brought pesto, tortellini, polenta and even pasta flour into British homes. It is a change in kitchen habits that is in large part the legacy of one man: Antonio Carluccio.

Ministers are facing a fortnight of showdowns with peers over weak post-Brexit green protections just weeks before the Cop26 summit on the environment.
An alliance of crossbench and opposition peers has tabled more than 100 amendments to the environment bill in an attempt to beef up protections for nature, air quality and water standards and give the new green watchdog more powers.

                    <span>Ten years after village doc Le Quattro Volte, Michelangelo Frammartino returns with an observational piece centring on a deep-cave system in Calabria
In 2011 Italian artist Michelangelo Frammartino scored a small indie hit with a film called Le Quattro Volte, a metaphysical study of a mountain village that featured bleating goats and ringing bells, charcoal burners and Roman centurions. Le Quattro Volte was odd and gentle and by and large people loved it. I‚Äôm not sure how much money one earns from a small indie hit. Probably enough to pay for a weekend break in Tropea. Now Frammartino is back ‚Äì 10 years later, not wanting to rush things ‚Äì with the lovely Il Buco, another film that is content to saunter on the wild side, gazing at woods and sky, rocks and trees and identifying a serene, quiet heaven in everything that it sees. It‚Äôs not quite a documentary, yet nor is it exactly a narrative feature. It lives alone; the cinematic equivalent of a hermit on a mountaintop.
Frammartino‚Äôs last film was inspired by Pythagoras. This one takes its prompt from a 1961 potholing expedition in Calabria, mapping out a labyrinthine cave system which was confirmed at the time as the third deepest in the world. The film shows the cavers descending its slick twists and turns and uncovering an old photo and a damp magazine with JFK on the cover. Whatever item slips into the crevasse instantly becomes history, or a lost memory; a teasing remnant of the people who once walked above.

More than 1,000 of these pieces of precision-designed aerodynamic steel, each about 80 metres long, have been shipped across the water from a factory on the Isle of Wight. Owned by Danish energy giant MHI Vestas, it employs almost 700 people on the island and usually produces seven blades a week.

Being a parent can feel, at times, like leading an authoritarian nation of one. You control what your subject can read, who they can speak to and what they can do; you deal with periodic revolts against your rule and occasionally engage in a simulacrum of democratic decision-making while knowing that you control the outcome.
But for all that authoritarian leaders like to present themselves as a parental figure for the country at large, it‚Äôs rare that they actually get involved with the day-to-day work of, well, parenting. Which is why the news that China is taking on the job of limiting gaming time caught the attention of so many parents I know.

Before the pandemic, every morning and night was a cycle of stress and rushing around for single mother Emma Woodburn, getting her two young sons to and from school, childcare before and after work and staying on top of housework.
But when, 18 months ago, the 39-year-old from Lancashire was told by her employer she could work from home, everything changed. ‚ÄúIt was like a weight was lifted. It was less rush in the morning. I could put the washing on throughout the day and hang it out on my dinner break. It just felt easier.‚Äù

                    <span>Marvel‚Äôs latest blockbuster is an electrifying fusion of convincing characters and breathtaking CGI
Although it often feels as though barely a month passes without another comic book movie puffed as a new pinnacle of achievement for the superhero genre, it‚Äôs vanishingly rare for a film to actually deserve its hype. But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does so, and more. Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, is canny enough to realise that the key to success with an effects-driven, eye-popping extravaganza is not the CGI spectacle, it‚Äôs the basic stuff. Textured characters. Karaoke and shots-fuelled friendships. And electrifyingly badass fight choreography.
In the goofy exchanges between Simu Liu‚Äôs Shaun (heir to his father‚Äôs tricky relationship with power, and his mother‚Äôs fierce empathy) and his best friend, defender, drinking buddy and fellow valet car-parker Katy (Awkwafina), the film is already one of the freshest Marvel pictures in a long time. And that‚Äôs before the fight on a runaway bus featuring an eastern European man mountain with a laser arm prosthesis.

                    <span>Charlie Gilmour never wanted to have children ‚Äì his father had abandoned him at six months and he feared he‚Äôd do the same. But then a magpie came into his life and changed everything
It wasn‚Äôt long after our wedding ‚Äì on our New Forest honeymoon, in fact ‚Äì that my partner gently raised the prospect of having children. On paper, the moment couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect. Down a deer track, through a thicket of waist-high ferns, we‚Äôd discovered a clearing of sweetly scented camomile. Everything around us was bursting with life: pheasant cocks scurrying through the undergrowth; resin dripping indecently from the clefts of the evergreens. But off paper, it felt as if all the sap had been sucked from the scene. Babies, as far as I was concerned, were like unexploded bombs, at once fragile and potentially devastating. Certainly best left for the experts to handle.
Brephophobia is the fear of babies. My particular version of it had roots in my own infancy. My biological father had, as far as I could tell, been broken by a baby and he seemed, in many ways, a more capable man than me. When Heathcote and my mum Polly met in the late 1980s, he was on the brink of becoming a bestselling poet with his epic Whale Nation ‚Äì although that wasn‚Äôt the only string to his bow. He was a playwright, tipped by Pinter and Burroughs; an actor beloved of Derek Jarman; a radical housing activist who‚Äôd helped found the Independent State of Frestonia, sheltering the homeless; and an accomplished magician who used his conjuring abilities to rob Harrods.

                    <span>As number of victims updated from six to seven, police say ‚Äòevery legal avenue‚Äô was explored to try to contain threat of attack
Seven people were injured in the Islamic State-inspired terror attack in New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern has said, updating initial reports that only six people had been hurt.
Speaking at a media conference in Wellington on Saturday, New Zealand‚Äôs prime minister said that of the seven injured, five were in hospital, and three of them were in a critical condition.

                    <span>The comedian, 60, talks about growing up wild in the Black Country, marrying her on-screen grandson and finally being able to be a grumpy old woman
My childhood was unusual, an Indian family plonked in the middle of the Black Country. I was a Midlands wench outside the house ‚Äì climbing trees, running wild ‚Äì and a good Indian girl at home. The duality was great for my spirit, a common story for the children of Indian immigrants. Always swapping masks ‚Äì both inside and out of the experience ‚Äì gave us this third eye, a perfect preparation for creative life.
Dad lived through the partition of India and Pakistan. At 13, he saw appalling things no child should see. His life was ripped apart with a random line drawn by a lawyer in London. He fled to a refugee camp with only the clothes on his back. This might have made some people bitter, but my father was empathic, loving and wise. Seeing the worst of humanity made him want to be the best of it instead.

                    <span>The Theranos saga is depressing, but there is one silver lining: the preoccupation with the #girlboss is dead, and Holmes helped kill it
A brown man made her do it! Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of blood-testing startup Theranos, was once seen as a maverick thinker and a fearless feminist icon. Now that she is standing trial for fraud, however, she‚Äôs set to argue that she bears no responsibility for her actions: she was completely under the control of her ex-boyfriend and former Theranos executive Ramesh ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù Balwani. According to court filings, Holmes‚Äôs lawyers will argue that Balwani, who was almost 20 years older than Holmes, emotionally and sexually abused her. Holmes‚Äôs lawyers write in the court filings that she was the victim of a ‚Äúpattern of abuse and coercive control‚Äù that essentially ‚Äúerased her capacity to make decisions‚Äù.

The komodo dragon, the world‚Äôs largest lizard, is threatened with extinction as rising water levels driven by the climate crisis shrink its habitat, according to the latest ‚Äúred list‚Äù update.
Endemic to a handful of Indonesian islands, the komodo dragon lives on the edge of forest or in open savannah, rarely venturing higher than 700 metres above sea level. Rising water levels are set to affect 30% of its habitat in the next 45 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has changed its status from vulnerable to endangered.

                    <span>I have never been seriously ill or spent a night in hospital, but I‚Äôm plagued by fears that a terrible sickness is coming for me. How did I fall victim to health anxiety?
‚ÄúThis minute I was well, and am ill, this minute.‚Äù The pain arrives slowly, like a Polaroid sharpening into view, but the fear comes suddenly: a channel switched, a cloud sped across the sun. It‚Äôs June 1989, I recently turned 20, and I am supposed to be studying for first-year exams in English, at University College Dublin. Instead, I‚Äôm letting a morning‚Äôs MTV binge slide into the afternoon and paying keen attention to the fingers of my right hand, which have begun to ache. In the days that follow ‚Äì though I only half believe it‚Äôs happening ‚Äì stiffness spreads to my wrist and elbow, to the other arm, to my hips and knees. I start hobbling, and hunch over on the bus on my way to university. I will have to repeat some exams, but my affliction will have vanished by midsummer, walked off one hot day in St Stephen‚Äôs Green.
Most of my life, from early adolescence onwards, has been punctuated by these episodes, more or less alarming, depending on my symptoms and the disease I have decided is expressed there. Fretful interludes have remained secret, never spoken about to parents, friends or professionals. Others have been, or felt, dramatic: the shock of a sudden lump, rash or pain must be taken to a GP, then to specialists, only to be quickly dismissed, or dissolved in the weeks-long agony of appointments and results. Still others have lingered for months or even years, dragging at daily life, relationships, career prospects.

Schoolchildren should be given the Covid vaccine to avoid allowing the virus to ‚Äúrun through the population‚Äù, a leading scientific expert has said, after official vaccine advisers concluded the net health benefit in vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds was too small.
On Friday, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) stopped short of a recommending vaccinating healthy 12- to 15-year-olds against Covid, saying ‚Äúthe margin of benefit is considered too small‚Äù to support universal vaccination.

In an effort to burn off toxic chemicals before and after Hurricane Ida, many industrial facilities sent the gases through smoke stacks topped with flares.
But the hurricane blew out some of those flares like candles, allowing harmful pollution into the air.

Sometimes, Richard Osman tells me, complete strangers shout the words ‚ÄúHelen Mirren‚Äù at him in the street. He is tickled, but wonders what other passersby make of it. If they have read one of the million-plus copies that Osman‚Äôs debut novel, The Thursday Murder Club, has sold, and if they are as good at lateral thinking as the book‚Äôs quartet of senior amateur detectives, they may work out that Mirren is a fantasy casting suggestion for Elizabeth, the ex-spook whose capacity for deductive logic takes centre stage in the next book in the series, The Man Who Died Twice.
Elizabeth is a corker of a character: mysterious, steely, aware not only of what‚Äôs going on around her, but uncannily tuned in to what‚Äôs about to happen too. In her crime-fighting exploits, she‚Äôs assisted by three neighbours in her retirement community in the Kent-Sussex borderlands: former rabble-rousing trade unionist Ron; his best pal Ibrahim, a psychiatrist; and Joyce, a cake-baking retired nurse on the constant lookout for love. Joyce‚Äôs diary entries ‚Äì with a touch of Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett‚Äôs bathetic, quotidian humour about them ‚Äì punctuate the novels‚Äô third-person narration.

September‚Äôs a month that always feels a bit like a new term, whether or not you‚Äôre packing the kids back to school. Memories of school carry, for many, the not-always-sweet smell of overcooked cabbage, but that can be easily set right. Cabbage is just one member of the brassica family whose leaves, flowers, stems and roots can all be eaten ‚Äì think broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, hispi ‚Ä¶ The solution to that familiar school corridor smell is not to overcook it and to balance it with something creamy (such as yoghurt) or sweet (such as coconut). So there we go: the first lesson of the new term and, I hope, some delicious recipes to set everyone on their September way.

                    <span>That your life becomes entirely about your kids once you have them is not proof that‚Äôs how life should be
I am of an age when most of my social group is in their late 30s and early 40s, and, as has always been the case, the majority of my friends are women. So I find myself increasingly having this conversation ‚Äì usually with a friend, but sometimes with a nice woman I bond with at a party or somesuch ‚Äì and it goes like this: she always assumed she would have kids, but she didn‚Äôt meet the right partner in her 30s, and actually it was fine because she was so busy with her career, and who can afford kids anyway? But now she‚Äôs 40 and while she‚Äôs not desperate to have kids, she‚Äôs also not that keen on losing the option. It kinda sucks being the only one among her friends without kids, when the WhatsApps are full of Hey Duggee chat, and what will happen to her when she‚Äôs old? Will she be all alone? So should she have a baby now? I look her right in the eyes and I tell her what I always tell women in these circumstances: don‚Äôt bother.
I need to clarify two things here. First, this is in no way a reflection of my feelings about my own children, whom I genuinely cannot imagine my life without, even though I lived for almost 40 years without them. That your life becomes entirely about your kids once you have them is not proof that‚Äôs how life should be ‚Äì it‚Äôs a reflection of what kids are like. It‚Äôs strange how often people confuse the cause and effect here. I can only assume it‚Äôs done mainly by parents who are trying to reassure themselves that they definitely made the right life choices when they realise that, for the next eight years, their weekends will no longer be about seeing their friends, but consist entirely and only of shepherding their kids to playdates and making awkward small chat with random people who just happened to have had kids around the same time as you.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄòPeople try to stop us speaking up‚Äô ‚Äì Jolie meets inspirational young campaigners
Angelina Jolie sits at a desk, back straight as a rule and rather regal. Her features are cartoonishly beautiful ‚Äì straight black hair, vertiginous cheekbones, huge blue eyes and lips like a plumped red sofa. She is talking on Zoom to four young activists. It is a horribly apt day to be discussing human rights ‚Äì the Taliban has just captured Ghazni city on its approach to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.
If this were a movie, you might suspect Jolie was playing a divine leader addressing the fortunate few. Yet it soon becomes apparent that things aren‚Äôt quite as they seem. The actor and film director is the one in awe, not the activists. The young people talk about the work they have done raising awareness of the carnage in Syria, the environmental crisis, trans rights and food poverty. Jolie hangs on their every word. She tells them they have inspired her children who follow their work, warns them against burnout, apologises for the failings of her generation and says how honoured she is to meet them.

In 1981, David ‚ÄúSyd‚Äù Lawrence played his debut season for Gloucestershire ‚Äì a big deal for a 17-year-old, who had inherited his cricketing passion from his Jamaican father. He was sitting in his hotel room during his first away game when there was a knock at the door. He opened it to find a banana skin outside, left there by one of his own teammates. ‚ÄúAnd I just remember shutting the door‚Ä¶‚Äù says Lawrence.
That‚Äôs all the former England bowler manages, for a long while. The pain of the memory has sandbagged him, and he needs time to recover. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he says eventually. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard when you relive this.‚Äù

                    <span>With my brother-in-law‚Äôs group, nobody seemed to care how little I‚Äôd helped on the headwind
I‚Äôve done enough group cycling in my life to say this with authority: it‚Äôs impossible for someone at my level, which is to say competent but not a grafter. Cycling clubs tend to be wonderfully inclusive and will meet you wherever you are (metaphorically speaking; literally, you have to meet them wherever they are, which is usually at the top of a really big hill). Whatever it takes, they‚Äôll wait for you. Consequently, even on a leisure ride, a portion will be spent in profound embarrassment that some poor schmuck has to hang back for you. So you go a bit too fast, and the embarrassment commingles with cardiac discomfort until your face and every other part of you is bright red. The alternative is the complete beginner‚Äôs ride, with someone well-meaning explaining how to indicate.
I solved this by hitching my apple wagon to my brother-in-law‚Äôs mishmash of a group; so informal that they‚Äôre unbranded, so fit that they cycle in France (the hilly bits), but ‚Äì here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äì so nature-loving, so whimsical, that they will stop for anything. They‚Äôll stop if they see an unseasonably large toad. They‚Äôll stop for a baby owl, or a field of poppies rolling across the eyeline like a red rash. I, too, would like to stop for these things, but it‚Äôs a chance for me to catch up, which I grab with both hands.

On the morning of 11 September 2001, an 18-year-old was driving his white Honda Civic on the way to work as a freelance web designer. It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland‚Äôs Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day.
Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington.

Champion joins call for para athletics in non-disabled meets

Hannah Cockroft slashed her hand on the wheel of her chair on Saturday morning. She was unable to get stitches because it was too close to her race, which took place on a slippery surface under the pouring rain. Still, no bother. Cockroft duly entered the arena of the Olympic Stadium and left the field in the T34 800m for dead, claiming her seventh Paralympic gold medal in the process, and only just missing out on her own world record. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely gutted,‚Äù she revealed afterwards, with a smile.
Depending on the angle you viewed the race from, it was possible to think that Cockroft was out on the track alone, so great was the distance between herself and the rest of the field. She won in a Paralympic record time, despite sodden conditions in the Olympic Stadium.

Under the plan put forward by Great Britain‚Äôs energy regulator, electric vehicle drivers could earn money by effectively transforming their cars into mobile power plants by releasing power back to the energy network when demand on the electricity grid reaches a peak.

Weight gained during the pandemic is putting more people at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, with those seeking weight loss help from the health service heavier on average than before the start of the coronavirus crisis, according to an NHS study.
People asking for weight-loss help are on average 2.27kg (5lbs) heavier than those starting the programme during the previous three years, the research reveals.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

Boris Johnson‚Äôs former director of communications has blamed a lack of expertise in Whitehall for the government‚Äôs struggle to get its message across in the early days of the Covid crisis.
Lee Cain was a key adviser to Johnson, who boasted about shaking hands on a hospital visit, claimed the government could ‚Äúturn the tide‚Äù within 12 weeks, and said it would be ‚Äúinhuman‚Äù to cancel Christmas, days before ordering millions of people to spend the festive season at home.

Long before the name MƒÅnuka became synonymous with a booming honey industry, celebrity endorsements and protracted global disputes, it was known in MƒÅori legend. After TƒÅne Mahuta, the god of forests, separated his parents from their locked embrace, he set out to cloak Papat≈´ƒÅnuku (his earth mother) in trees. One of these trees, born from his union with Tawake-Toro, was the MƒÅnuka, with its dense, spiky foliage, delicate white flowers and unique pollen.
MƒÅnuka is considered a taonga, or treasure, of which MƒÅori are considered the kaitiaki (guardians). The legend, and the MƒÅori relationship to MƒÅnuka, has become an important tool in a global battle to protect Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs MƒÅnuka honey brand, the most bitter part of which is between New Zealand and Australia.

If Irish eyes are smiling come Saturday lunchtime in Toledo, one of golf‚Äôs supreme forces will have been vanquished. Leona Maguire, on her Solheim Cup debut, has been tasked with taking down the Korda sisters. Maguire, the first player from Ireland to compete in this biennial event, will team up with Mel Reid in match three of the foursomes session. Nelly and Jessica Korda, the stars of the US show even in defeat at Gleneagles two years ago, lie in wait. Maguire articulated her thoughts on the showdown ‚Äì including a touch of psychological warfare ‚Äì with the confidence of a veteran.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited,‚Äù said Maguire. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously their golden pairing. There‚Äôs going to be a huge amount of pressure on them. Both myself and Mel are fighters, we will give it absolutely everything we have.

For a fleeting moment Mason Mount felt vulnerable. The England midfielder sensed what was coming. He had set up Raheem Sterling for the breakthrough goal in the 55th minute of the 4-0 World Cup qualifying win over Hungary, the Puskas Arena in Budapest was gripped by pin-drop silence ‚Äì a strange sensation ‚Äì and the England players were celebrating towards one of the corner flags. They were by the end that housed the Carpathian Brigade, the hardcore group of Hungary supporters who dress in black shirts.

To reach Nakida village in the highlands of Fiji, Dr Losalini Tabakei and her colleagues hiked for hours, up and down mountains, through forests, down muddy slopes, across rivers and along treacherous ridges with steep slopes of bamboo forest on either side.
Their supplies ‚Äì clothing, medical equipment and, crucially, the Covid-19 vaccines they were bringing to administer to the remote community of just 60 people ‚Äì were sent separately on horseback; the vaccines in refrigerated boxes, the rest in bags wrapped in plastic. The horses took the longer but flatter route to the town along the river.

                    <span>Maggie Gyllenhaal‚Äôs accomplished directing debut makes humid, sensual cinema of Ferrante‚Äôs novel
Olivia Colman gives a powerhouse turn in The Lost Daughter, prickly and combustible as Leda Caruso, a middle-aged languages professor on a working holiday in Greece. In flight from her past, possibly from herself, she stares at the sea as though it‚Äôs done her a great wrong and eats alone at the bar, repelling anyone who draws close. She haunts the resort like a ghost while other ghosts are haunting her.
In her excellent directing debut, Maggie Gyllenhaal conjures Elena Ferrante‚Äôs 2008 source novel into humid, sensual cinema: a captivating miniature, full of telling details and little dramas writ large. The likes of Ed Harris, Dakota Johnson and Paul Mescal provide The Lost Daughter with an impressive Greek chorus. But this is Colman‚Äôs stage and her tragedy. You can‚Äôt take your eyes off her for a second.

For some time during its initial 51-year run, A Question of Sport (BBC One) had a round called What Happened Next?, which saw footage from a game freeze-framed, and the ex-players on the panel asked to predict the outcome. It was usually a dog or a streaker running on, or the ball bouncing off the ref into the net.
In future quizzes on TV, panellists may find it hard to believe that, when Sue Barker was dropped as presenter of A Question of Sport after 24 years, what happened next was that comedian and dating show host Paddy McGuinness moved into her chair. After Barker, David Coleman and David Vine, this is the first time the show has been fronted by someone who isn‚Äôt a serving BBC sports broadcaster.

In a move that highlights a growing divide between government and scientific advisers over the next phase of the vaccination programme, ministers will seek extra evidence which may help overturn the watchdog‚Äôs verdict.

Dune reminds us what a Hollywood blockbuster can be.

Adapted from Frank Herbert‚Äôs 60s opus, Dune is dense, moody and quite often sublime ‚Äì the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse. Encountering it here was like stumbling across some fabulous lost tribe, or a breakaway branch of America‚Äôs founding fathers who laid out the template for a different and better New World.

                    <span>A plan to split the proceeds of a national insurance rise between the NHS and social care could worsen intergenerational injustice
An announcement on social care funding is imminent, with a national insurance rise the probable outcome. But what ought to be unambiguously good news, after years of delay, is not. Far from being the best solution to a problem regarded as intractable only because governments do not want to pay for it, the proposal to raise up to ¬£10bn a year from extra NI contributions is closer to the worst.
 The current impasse is untenable, not least because of the burden it places on the NHS. The difficulties created for hospitals by the lack of suitable social care arrangements have been documented for years. With the health service facing unprecedented pent-up demand as another autumn-winter season of Covid and its knock-on effects approaches, ministers know they have to do something if they are not to risk a wave of public wrath.

                    <span>The shadow of the departing chancellor looms over a contest too close to call
In September 1998, when a relatively youthful Gerhard Schr√∂der defeated Helmut Kohl and ended his 16-year reign as German chancellor, the victorious leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) told supporters that the country had opted for ‚Äúa change of generation‚Äù. Mr Schr√∂der‚Äôs triumph turned a page on the cold war era, aligning Germany with a fresh-faced centre-left resurgence in western democracies led by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. It was, in the political vernacular, a quintessential ‚Äúchange‚Äù election.
Almost a quarter of a century later, Angela Merkel will stand down of her own accord later this month ‚Äì the first chancellor to do so ‚Äì after equalling Mr Kohl‚Äôs longevity in office. But this time, ahead of a 26 September election, German voters seem to be somewhat reluctant to move on. None of Ms Merkel‚Äôs prospective replacements come close to matching her popularity. Fewer than one in five see the chancellor‚Äôs own preferred successor, the CDU/CSU candidate, Armin Laschet, as the best option to replace her. Caught on camera laughing during a visit to a town devastated by floods, Mr Laschet has fought a lacklustre campaign and has become a liability for his party. A poll last week found that from highs of around 35% at the start of the year, the CDU/CSU‚Äôs ratings have plunged on Mr Laschet‚Äôs watch to the low twenties and fallen just behind the SPD for the first time since 2006. The Greens electrified the contest by topping polls in the spring. Their extraordinary surge seemed to embody a widespread desire for a more environmentally driven politics to meet net zero pledges. But they too have lost their mojo as the party‚Äôs candidate for chancellor, the inexperienced Annalena Baerbock, struggles to recover from allegations of plagiarism and financial mismanagement.

On his last proper album, 2018‚Äôs Scorpion, Drake showed signs of maturing. While musically it was a mixed bag, the record found the Canadian superstar grappling with fatherhood ‚Äì a fact unwittingly revealed to the public in a diss track by rival Pusha T. Ending with March 14, a song that drew comparisons between his oft-discussed experience as a child of divorce and his disappointment at now being a single parent himself, it hinted that a man known as one of music‚Äôs most egregious navel-gazers may have emerged enlightened and self-aware.

Emma Raducanu was in the process of tearing through yet another higher ranked opponent on Thursday, establishing a 6-2, 4-0 lead against Zhang Shuai in the second round of the US Open, when the experienced Chinese player began to pull her back down to earth. As Zhang landed blows and harassed the Raducanu forehand, the rallies lengthened and the intensity became more pronounced.
It was at Wimbledon two months ago that the match intensity against another top-100 player, Ajla Tomljanovic, proved too much for Raducanu, leading to her retirement from their fourth round match due to breathing problems. But here she adjusted well and closed off the match 6-2, 6-4, clinching match point by winning the final attritional exchange.

An Iranian tanker carrying fuel bound for Lebanon was at anchor in the Red Sea on Friday ahead of the final leg of a voyage to Syria, which is set to pose the biggest test yet to US sanctions imposed on two arch regional foes.
The tanker is expected in the Syrian port of Baniyas early next week, in defiance of US sanctions that prevent oil exports from Iran and imports to Syria, which have both been subject to stringent US-imposed restrictions on trade. The imminent arrival is being hailed by the Lebanese militant group turned political bloc, Hezbollah, as a sanctions-busting solution for an energy crisis that has brought Lebanon to a standstill and led to widespread blackouts.

                    <span>Sadly, blending in for a quiet life remains a necessary survival strategy for far too many people in Britain today
It is impossible to know how much of the surge in reported hate crimes against LGBTQ people is due to escalating harassment and violence, and how much is down to the increased willingness of victims to inform the authorities. What we do know that is that recorded homophobic and transphobic hate crimes have jumped every year since 2015, and yet with an estimated four in five still going unreported, the already grisly figures only hint at a far bleaker reality.
The incidents vary in nature and severity: from abuse hurled at someone identified as LGBTQ because of their appearance, or mannerisms, or a fleeting or profound show of affection towards a partner; to gay men being beaten and robbed, as happened in a suspected homophobic attack on the streets of Edinburgh last month, or a trans man savagely attacked in Bournemouth earlier this year. ‚ÄúAccording to our research, many experienced verbal harassment, physical abuse, threatening messages, and damage to property,‚Äù says Eloise Stonborough of the LGBTQ civil rights organisation Stonewall.

                    <span>Labour should seize the opportunity to make the case for alternative ways of funding social care
The Conservative government is reported to be considering an increase of up to 1.25p in the pound in national insurance contributions from 26 million people in work to help cover the costs of patching up Britain‚Äôs crumbling social care system. The party hopes that the win of ‚Äúsolving‚Äù the social care crisis will outweigh the political betrayal of breaking a clear manifesto promise to freeze national insurance. But the funding option proposed is unfair, with those in work expected to subsidise elderly rich people. If Labour is sharp, it can win a big political victory here ‚Äì and show itself to be the party with the fair, long-term solutions to a crisis a decade in the making.
The Conservatives have floated Labour‚Äôs 2002 increase in NICs as a precedent, with the public reaction at the time rather muted. But circumstances were very different. Labour did not breach a manifesto promise to push through its 1p increase. Real wages and salaries in 2002 had been rising for a decade. And the NICs rise was brought in to pay for the National Health Service.

                    <span>Unclear when or if presenter will return to station he founded, as GB News plans for relaunch
Fresh doubt has been cast over Andrew Neil‚Äôs continued involvement in GB News as it emerged he will not be making his expected return next week to work at the station he founded.
Amid frayed relations between Neil and executives running the station, the former Sky anchor Colin Brazier said on Twitter on Friday that he would once again be in the presenting chair of his colleague‚Äôs show on Monday.

As yet another generation of Afghans fled their homeland over the past fortnight, one song has resonated as a poignant anthem for the exodus.
My Homeland ‚Äì Sarzamin i Man in Farsi ‚Äì was written in 1998 by the singer Dawood Sarkhosh, who himself had to leave Afghanistan in the civil war that erupted following the Soviet withdrawal.

A great glute-strengthening exercise that particularly benefits desk-bound lower backs; it will also improve hip mobility, which can get too tight when you‚Äôre sitting for too long.

                    <span>Readers respond to an editorial about understanding quantum theory and defining the laws of physics
Your editorial on quantum physics (30 August) starts with a quote from Richard Feynman ‚Äì ‚Äúnobody understands quantum mechanics‚Äù ‚Äì and then says ‚Äúthat is no longer true‚Äù. One of us (Norman Dombey) was taught quantum theory by Feynman at Caltech; the other (John Charap) was taught by Paul Dirac at Cambridge. Quantum theory was devised by several physicists including Dirac, Erwin Schr√∂dinger and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s and 1930s, and Dirac made their work relativistic.
It is absurd to say that quantum mechanics is now understood whereas it was not 50 years ago. There have of course been advances in our understanding of quantum phenomena, but the conceptual framework of quantum physics remains as it was. The examples you give of nuclear plants, medical scans and lasers involve straightforward applications of quantum mechanics that were understood 50 years ago.

Dominic Raab has been reluctant to criticise Joe Biden, who has faced an unprecedented wave of criticism over the US exit from Afghanistan, partly because he always saw the decision as inevitable, and partly because in principle he instinctively sympathises with it.
The foreign secretary is trying to position the UK as close as possible to the Biden administration, even though the criticism of the US president continues unabated from former British diplomats, politicians, security chiefs and military figures.

Apple will delay its plans to begin scanning user images for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) before uploading them to the cloud, the company says, after a backlash from privacy groups.
The company‚Äôs proposal, first revealed in August, involved a new technique it had developed called ‚Äúperceptual hashing‚Äù to compare photos with known images of child abuse when users opted to upload them to the cloud. If the company detected enough matches, it would manually review the images, before flagging the user account to law enforcement.

After months of havering, the government is poised to make two big announcements in the coming weeks. Both break manifesto pledges, both are fraught with political danger.
First, perhaps as early as next week, comes the long-awaited plan for social care, expected to be funded by an increase in national insurance contributions. That breaks the pledge made in 2019 not to raise income tax, VAT or NI. Then, in the next month or so there is likely to be an announcement that the state pension will not rise in line with the expected 8% rise in earnings this year. That breaks the pension triple lock: an annual uprate of 2.5%, annual inflation or earnings depending on which is the highest.

                    <span>Kristen Stewart‚Äôs entirely compelling Di has no escape from the dress-up game of monarchy in Pablo Larra√≠n‚Äôs unreverential movie
Sandringham, Christmas 1991. Bare trees, frosted fields, dead pheasants on the drive. Inside the grand house the dining table has been laid in readiness, but one of the principal guests ‚Äì arguably the main course ‚Äì is running late and lost. She grinds her car to a halt, tosses her perfect hair in frustration. ‚ÄúWhere the fuck am I?‚Äù asks Diana, Princess of Wales.
And so begins this extraordinary film, which bills itself as ‚Äúa fable from a true tragedy‚Äù and spotlights three days in the dissolution of Charles and Di‚Äôs marriage. Working off a sharp script by Steven Knight, Chilean director Pablo Larra√≠n spins the headlines and scandals into a full-blown Gothic nightmare, an opulent ice palace of a movie with shades of Rebecca at the edges and a pleasing bat-squeak of absurdity in its portrayal of the royals. Larra√≠n‚Äôs approach to the material is rich and intoxicating and altogether magnificent. I won‚Äôt call it majestic. That would do this implicitly republican film a disservice.

Two singles released from Abba‚Äôs first album in 40 years have raced to the top of the streaming charts, in a comeback that has generated praise and excitement among fans who remember the original releases and a new younger audience.
The first two singles from Abba‚Äôs forthcoming album, to be released on 5 November, were in first and third place on YouTube‚Äôs trending rankings in 12 countries on Friday, including the UK. I Still Have Faith In You gained 4.4m views within 24 hours in Britain and Don‚Äôt Shut Me Down 1.4m views. 
In a further confirmation of the Scandinavian pop band‚Äôs cross-generational appeal, Abba have already amassed 991,000 followers and 5.5m likes on TikTok despite only joining the platform on 1 September.

Mara Clarke is the founder of Abortion Support Network

The state of Texas now has the most restrictive abortion law to be passed in the US since Roe v Wade legalised abortion in 1973. Texas residents must now add out-of-state travel to the many barriers that already exist to getting an abortion. There has been an outpouring of support for Texas women from people in the UK and European Union, but it‚Äôs worth remembering that while the UK and Europe are an abortion utopia compared with some American states, abortion access is still not guaranteed.
Let‚Äôs start with the UK. Due to the herculean efforts of activists (and despite the best efforts of a foot-dragging, anti-abortion government), Northern Ireland now has limited access to legal abortion. But Alliance for Choice, the campaign group in Northern Ireland, says that proper access to abortion is still not guaranteed across the country. Women are still waiting for the department of health to commission abortion services, telemedicine and more types of available abortion. Currently, the majority of abortions happen in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and are performed with pills, which carry a small risk of failure. Because there is virtually no provision for abortions after the first trimester, people seeking these services are still forced to travel to England.

I have just turned 17 and will soon go to college. I have always done well at school; I don‚Äôt drink, use drugs or even have a boyfriend, and would like to think I‚Äôm responsible. But choosing a career path has been rough.
I wanted to be a teacher, but my dad incessantly told me not to pursue that path because the salary isn‚Äôt great. I ended up agreeing and not going down that route. He wants me to study law; I said I would try to get into a good place to do it, as that is what he seems to want.

                    <span>Allianz Premier 15s kicks off, Harlequins defending title
Players with suspected concussion to be examined

England‚Äôs leading club women‚Äôs competition, the Allianz Premier 15s, kicks off at midday on Saturday with a west country encounter between Bristol Bears and Exeter Chiefs. There is a high level of expectation with many of the players hoping in 12 months‚Äô time to be flying off to New Zealand for the World Cup and fans back in grounds closed to them during the pandemic.
There have been some intriguing transfers in the summer, too, but arguably the most significant move in the competition this weekend will be off the pitch. In line with the men‚Äôs game, HIAs, head injury assessments with any players suspected of suffering concussion leaving the field to be examined by a doctor, will be used for the first time in the Allianz 15s. With this week‚Äôs publication by the University of South Wales into damage to the brain caused by collisions in professional rugby, the decision to monitor women is a welcome one.

According to the movies, a dead body can be used as a pretty much bulletproof human shield. You know the kind of scene. Under heavy attack, a character grabs the nearest corpse to hand and holds it in front of him, successfully using it as a kind of improvised meat armour to absorb gunfire, instead of taking it himself. Is this possible in real life? The popular science show Mythbusters ran a segment on it a few years ago and found that, while you could probably pick up a dead body in a gunfight, the idea that it would stop the bullets from hitting you was completely implausible.
Anyhow, with a hail of criticism bombarding the government from all sides, including its own, courageous big man Boris Johnson will reportedly hold an in-person cabinet meeting next week. Which is nice. It‚Äôs been a little irksome for the nation being lectured on the necessity of returning to the office by a government that phoned in its response to the fall of Kabul from a paddleboard.

Pair will face off for bronze medal in singles on Saturday

Of all the many emotional moments that have made these Paralympic Games such an involving, stirring spectacle, it is hard to think of one where the athletes were so visibly distraught. Red-eyed, shoulders slumped, their stares cast to the ground, Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett were inconsolable on Friday evening in Tokyo after experiencing defeat for the second time in as many days and as many Games.
On Thursday the British wheelchair tennis stars, currently ranked in the top five in the world as individuals and the best as a pair, were both beaten in the semi-finals of the singles competition. A day later and they were beaten in the gold medal match of the doubles, by the same French pairing that had vanquished them five years ago in Rio.

The government has urged all local authorities to come forward to offer homes to the thousands of families recently evacuated from Afghanistan, but only about a third of councils have volunteered so far.

I am typing these words in Portugal. I cannot quite believe it myself. When it comes to foreign holidays at the moment, there are two groups of people, certainly among my friendship group, which I am not for one second suggesting is a robust sample. One group thinks that the idea of going abroad is an impossible dream, and that the people who do so are rolling the dice on the future of their families. They are also secretly hoping the rules change and everyone has a nightmare getting back ‚Äì a sentiment I completely understand. The other group thinks that going abroad is our God-given right, that we have to do it for our own sanity, and that the 18 months in which British people have been unable to go on foreign holidays has been one of the greatest hardships of modern civilisation. 
The holiday itself has been wonderful. We booked a couple of weeks, because you have to write off the first week to just looking at one another and saying, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt quite believe we‚Äôre in another country!‚Äù There have been some issues. We went to a water park the other day. Whenever I go to a water park, I have to focus on my kids‚Äô enjoyment, rather than what thousands of children are emitting into the water, as well as dealing with feeling hideously self-aware when wandering around in shorts. We can argue about whether this is low self-esteem or narcissism, but the point is, I spend most of my time at water parks trying to protect my children from developing the same sort of hang-ups I have. This was made trickier by the fact that one of our kids said his favourite thing about the water rollercoaster was how my body was jiggling on the way up.

Last week, a group of employees launched #AppleToo, a campaign to gather and share current and past employees‚Äô experiences of inequity, intimidation and abuse. The group hopes to mobilize workers at a time when workers across the tech industry are calling for greater accountability from their employers, and to push Apple to more effectively address such complaints.

Its sleek pale wood and white lighting were chosen by the French justice ministry to create ‚Äúa sense of calm‚Äù in contrast to the horrific events which will soon be examined there. This temporary structure will from next week host the biggest criminal trial ever held in France, when 20 men are accused of planning, aiding and carrying out the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks on a stadium, bars and restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall.

It was nice to have that time together as the Games heads towards the final stages, to get some nuggets of wisdom from her and see how much she‚Äôs absorbed of what has happened in the past two weeks.
When we were in the taxi, and everything was all done, Sarah was relaxed. She was giving me the latest on her family, her son, Charlie, and her husband, Barney, and her eyes lit up as she talked. Sarah is the warmest, kindest nicest person you‚Äôll ever meet. But when we flew in to Tokyo on the same flight, the mood was different. I had a chat with her then too, but her guard was up.

                    <span>This extremist vigilante abortion law is of a piece with everything else Republicans are doing: overturning democracy itself 
The American right has been drunk on its freedom from two kinds of inhibition since Donald Trump appeared to guide them into the promised land of their unleashed ids. One is the inhibition from lies, the other from violence. Both are ways members of civil society normally limit their own actions out of respect for the rights of others and the collective good. Those already strained limits have snapped for leading Republican figures, from Tucker Carlson on Fox News to Ted Cruz in the Senate and for their followers.
We‚Äôve watched those followers gulp down delusions from Pizzagate to Qanon to Covid denialism to Trump‚Äôs election lies. And rough up journalists, crash vehicles into and wave weapons at Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist protesters at least since Charlottesville, menace statehouses, issue threats to doctors and school boards testifying about public health, and plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, for imposing Covid-prevention protocols.

Taxpayers should pay more to fund social care, according to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who suggested this should be through a tax increase rather than a national insurance rise that ‚Äúdisproportionately targets‚Äù the young.
The government is close to announcing a plan to increase national insurance rates by at least one percentage point, to fund its solution for the long-term funding of the crumbling social care system, with a final decision expected to be made within days.

Sixty doctors, nurses and other health professionals have staged a die-in protest outside JP Morgan‚Äôs Canary Wharf headquarters in London to highlight the bank‚Äôs investment in fossil fuels.
The protest on Friday was organised by one of Extinction Rebellion‚Äôs groups, Doctors for Extinction Rebellion. The climate activist medics said this was their biggest protest so far and that JP Morgan was the biggest funder of coal, oil and gas extraction.

                    <span>I could have sold my 1.3kg truffle for a fortune. But I had something more special in mind

It was 2am when I left the house that night in November 1999. I was heading out into the Motovun forest in Istria, in the north-west of Croatia, to hunt for truffles. Serious truffle hunting is done at night ‚Äì it‚Äôs better for the dogs, as the moisture carries the smell of the truffle better, and also it‚Äôs harder to be followed.
It was a freezing night ‚Äì the temperatures at that time of year dip below zero. Being a truffle hunter is not an easy job: it‚Äôs usually wet and muddy in the forest. You often get scratched and dirty, and can return empty-handed. Still, I had a gut feeling that the night would be a good one, so with Diana, my trusty German pointer, I set off.

These plans, codenamed Operation London Bridge, which were first revealed in a Guardian Long Read in 2017 and have now been seen in full by Politico, detail the scale of the arrangements for the funeral and government anxieties about whether the UK has the resources to execute them.

Having watched a woman and her baby die needlessly after being refused admission to a hospital over a lack of money, Liyatu Ayuba wanted to never let it happen again.
The 62-year-old is one of Nigeria‚Äôs nearly 3 million internally displaced people (IDPs) ‚Äì driven out of their homes by the violence of the Boko Haram Islamist militants. Ayuba fled Gwoza in the north-eastern state of Borno in 2011 with her family. After her husband was killed by Boko Haram and her teenage son badly wounded, she went to the makeshift Durumi 1 IDP camp, in Nigeria‚Äôs capital, Abuja, where about 500 families live.

                    <span>In primary school, I had a friend who I wanted to keep all to myself. Then fate intervened, in an unexpected and unfortunate way, to make it happen
When I was eight, I lived in fear of never making a friend. Then I made one, and lived in fear of her finding any other friends. Rosie was in the year below, puckish, quite surreal and completely carefree, which made her magnetic. You couldn‚Äôt do so much as a tour of the playground without someone thinking she would be a great addition to a skipping cartel, British bulldogs or a plot. She also had great hand-eye coordination, so, even without her character, her qualities would have been in high demand. This meant I had a medium-level phobia of playgrounds, which I managed as best I could by hiding it and praying for rain.
So this day, not the memorable day, was shaping up as badly as it possibly could. She was asked to join in with a game of rounders. I was spectating, shooting murderous looks at anyone who cheered her or in any other way sought her attention. A teacher joined in, Mr Gubbins. I probably shouldn‚Äôt name him in case I‚Äôve misremembered, but it was 40 years ago and he has a funny name. Let‚Äôs say it was him or it wasn‚Äôt.

                    <span>With new petrol and diesel vehicles to be banned in the UK from 2030, what can a road trip the length of the UK teach us about the future of cars?
Of 30m cars on the road in Britain, only 250,000 are electric ‚Äì but the number is going up fast. In July, new figures showed sales had risen 50% in a month; they are expected to outsell petrol and diesel models by 2025. And new petrol and diesel vehicles are due to be banned completely by 2030.
That‚Äôs unambiguously good news for the environment ‚Äì and yet many drivers are sceptical of going electric, worrying about underpowered engines and an inadequate charging network. Are those fears justified? What‚Äôs the chat like at the service station plug-in points? And why did that gull have to relieve itself on a loaned Skoda Enyaq just before the photographer showed up? Sam Wollaston sought the answers to all these questions on a road trip from Land‚Äôs End to John o‚ÄôGroats, and joined Rachel Humphreys to reflect on what he learned along the way.

                    <span>Online message board company preparing for initial public offering in early 2022, insiders say
Reddit is seeking to hire investment bankers and lawyers for an initial public offering in New York, two people familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency.
Reddit was valued at $10bn in a private fundraising round last month. By the time the IPO would take place early next year, the online message board company is hoping it will be valued at more than $15bn, one of the sources said.

Sweden recovered from a goal down to hand Spain their first World Cup qualifying defeat for 28 years with a shock 2-1 victory on Thursday.
Alexander Isak and Viktor Claesson produced sumptuous finishes to cancel out Carlos Soler‚Äôs early goal for the Euro 2020 semi-finalists and move Sweden top of Group B.

District attorney says Sharon Hill officers were returning fire

Investigators said on Thursday it was likely police fired the shots that killed an eight-year-old girl outside a high school football game near Philadelphia last week.
The Delaware county district attorney, Jack Stollsteimer, issued preliminary findings in the investigation, in what he said was an attempt to be transparent.

                    <span>It was an evening when, yet again, England had more than mere footballing problems thrown at them. It started with a hail of plastic cups, first for Raheem Sterling and then Luke Shaw, from the diehard Hungary supporters behind one of the goals, and it escalated to a firework ‚Äì which was hurled in the wake of Harry Maguire‚Äôs header for 3-0.
England‚Äôs players were celebrating as a group and it was a mighty relief that it missed its target, fizzing for a while before burning out. And then in the closing stages came the low point that everybody had dreaded.

                    <span>Oscar Isaac is a blank-eyed poker player with a past in Schrader‚Äôs latest gathering of lost, tormented souls
Paul Schrader makes films about lost souls in torment and unachievable goals, the sort of bleak existential purgatories that speak to our own uglier moments. Ahead of the Venice press screening of his latest production, an impromptu security cordon makes more than 100 guests late, after which they are only allowed into the cinema in small dribs and drabs - a tense, shuffling progress that extends throughout the film‚Äôs opening half-hour. The critics are in uproar; the ushers get lairy. Wherever he is, I imagine that Schrader himself would approve of the show.
On screen, The Card Counter provides another stylish, slow-burning account of Schrader‚Äôs lonesome samurai, a figure who can crop up in all walks of life: as a taxi driver, an escort, a drug dealer, a priest. On this occasion he‚Äôs embodied by a blank-eyed Oscar Isaac, who wears his scuffed leather jacket like a bulletproof vest. William Tell (formerly Tillich) is a veteran of Abu Ghraib and served eight years for his crimes. He now earns a living at the card tables and roulette wheels of middle America. The film has him driving the strip malls at night or prowling the stygian bowels of interchangeable casinos, with their patterned carpets and heavy black drapes. These joints have lights blazing everywhere and yet always appear cloaked in shadow. The gamblers, one worries, bring the darkness in with them.

Manchester United have confirmed returning signing Cristiano Ronaldo will wear the No 7 shirt. The Portuguese forward wore the iconic digit during his first spell at Old Trafford, becoming tied to the figure.
Striker Edinson Cavani has offered to vacate the shirt number, and will now wear 21 on the back of his shirt, the same as he uses for Uruguay. Cavani was in the No 7 when he came off the bench in the 1-0 win over Wolves at the weekend. Premier League rules stipulate any mid-season change of number requires the club to provide replacements to any fans who have paid to have the name and number of the previous occupant on their back.

Abba Voyage is probably just going to be a cruise, I thought. Only in my dreams did I think it would be a new song. Then at 6pm came the news: a whole new album, with two tracks released at once to herald its arrival.
Heralding this pop miracle are I Still Have Faith In You (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) and Don‚Äôt Shut Me Down (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ), two songs precision-honed to wallop emotion out of the listener (if you‚Äôre willing, that is: if you‚Äôve always been immune to Abba‚Äôs charms, these songs won‚Äôt melt your cold heart). I‚Äôve been an Abba fan since I was a little girl, and the opening strings on the former, full of minor-key melancholy, had me welling up immediately, pointing as they do to a classic Abba trope. Here‚Äôs a melody that feels like it‚Äôs already in its middle ‚Äì leaving the listener lost, rooting around for something to console them ‚Äì before it moves, with exquisite deliberation, towards the first verse (Dancing Queen also does this brilliantly).

Raducanu yet to drop a set at this year‚Äôs tournament

On the morning after the remnants of Hurricane Ida had swept across the New York area, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its path, at Flushing Meadows in Queens, efforts were focused on cleaning up ahead of play. The combination of torrential rain and thunderous wind had battered spectators, toppled refreshment stands and even led to it raining indoors under the Louis Armstrong Stadium roof. Play was suspended across all but the Arthur Ashe Stadium.
As the tennis restarted the one sight that remained entirely unchanged was the joy and confidence that Emma Raducanu carried with every ball she struck as she continued her rise. In her fifth match at her debut US Open, and against by far her most accomplished opponent, the 18-year-old treaded even deeper into the unknown by thoroughly outplaying Zhang Shuai of China 6-2, 6-4 to reach the third round without dropping a set.

The grumble here in 2018 about Melrose‚Äôs controversial ¬£8bn hostile takeover of GKN didn‚Äôt relate to the buyer‚Äôs supposed status of private equity-style vulture. That easy caricature has never quite fitted Melrose, a company that, yes, aims to sell everything it buys within five years, but also tends to invest heavily as well as cut costs.
Rather, the point about the takeover was that a majority of GKN shareholders rolled over too cheaply and delivered a bargain to Melrose. That analysis was threatened when the pandemic clobbered both of GKN‚Äôs core markets ‚Äì automotive and, especially, aerospace. But, now the economic weather is improving, the original turnaround script looks intact. It‚Äôs just been delayed a bit.

The cruel, vindictive and dangerous law that has taken effect in Texas is much more than the most extreme anti-abortion legislation in the United States. To many, it understandably feels like the beginning of the end ‚Äì denying women the rights enjoyed under the landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which established that abortion is legal before the foetus is viable outside the womb, at around 24 weeks. It will further embolden the religious right. Though polling suggests the majority of Americans believe that terminations should be legal in most or all cases, this is already the worst ever legislative year for restrictions.
But it is better understood as the end of the beginning. The right to abortion has, in practice, been systematically dismantled through methods ranging from intimidation to cynical regulation. This moment is the culmination of the first stage in a decades-long war on the rights of women, made possible by Donald Trump‚Äôs appointment of judges known to support restricting reproductive rights. A divided supreme court refused to block the legislation while the legal battle over it plays out.

                    <span>Labour should have a policy to deal with rich people seceding from the rest of society by buying social privilege
Gordon Brown gave substance to the slogan of ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù. In 2006, he said that his ‚Äúlong-term aim‚Äù was to fund state school pupils at the same level as those in private schools. Back then, fee-paying schools had 60% more resources per pupil. Mr Brown made some headway: by 2010, he had raised state school funding by 20% to a high point of ¬£7,200 per pupil. Since then, the Conservative party has been in charge. In the last decade, independent school income has raced away while state school spending per pupil in England, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has seen the largest cut ‚Äì 9% in real terms ‚Äì in over 40 years.
The thinktank has sifted the wheat from the government‚Äôs rhetorical chaff. Even with Boris Johnson‚Äôs promised extra ¬£7bn in state school spending, per-pupil expenditure in 2023 will still be ‚Äú1 to 2% lower in real terms‚Äù than in 2010. Mr Johnson‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúfair funding‚Äù turns out to be bigger real-term funding increases for wealthier schools than for ones with more deprived intakes. A pay rise for teachers may arrive, but potential recruits face larger class sizes and equipment shortages.

Dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists have carried out a mass act of non-violent civil disobedience by breaking bail conditions ordering them to stay away from the City of London financial district.
The activists joined with hundreds of supporters in a low-key rally outside the Bank of England on Thursday afternoon, listening to speeches from a mobile sound system.

A Charity Commission inquiry found the Alternative Animal Sanctuary in Boston, Lincolnshire, was chaotically run, spending just ¬£900,000 on the care of animals from an ¬£8m fund raised by the public over seven years.

I had thought I had come to terms with suffering in the world. I have a good life, good husband, enjoy my job, good health, lovely place to live, no money worries. On an intellectual level I know being sad won‚Äôt help anyone. I do some volunteer work, vote for who I believe is a better choice, donate some money to charities I believe in, live a simple life, I thought that was enough.
But, recent world events have broken through. How can I experience joy when there is so much suffering? I could turn off the news, withdraw even further, but is that not selfish cowardice? Should I not at least bear witness? I feel like outside is endless suffering, which I can not stop. I feel guilty, then I feel self indulgent about feeling guilty. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or feel any more.

With arms outstretched and legs kicking, a grandfather and grandson glide over office towers and city blocks, their flight powered by imagination, a rudimentary green screen and a VHS camera. The scene is part of a cache of footage shot by Brisbane musician Sam Poggioli‚Äôs grandfather, Merv, who passed away in 2003 when Poggioli was a teenager.
The green screen flying experiment now appears in the video for his single Memories in Flight, released under Poggioli‚Äôs Sampology moniker. Finishing recutting the family footage for the single‚Äôs video, he says, ‚Äúwas a joyous feeling that also made me want to cry‚Äù. He was only eight years old, but precisely remembers looking back at his grandfather behind the camera, while they filmed in Merv‚Äôs shed.

                    <span>Going back to Naples and the tragedy that changed his life, The Great Beauty director evokes his adolescence with bawdy vigour
At 16, Paolo Sorrentino returned home to find that both his parents were dead, killed by a carbon monoxide leak. On the night of the tragedy, Sorrentino was inside a football stadium, watching Diego Maradona play for his local team, Napoli. Afterwards, he would say ‚Äì not wholly joking ‚Äì that Maradona saved his life.
More than three decades on, in the middle act of a career that has already won him an Oscar, the Italian film-maker has retraced his steps, turned back the clock and fashioned this foundational horror into a fevered coming-of-age tale, a movie that played to a capacity crowd here in Venice. The Hand of God, no surprise, is Sorrentino‚Äôs most nakedly personal film to date, almost to a fault in the way it jettisons the cool distance of The Great Beauty or Il Divo in favour of a sweaty, close-up evocation of youth. It‚Äôs a picture only Sorrentino could make. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make him the safest pair of hands.

                    <span>Classical composer famed for his film scores to Zorba the Greek and Serpico, and for his firebrand politics
For those with only a nodding acquaintance with Greece and Greek music, the name of Mikis Theodorakis, who has died aged 96, still conjures up Zorba the Greek and that moment on a Cretan beach when Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates break into an ecstatic dance. It was often hard for the classically trained composer to live down his image as a writer of memorable film scores. Despite the performance of his operas, symphonies and songs in some of the major concert halls of Europe, Theodorakis remained, for many, the man who wrote the catchy bouzouki music of Zorba and the Costa-Gavras film Z.
For those who remember the 1967-74 military dictatorship in Greece, he was also a symbol of resistance to that regime. But Theodorakis was much more than a political symbol and a writer of film scores. He was a composer of great melodic gifts: he composed more songs than Schubert and the best of them ‚Äì his settings of Lorca, Seferis, Brendan Behan, Kambanellis, Elytis and Ritsos ‚Äì do not suffer by the comparison. It may be that his other works will one day occupy a place in the repertoire of 20th-century classical composition, but his songs will undoubtedly remain the most enduring legacy of the man known to his friends simply as o psilos ‚Äì the tall one.

                    <span>Attempts to legitimise warfare should be met with scepticism, argues Andrew Clapham. Plus letters from Prof Keith Hayward, Blaine Stothard and Margaret Vandecasteele
Samuel Moyn is right to emphasise how humanising war has distracted attention from questioning whether there should be a war in the first place (How the US created a world of endless war, 31 August). We could go further and argue that the permissive interpretation of the rules that he highlights has actually led to a dehumanisation in war.
The last 20 years have seen torture, multiple targeted killings by drones controlled from a safe distance, apparently self-explanatory categories such as ‚Äúlaw-of-war detainees‚Äù, ‚Äúlaw-of-war targets‚Äù, and the destruction of objects contributing to what has been called the ‚Äúwar-sustaining economy‚Äù. It is as if once one accepts one is at war, we accept that sticking a ‚Äúlaw-of-war‚Äù label on all the killing and destruction makes it inevitable and acceptable.

                    <span>John Rippon says the public and policymakers should be aware of the potential harm caused by potassium chloride and Mike Pender says there is no need to add more salt, or substitutes, to food
Re your report in the print edition (Salt substitute cuts risk of heart attack ‚Äì study, 31 August), it was with great alarm that I read the statement attributed to Prof Bruce Neal that ‚Äúif you were to replace all of the salt on supermarket shelves with salt substitutes, you would prevent thousands of strokes and heart attacks every year‚Äù. According to a report by NHS Kidney Care, ‚Äúmore than 1.8 million people in England have diagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, there are thought to be around a million people who have the condition but are undiagnosed. CKD can substantially reduce quality of life, and leads to premature death for thousands of people each year.‚Äù
Most diagnosed kidney patients must strictly limit their intake of potassium as an excess of this element in the body can lead to stroke and sudden heart failure. As the report states, the most ubiquitous substitute for sodium chloride (common salt) is potassium chloride. Therefore, far from preventing strokes and heart attacks, such a widespread substitution could cause many thousands of extra such occurrences among patients with significantly reduced kidney function. As a kidney dialysis patient, I believe that this fact should be made widely known among the public, but particularly among potential policymakers.

Originally published by the 19th.
With the vast majority of abortions now illegal in Texas, clinics in nearby states are already reporting increases in demand as patients prepare to travel hundreds of miles to safely, legally terminate a pregnancy.

There is ‚Äúalmost certainly no urgency‚Äù to press ahead with booster shots for healthy adults and it may be better to see how the pandemic pans out before a decision is made, the scientist leading key research into third shots has said.
Prof Saul Faust, chief investigator of the Cov-Boost study whose data next week is expected to help inform a decision on the rollout of boosters across the UK, told the Guardian that for now it may be preferable to prioritise only the vulnerable, including those with compromised immune systems.

                    <span>Jobs, wages, housing: young people are paying a price. We have to address this or risk their anger boiling over
The pandemic‚Äôs next effect might be a wave of political conflict. A rising tide of anger among young people at what they have willingly sacrificed for older people emerges in a major survey across 12 European countries. It has split the continent along old faultlines ‚Äì rich versus poor zones, north and west versus south and east ‚Äì dividing people between those strongly affected and those barely touched. But most starkly the rift falls between generations: two-thirds of over-60s have done relatively well, while two-thirds of under-30s feel their opportunities have been cruelly truncated. Their trust in governments has fallen perilously.
One ‚Äúwarning‚Äù is a repeat of the 1968 youthquake: some of us who were there might think that‚Äôs long overdue. Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, which produced the survey, says young people ‚Äúfeel like those who fought in wars. They complied, they obeyed to save parents and grandparents, yet they are the long-term victims.‚Äù Damage to their jobs, education and life chances will possibly scar that generation permanently.

Heard together, the differences between Penderecki‚Äôs First and Fourth quartets map an epic journey in 20th-century music
Krzysztof Penderecki‚Äôs four numbered string quartets do not trace the course of his creative development anything like as faithfully as, say, the six quartets of Bart√≥k or the five of Elliott Carter map the progress of those composers. A 40-year gap separated the composition of the Second Quartet in 1968 from the Third, an interval broken only by the tiny quartet movement Der unterbrochen Gedanke, written in 1988 as a memorial to Penderecki‚Äôs publisher.

Children involved in religious organisations, including Sunday schools and madrasas, are vulnerable to sexual abuse in cultures where victim blaming, abuse of power and mistrust of external authorities are common, a report says.
The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said there was ‚Äúno doubt that the sexual abuse of children takes place in a broad range of religious settings‚Äù. It found evidence of ‚Äúegregious failings‚Äù and highlighted the hypocrisy of religions that purport to teach right from wrong, yet fail to protect children.

Jules White is headteacher at Tanbridge House School, Horsham

Like most headteachers I view the formal start back to school with a mixture of optimism and trepidation.
There is a realistic hope that, following a mass vaccination programme for adults, school life can begin to look and feel like it is approaching normality again. Assemblies, staff meetings, extra-curricular activities and the simple yet inspiring buzz of learning and social interaction can resume in earnest. After a bleak, disruptive 18 months these everyday pleasures must be celebrated.

The court‚Äôs order is stunning. Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.
Last night, the court silently acquiesced in a state‚Äôs enactment of a law that flouts nearly 50 years of federal precedents. Today, the court belatedly explains that it declined to grant relief because of procedural complexities of the state‚Äôs own invention. Because the court‚Äôs failure to act rewards tactics designed to avoid judicial review and inflicts significant harm on the applicants and on women seeking abortions in Texas, I dissent.

A book was a useful excuse to speak to other British directors about their experiences. And, during the first lockdown, many of them had enough time on their hands to oblige. So, by Skype and Zoom, I spoke with 15 people: Pawe≈Ç Pawlikowski, Danny Boyle, Joanna Hogg, Asif Kapadia, James Marsh, Andrew Haigh, Carol Morley, Edgar Wright, Steve McQueen, Lynne Ramsay, Stephen Daldry, Ben Wheatley, Peter Strickland, Mike Leigh and Ken Loach.

                    <span>Young, angry men are falling down a rabbit hole of online radicalisation. The isolation of Covid will only make this worse
Read a book, as the old saying goes, and it will set you free. But even the power of literature surely has its limits, and this week a judge in Leicester tested them. Faced with a Nazi sympathiser convicted of downloading bomb-making instructions, and white supremacist and fascist material from the internet, Judge Spencer issued a suspended two-year sentence and instructions to read Jane Austen or Charles Dickens instead. ‚ÄúThink about Hardy. Think about Trollope,‚Äù he added, helpfully. Shakespeare‚Äôs Twelfth Night, the judge thought, might be a good place to start.
It might have made more sense had he recommended Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland. For Ben John, the 21-year-old former student convicted of downloading more than 67,000 extreme documents, seems to have fallen down a depressingly familiar dark rabbit hole. The judge described him as a lonely individual with few, if any, proper friends. He fits a well-worn pattern of socially awkward, angry young men retreating from the outside world into dark online subcultures, where each click leads to something more extreme. For John, it was white supremacism and fascism. For others it could be Islamist fundamentalism, or a violently misogynistic incel culture, where men who can‚Äôt get women to have sex with them vent their frustrated rage against women everywhere.

There were those few weeks of strange, haunted gigs in autumn 2020, but for most people live music disappeared at the start of March last year and didn‚Äôt return until this summer. It was a peculiar enough experience being in the crowds, but what was it like for the artists walking on stage after 18 months without the hum of amps, the dimming of house lights and the roar of an audience? From festival headline sets to low-key club shows, this is how the return to playing live felt for the musicians who came back.

                    <span>Family praises brothers who stopped seven-year-old from drowning, after using Facebook to track them down
A woman has spoken of her gratitude after she managed to track down the two men who saved her son from drowning.
When seven-year-old Frankie Creek fell off a jetty at Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes one evening last month, his mother, Natasha, was too distracted by their barking dogs to hear the splash.

                    <span>A 17th triumph makes her the most decorated Paralympic athlete in British history and she may be still a contender in 2024
Attempting to put a marathon athletic career into context can seem reductive. It is 29 years since Dame Sarah Storey won the first Paralympic gold medal of the series which reached a climactic point on Thursday morning, when her victory in Tokyo‚Äôs rain-soaked C4-5 road race pushed her gold medal tally to 17, making her the most crowned Paralympic athlete in British sporting history. That‚Äôs five more golds than the golden couple of British Olympic cycling, Jason and Laura Kenny.
When Storey tackled her first Paralympics aged 14, as a swimmer in Barcelona, cycling was a Cinderella sport. Chris Boardman‚Äôs gold medal in that Games was a glorious aberration, and the ‚Äúmedal factory‚Äù in Manchester ‚Äì which now seems as if it has been there for ever ‚Äì was not even a gleam in the eye of its founder, Boardman‚Äôs then-coach Peter Keen; it began life five years later. Storey‚Äôs Paralympic debut is that long ago that when she first pulled on GB kit, Lance Armstrong was not even a professional cyclist, Miguel Indurain was in his prime, Kelloggs and the Milk Marketing Board still sponsored cycling Tours of Britain, and in the political world, Tony Blair as prime minister was a remote prospect.

The Dublin-based Data Protection Commission (DPC) announced the decision on Thursday after a three-year investigation into the messaging app, which is owned by Facebook. It ordered WhatsApp to remedy its policies to protect personal data.

                    <span>The expansion of drylands is leaving entire countries facing famine. It‚Äôs time to change the way we think about agriculture

David R Montgomery is professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington, and author of Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations and Growing a Revolution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life

This summer‚Äôs record-setting heatwaves and dramatic fires in southern Europe and the American west were stark reminders that the climate crisis has arrived. But as the world warms, there is also a quieter, lesser-known crisis unfolding underfoot. Desertification, long seen primarily as a threat to developing nations, is coming for Europe and North America too, as worsening droughts bake soils already degraded by conventional farming and grazing practices.
In Spain, for example, about a fifth of all land is now at high risk of desertification, as is much of the agricultural land across Italy, Greece, and western North America.

Lester Holloway, who was announced on Thursday as editor of the Voice, said the original statement by the Society of Editors that the UK media was not racist or bigoted, and which strongly disputed claims the Duke and Duchess of Sussex‚Äôs negative coverage was motivated by racism, was part of a wider ‚Äúregression‚Äù in recognising and tackling racial inequality.

Inspirational to the last, Ellie Simmonds concluded her Paralympic career in Tokyo on Thursday without a ninth medal to add to her haul from Beijing, London and Rio, but confident too that teammates who were motivated by her own achievements ‚Äúare now inspiring the next generation‚Äù.
Simmonds was initially disqualified from fifth place in the women‚Äôs 400m freestyle S6 for not touching the wall on her second turn, but reinstated following an appeal. It was the last of her three finals in Tokyo, following a fourth place behind teammate Maisie Summers-Newton in the 100m breaststroke and fifth in the 200m individual medley.

                    <span>Sitting the exam had been completely routine, but I soon realised grammar school would be a major turning point
My most memorable day was the morning I came to primary school knowing I had passed my 11-plus and would be going to grammar school: Harrow County Grammar School for Girls. I knew the 11-plus was important, but had no idea how pivotal it was to be. Taking the exam was completely routine. Nobody I knew had special tuition for it ‚Äì or if they did, I didn‚Äôt know about it. 
Although my parents were devout Labour voters, the debate about grammar schools had passed them by. They had no idea that good socialists were not supposed to send their children to grammar school, let alone sit the 11-plus. Like generations of immigrants before them, and generations still to come, they believed passionately in education. Education was the means by which we, the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation, would fulfil our parents‚Äô dreams and aspirations. So, if going to grammar school meant you got a good education, my parents believed that it must be a good thing.

                    <span>As the rubber bullets and teargas flew during last year‚Äôs protests, an epidemic of ‚Äòless lethal‚Äô shootings inspired a network of survivors
My mind raced in the seconds after I was shot.
I heard the gun go off and turned my head toward the sound, just in time to watch the spinning aluminum canister slam into my brow. Everything went black. I stumbled. When I regained my balance and opened my eyes, the sight in my right eye was gone. Something in my head told me the teargas canister was the last thing I‚Äôd ever see clearly.

                    <span>When we find it difficult to say ‚Äòno‚Äô at work or at home, our responsibilities can quickly become overwhelming. For good mental health, focusing on our own needs and capabilities is crucial
No. A tiny, yet mighty word. To hear it can make us feel childlike; sheepish or in trouble. How does it make you feel to say ‚Äúno‚Äù? Strong? Nervous? Guilty? Do you say it often enough?
In July, when the gymnast Simone Biles withdrew from most of her Olympics appearances, citing emotional exhaustion that was affecting her ability to perform, her ‚Äúno‚Äù was a thunderbolt. Reactions were largely supportive, but opinions were divided along political lines in the US. White, male sports pundits (and, predictable as the arrow of time, Piers Morgan) used the word ‚Äúselfish‚Äù. It was a similar story when the tennis player Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open in May, speaking of ‚Äúlong bouts of depression‚Äù and ‚Äúhuge waves of anxiety‚Äù before her pre- and post-match press conferences.

In November, gigantic yellow excavators began scooping up the poisonous sludge colloquially known as ‚Äúblack mayonnaise‚Äù from the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York ‚Äì a momentous step in a prolonged cleanup effort, 10 years after the waterway‚Äôs designation as a Superfund site.
But the mood is bittersweet. Longtime residents who campaigned for the Superfund label say they are now facing another environmental battle: a proposed mega-development in the neighborhood that would sit on top of a century‚Äôs worth of toxic chemicals.

More than a decade ago, Adam Bowen and James Monsees became friends over their smoke breaks at Stanford University. They were graduate students when they first conceived of the idea behind Juul: conventional cigarettes, like the ones they couldn‚Äôt stop smoking, were bad not because of nicotine, but for all the other chemicals from burnt tar.
The pair had a vision: design a device that would deliver solely nicotine, offer a better experience for smokers and help those who wanted to quit cigarettes.

                    <span>The year 2020 exposed the risks and weaknesses of the market-driven global system like never before. It‚Äôs hard to avoid the sense that a turning point has been reached
If one word could sum up the experience of 2020, it would be disbelief. Between Xi Jinping‚Äôs public acknowledgment of the coronavirus outbreak on 20 January 2020, and Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration as the 46th president of the United States precisely a year later, the world was shaken by a disease that in the space of 12 months killed more than 2.2 million people and rendered tens of millions severely ill. Today the official death tolls stands at 4.51 million. The likely figure for excess deaths is more than twice that number. The virus disrupted the daily routine of virtually everyone on the planet, stopped much of public life, closed schools, separated families, interrupted travel and upended the world economy.
To contain the fallout, government support for households, businesses and markets took on dimensions not seen outside wartime. It was not just by far the sharpest economic recession experienced since the second world war, it was qualitatively unique. Never before had there been a collective decision, however haphazard and uneven, to shut large parts of the world‚Äôs economy down. It was, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) put it, ‚Äúa crisis like no other‚Äù.

Jules White and Nicola Davis have done their homework
For most people, it‚Äôs been hard enough managing the logistics of their own pandemic. For Jules White, it‚Äôs been on a whole other scale. He‚Äôs the headteacher of Tanbridge House school in Surrey, and as well as remembering his own mask, he‚Äôs been in charge of more than 1,500 pupils and 150 staff. As his school and others across England and Wales come back this week, he explains the challenges of managing a return to the classroom, and the struggles and rewards of helping pupils do their best in the most complicated of circumstances.
Nosheen Iqbal is also joined by the Guardian‚Äôs science correspondent, Nicola Davis, who sets out the latest evidence and advice on issues including the rates of transmission and serious illness among children, the pros and cons of vaccinating teenagers, and whether we should be concerned about a reported rise in coronavirus cases linked to schools going back in Scotland.

                    <span>Manager wants side to keep up strong form in Hungary
Jadon Sancho a doubt for Thursday‚Äôs World Cup qualifier

Gareth Southgate has called for focus and humility when England visit Hungary in World Cup qualifying on Thursday night, telling his team not to start ‚Äúswanning around‚Äù after their exploits at Euro 2020.
England‚Äôs manager has put to one side the pain of losing on penalties to Italy in the final of the Euros and is thinking about how to reach even greater heights. Southgate said that nothing other than winning next year‚Äôs World Cup in Qatar would do after the near-miss against Italy and he believes that will be possible only if his players steer clear of complacency.

                    <span>Cristiano Ronaldo just would not be denied. He had a penalty saved by Gavin Bazunu and then saw John Egan put the Republic of Ireland on course for what would have been a famous and deserved victory. But Manchester United‚Äôs newest signing struck twice in the dying minutes to give his country victory and prolong his own legend, a pair of majestic headers making him the most prolific scorer in the history of men‚Äôs international football.
Ronaldo took his goal tally from 180 matches for his country to 111, two more than Ali Daei scored for Iran ‚Äì and 102 more than the combined haul of Ireland‚Äôs starting XI on the Algarve. Ronaldo‚Äôs extraordinary feat made for an agonising end for the Ireland manager, Stephen Kenny, whose team delivered an intelligent and confident performance, proving they have made serious progress since losing at home to Luxembourg in March. Ireland have zero points from three qualifiers, and Kenny has one win from 14 matches in charge, but there was plenty of reason here to believe they are going in the right direction. There is no shame in being thwarted by the greatest scorer of all time.

England reclaimed Fortress Chelmsford with a vengeance, hitting their highest T20 score against New Zealand ‚Äì 184 for four ‚Äì before bowling out their opponents for 138 in 18.5 overs to finish with a huge 46-run win.
Two years ago, England were subject to an onslaught from the mighty Meg Lanning here. Tammy Beaumont‚Äôs 97 from 65 balls ‚Äì her fourth half-century of the international summer ‚Äì meant England doled out a taste of that same medicine.

Dan Evans has achieved a fair few notable wins at the US Open over the years and it is undoubtedly the grand slam tournament where he most reliably produces his best tennis, but after a summer disrupted by testing positive for Covid-19, his journey to the third round for the fourth time must surely be the most satisfying runs of his time spent in New York.
In an afternoon ravaged by rain and the looming threat of Hurricane Ida, Dan Evans navigated multiple disruptions to defeat home favourite Marcos Giron 6-4, 7-6 (3), 2-6, 6-3 and advance.

There is only one way out of the Golden Bear neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe, and as the flames of the Caldor fire crept closer on Monday that could easily have turned into a catastrophe.
But as the fire bore down on the neighborhood, a cluster of a couple of hundred homes tucked into the conifer-covered mountainside near the famous California lake, residents didn‚Äôt panic. They packed.

The online discussion site acted after 135 Reddit communities, or subreddits, announced they had ‚Äúgone dark‚Äù, a move that blocks non-members from reading or joining the page, in protest at the site‚Äôs refusal to limit discussions that propagate misleading theories about the pandemic.

                    <span>Foreign secretary, previously known for saying too much, now is vague and unreactive
A therapist once introduced me to a strategy which I‚Äôll paraphrase as ‚Äúboring on purpose‚Äù ‚Äì when someone‚Äôs speaking, and you find your mind wandering, the fault may not be yours. It could be that they‚Äôre being repetitive, vague, unreactive, wadding each sentence with generalities like cavity wall insulation, for a reason: to resist the intimacy of your full attention, to divert you from whatever it is they don‚Äôt want to discuss. If it‚Äôs a useful tactic in everyday life, that‚Äôs nothing on its deployment in front of a select committee.
Dominic Raab was previously known for his pugnacity, prone to saying more than he meant to, in irritation. That trait has been ironed out in whatever word-management course ministers are now obliged to attend, and the foreign affairs select committee, chaired by Tom Tugendhat, was treated to an altogether different man ‚Äì quietly monotonous, defeatist without being penitent, trotting out the same rote phrases like a copy-and-paste job from the clipboard remnants of his bleached out personality.

Comedians become actors, pop stars become TV presenters ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre used to artists switching lanes. Seldom travelled, though, is the road leading from performance poetry to TV producing ‚Äì TV producers not being renowned for their poetic souls. It may be that Henry Normal is the only poet to make that journey, and he did it with spectacular success, co-running the production company Baby Cow with Steve Coogan, creating hit after hit (Gavin and Stacey, The Mighty Boosh, Nighty Night) across a 17-year run. But the siren call of spoken word proved impossible to resist: Normal quit producing five years ago and is now prepping a standup poetry tour.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest tour I‚Äôve ever done,‚Äù he tells me, Zooming from his native Nottingham. ‚ÄúI toured with Caroline Aherne and Steve back in the day. I‚Äôve done over 1,000 gigs in my life. But an actual theatre tour, where it‚Äôs me doing a full show by myself? That‚Äôs very much a big deal for me.‚Äù The tour, called The Escape Plan, will feature work from his two lockdown-era collections, The Beauty Within Shadow and The Distance Between Clouds, as well as material from the BBC Radio 4 shows that began in 2016 with A Normal Family. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mixture of stories and comedy, jokes and poems,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically 64 years in the making, and I‚Äôm hoping to pack it all into just under two hours.‚Äù

Calum Maclean and Jenny Graham had grown tired of several daylong hikes across Alpine ridges, and were in search of genuine novelty. They were surprised to find it a little closer to home: a trek across the heather-covered hills of the Cairngorms, but in an entirely straight line.
On Monday night, the adventurers became the first people to walk the longest straight line in the UK without crossing a paved road, after spending four days crossing 78.55km (48.8 miles) from the Pass of Drumochter to Corgarff in north Scotland.

The UK Foreign Office‚Äôs own risk assessment warned that the Taliban could return rapidly to power, causing cities to collapse and triggering a humanitarian crisis, less than four weeks before the fall of Kabul.
Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, told MPs on Wednesday that he believed the Afghan capital would remain safe until next year based on an assessment by the joint intelligence committee, a view he said was widely shared by Nato allies.

Read The Ritual Seat of the King by Gift Nyoni below

Gift Nyoni has won the 2021 4thWrite prize for his short story The Ritual Seat of the King, a ‚Äúwise, subtle and intimate‚Äù look at how the life of a young boy changes as the Rhodesian civil war comes to an end.
The Zimbabwe-born Nyoni‚Äôs winning entry follows David, a boy whose father has been absent for years, and whose mother has been receiving ‚Äúvisitors‚Äù in his absence. After the war ends, and Rhodesia becomes Zimbabwe, his father returns home but his homecoming is not what David anticipated. Nyoni, a trainee solicitor at a London firm, beat five other shortlisted authors, including Sulaxana Hippisley and Laura Blake, to win the award, which is run jointly by the Guardian and publisher 4th Estate. It aims to find the best new writers from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds based in the UK.

                    <span>The 2.1% rise cited by Nationwide was likely to be due to cheap loans and a desire to get out of cities
More evidence that Rishi Sunak‚Äôs pandemic freebie for homebuyers was a waste of money: even when the stamp duty holiday was partly removed, house prices continued to fly. The 2.1% rise in August, on the Nationwide‚Äôs readings, was the second largest monthly increase in 15 years.
It all suggests the 13% rise in house prices since the start of the pandemic had little to do with Sunak‚Äôs subsidies. The Resolution Foundation thinktank reached that conclusion in a persuasive analysis last week, arguing that the big drivers were low interest rates ‚Äì a proven catalyst ‚Äì plus accumulated lockdown savings and the desire among some buyers to get out of cities in search of more space. That account rings true. The housing market did not need support and Sunak did not have to let an estimated ¬£4.4bn in tax receipts slip between the cracks.

Half a million people in the UK who have severely weakened immune systems are to be offered third shots of Covid vaccines in an effort to improve their protection against the disease.

Pupils in England could be put on a ‚Äúglide path‚Äù back to pre-pandemic exam grading over the next two years, as the government prepares to unveil plans to avoid a sudden drop in national A-level and GCSE results awarded from 2022 onwards.
Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, is said to be aiming for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù in the overall distribution of grades that pupils receive in returning to the system last used in 2019, before the grade acceleration seen in 2020 and 2021 when formal exams were replaced by teacher assessment.

When judging a government‚Äôs performance in a crisis, there is a distinction to be drawn between control and responsibility. No British minister could have stopped the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. But there was time for contingency planning between that unilateral US policy being declared in February 2020 and its completion last month. Dominic Raab could not control the Taliban‚Äôs advance on Kabul, but that does not excuse him from responsibility for a chaotic and incomplete evacuation.
In an appearance before a parliamentary select committee on Wednesday, the foreign secretary sought cover behind intelligence assessments predicting a slower decay of the situation in Afghanistan, with the capital not falling this year.

                    <span>He would have been 100 this week, yet so much of Raymond Williams‚Äôs writing speaks directly to our politics
He was born 100 years ago this week in the Welsh village of Pandy, just outside the market town of Abergavenny, and smack on the border with England. And borders were to become one of Raymond Williams‚Äôs key subjects. In all kinds of senses: borders of space and time and class and in personal relationships. Yet what made Williams one of 20th century Britain‚Äôs most important cultural critics was his refusal to take any of these boundaries as unchanging and fixed. The son of a railway signalman got a scholarship to Cambridge, was sent to fight in the invasion of Normandy in 1944, before ending his days in the 1980s writing novels about the Black Mountains as often as not from his home in Essex. He moved about politically, too, starting in the Communist party and ending in Plaid Cymru. Often ranked, rightly, among Wales‚Äôs greatest writers, he had a lot to say about place without ever being narrowly parochial or dogmatic.
His early masterpiece The Country and the City opens by observing that the ‚Äúcontrast between country and city, as fundamental ways of life, reaches back into classical times‚Äù ‚Äì before swiftly tearing down that divide by taking the reader through 400 years of English literature and showing how these two supposed archetypes changed meaning and association again and again. In the wake of the Brexit vote, politicians and scholars have paid attention to place like rarely before, jawing on about the ‚ÄúRed Wall‚Äù, ‚Äúleft-behind places‚Äù, ‚ÄúCambridge versus Clacton‚Äù and any number of other brittle stereotypes that are crying out for a Williams-style demolition.

Up to one in seven children who test positive for coronavirus could still have symptoms linked to the disease three months later, according to a study that suggests the prevalence of long Covid in young people is lower than initially feared.
The analysis, led by University College London and Public Health England researchers, drew on survey responses from nearly 7,000 11- to 17-year-olds who underwent PCR tests between January and March. Of these, 3,065 tested positive and 3,739 tested negative.

Half a million people with severely weakened immune systems are to be offered third Covid vaccine shots in a move that will increase debate over the rollout of booster jabs for the wider population.
The NHS will provide third doses for those aged 12 and up who have severely compromised or suppressed immune systems at a time decided by their clinicians. It follows a recommendation on Wednesday from the government‚Äôs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

                    <span>Palestinians are being repressed and brutalised by their own government in collaboration with the Israeli state

Yara Hawari is a senior policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy Network

On 24 June, Nizar Banat, a longtime activist and outspoken critic of the Palestinian Authority (PA), was reportedly arrested and beaten outside his cousin‚Äôs home in Hebron by the authority‚Äôs security forces ‚Äì he died in custody shortly after. In regular videos recorded and posted to his social media accounts, Banat often took the Palestinian Authority to task for its corruption, lack of democratic practice and collaboration with Israel. A few days prior to his death, he had uploaded a video in which he accused the authority of selling out the Palestinian struggle.

Glasgow, the host city of the crucial Cop26 UN climate summit in November, has experienced its hottest summer on record, the Met Office has said.
Scotland also recorded the highest UK temperature in August ‚Äì 27.2C (80.9F) recorded at Tyndrum ‚Äì breaking a run of 20 years during which England had the hottest day. The summer was unusually dry in Scotland as well, with just 62% of average rainfall.

The ‚Äúgreat replacement‚Äù ‚Äì the conspiracy theory that globalist elites are planning to supplant the white population of Europe with Muslim and/or black migrants ‚Äì was originally formulated by the French white nationalist writer Renaud Camus.
Not unusually, what French history turns into tragedy ‚Äì the theory inspired the Christchurch mass murderer, Brenton Tarrant ‚Äì British history prefigures as farce. As far back as the end of the 19th century, the Conservative MP Arthur Brookfield‚Äôs ‚Äúpolitical satire‚Äù Simiocracy described how a Liberal government, determined to entrench itself in power, extended the franchise to gorillas, millions of whom arrived from Borneo.

                    <span>My backlog of prestige shows grows bigger by the day - I have still only watched three series of Mad Men. But Don Draper‚Äôs existential crisis can‚Äôt compete with Married at First Sight UK
Rewatching The Sopranos was fun for a year, sure. But, as a successful-if-boring series of Love Island proved, normal TV is back again ‚Äì and with it the compulsive urge to watch it. This year has taught me that there is a near-limitless stock of prestige TV I haven‚Äôt got round to yet (I am only three series into Mad Men. Mad Men!), but the allure still clings to the rhythmic, the medicinal, the brain-off glossy stuff that wastes an hour of your life without making you think.
After weeks of watching Love Island, half against my will, E4 has this week had the temerity to put out a different daily reality bingefest, Married at First Sight UK. I already know I am going to watch every episode of that at 9pm instead of seeing what nice suit Don Draper is wearing during his semi-silent personal crisis. I simply cannot be bothered to watch good TV any more.

                    <span>Readers respond to Gaby Hinsliff‚Äôs article about Pen Farthing‚Äôs evacuation of animals from Afghanistan
The emotive language of Gaby Hinsliff‚Äôs article (What a story to tell the world: Britain values dogs more than Afghan people, 30 August) not only risks deflecting attention from the consequences of the reactive, rather than proactive, response of the British government, but also suggests that one cannot care equally about the victims of humanitarian crises and the plight of other innocent species in manmade conflicts.
Accordingly, ‚Äúhuman souls‚Äù are pitted against a ‚Äúmenagerie of strays‚Äù, whose lives a former soldier in Afghanistan and his Afghan staff valued enough to wish to save at the risk of their own survival. Ms Hinsliff is no doubt correct in noting that cats are ‚Äúof no conceivable interest to the Taliban‚Äù, so what fate does she imagine awaited these animals under the new rulers of the country?

                    <span>Giving low-paid workers a decent increase will make very little difference, writes Dr Robert Nicholls
I fully agree with Larry Elliott (So what‚Äôs so wrong with labour shortages driving up low wages?‚Äô, 29 August) and take issue with your correspondent (Letters, 30 August). As a former wages inspector, I well remember Margaret Thatcher and other rightwingers‚Äô arguments for the abolition of the wages councils that set minimum rates in traditionally low-paid and usually non-unionised industries. Their arguments were basically the same ‚Äì that it would increase inflation.
It is surprising to me that so many people who I suspect consider themselves to be leftwing are opposed to poorly paid workers improving their pay. Inflation does not have to be a consequence of increased pay. When the wages councils introduced yearly pay increases, there was no subsequent increase in inflation. This was because the rates were still quite low compared to the average pay rates throughout the country as a whole. The decision to abolish the wages councils was purely ideological on the part of the government. We have legal minimum rates at the moment without any detrimental effects on inflation, and giving low-paid workers a decent increase will make very little difference.

                    <span>With help from mouse-turned-footman James Corden and a genderqueer fairy godparent, Camila Cabello‚Äôs Ella gets to go to the ball in an outfit of her own creation
This musical Cinderella‚Äôs stodgy online trailer fluffed the snark glands of social media, with its warbly American Idol-style cover versions and the presence of producer-actor James Corden in a comedy mouse-turned-footman supporting role. There may even have been some unkind overexcitement at the thought of a new Cats-level debacle. But no. Actually, writer-director Kay Cannon‚Äôs new Cinderella isn‚Äôt bad, and Camila Cabello makes a rather personable lead, carrying off some of the movie‚Äôs generous helping of funny lines. Doesn‚Äôt she want to go to the ball, testily inquires genderqueer fairy godparent Fab G, played by Billy Porter. ‚ÄúYes, I was just crying and singing about it,‚Äù says Cinderella thoughtfully.
Cinderella lives in a quaint Disney-National-Trust village in a vast cottage with her horrid step- (not ‚Äúugly‚Äù, please) sisters Anastasia (Maddie Baillio) and Drizella (Charlotte Spencer) and fierce stepmother Vivian (Idina Menzel), whose own revisionist third-act redemption is visible a mile away. (They surely missed a trick by not calling her a ‚Äúconservator‚Äù.) Our heroine is actually called Ella: her association with ‚Äúcinders‚Äù is explained, but she never has to scrape out a real fire, nor is one ever lit.

Spike Lee is no stranger to controversy, but pre-emption is new for him. His incendiary work has inspired scandals both righteous (Do the Right Thing frightened a complacent America with its vision of urban unrest) and regrettable (the Jewish club owners in Mo‚Äô Better Blues attracted charges of antisemitism), and now, his new docuseries NYC Epicenters 9/11 ‚Äî&gt; 2021¬Ω has landed him in the same hot water that never seems to cool.

The previous US administration of Donald Trump signalled support for Israel‚Äôs claim on Jerusalem as its capital by moving its embassy there from Tel Aviv and subsuming the consulate in that mission.

Without help for oil-producing countries, net zero by 2050 is a distant dream

 The finance minister of Iraq, one of the founding members of the global oil cartel Opec, has made an unprecedented call to fellow oil producers to move away from fossil fuel dependency and into renewable energy, ahead of a key Opec meeting.
Ali Allawi, who is also the deputy prime minister of Iraq, has written in the Guardian to urge oil producers to pursue ‚Äúan economic renewal focused on environmentally sound policies and technologies‚Äù that would include solar power and potentially nuclear reactors, and reduce their dependency on fossil fuel exports.

The hub, which will host scientists and policymakers from around the globe on a project-by-project basis, is designed to make it easier for governments to compare notes on emerging infectious diseases and pull in additional relevant information on travel patterns, trade routes or human-animal interactions in agriculture.

                    <span>To meet climate targets and avoid economic collapse, countries such as Iraq need international support in the transition to clean energy
‚Ä¢ Ali Allawi is deputy prime minister and finance minister of Iraq. Fatih Birol is executive director of the International Energy Agency
In the Middle East and north Africa, global warming is not a distant threat, but an already painful reality. Rising temperatures are exacerbating water shortages. In Iraq, temperatures are estimated to be rising as much as seven times faster than the global average. Countries in this region are not only uniquely affected by global temperature rises: their centrality to global oil and gas markets makes their economies particularly vulnerable to the transition away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources. It‚Äôs essential the voices of Iraq and similar countries are heard at the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow this November.
To stand a chance of limiting the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it produces and consumes energy, burning less coal, oil and natural gas. The International Energy Agency‚Äôs recent global roadmap to net zero by 2050 shows the world‚Äôs demand for oil will need to decline from more than 90m barrels a day to less than 25m by 2050. This would result in a 75% plunge in net revenues for oil-producing economies, many of which are dominated by a public sector that relies on oil exports and the revenues they produce.

My husband and I have been together for 16 years and have two kids. He recently told me he‚Äôs bisexual. I was  shocked and feel uncomfortable thinking of him having sex with men. I am not homophobic, but I just didn‚Äôt think my husband liked men. After asking him if he has urges he needs to fulfil, he said maybe bisexual was the wrong word and that he‚Äôs just attracted to the male physique. I feel like now he‚Äôs not being completely honest. I‚Äôm also worried that he will want to have sex with men and not want me as much. 
It is never easy for a person to come out, and it can be equally hard for a partner to learn that his sexual orientation may be different from what it seemed. Try not to ‚Äúcatastrophise‚Äù this situation. Your partner married you, and you have so far been confident about his desire for you. Nothing has really changed ‚Äì he has simply tried to share something important about who he truly is. Whether he will want to act on his interest in men is a separate matter that may need to be discussed and negotiated at some later point and I understand that that may seem threatening to you.

The attack followed mass shootings by white supremacists ‚Äì like in El Paso in 2019 and a Pittsburgh synagogue the year before ‚Äì and relatively unpoliced public violence by far-right militants at rallies across the country since Donald Trump‚Äôs election.
The Biden administration now seeks to turn the attention of the post-9/11 counterterrorism enterprise toward ‚Äúdomestic violent extremists‚Äù. But in making this shift, it is vital that we learn from our mistakes rather than simply repeating them. Already officials are headed down the same problematic path we took 20 years ago, considering proposals to expand counterterrorism authorities and using ideology as an indicator of potential violence.

A former student who downloaded almost 70,000 white supremacist documents and bomb-making instructions has avoided a prison sentence ‚Äúby the skin of his teeth‚Äù after being told to read classic literature by Dickens, Austen, Shakespeare and Hardy.
Ben John, 21, from Lincoln, a former student at De Montfort University in Leicester, has to return to court every four months to be tested on his reading, Judge Timothy Spencer QC said. He also sentenced him to a suspended two years‚Äô imprisonment plus a further two years on licence.

                    <span>Daphne was a starving stray who became a loving family pet. When the dogcatcher gave chase, I realised the entire school was rooting for my dog
The dog had followed us to school, a walk of about half a mile. This was not unusual ‚Äì the dog followed us to school almost every day. Generally, she would sit in the playground for a while before going back home. Sometimes she stayed to interfere with games. On at least one occasion, she entered the building and wandered the halls until she found my brother‚Äôs classroom.
My father had picked up this dog as a starving stray outside his office a couple of years earlier. It was black with orange marks where eyebrows would be; skinny, highly strung, loyal and ungovernable. My father named her Daphne.

Yet Hill was not surprised that the wastewater pipe built in the 1940s had succumbed to corrosion. ‚ÄúHere we go again,‚Äù she thought grimly.

Los Angeles has seen volatile protests almost every weekend this summer over trans rights, political opposition to masks and vaccines, and the recall of the Democratic governor. At least seven journalists have been physically assaulted while covering these rallies, six of them by rightwing demonstrators.
Attacks on the press are just one part of escalating rightwing street violence in the city, which has included multiple stabbings, people being sprayed in the face with bear Mace, an assault on a breast cancer patient outside a clinic, and repeated physical brawls with leftwing protesters in the streets. In another sign of growing tensions, protesters rallying against vaccine mandates showed up at the homes of two Los Angeles city council members on Sunday.

It was December 2020 and Janet (not her real name), a 53-year-old IT consultant from Edinburgh, was doing her weekly shop in the Sainsbury‚Äôs closest to her house. In went the toilet roll, meat and vegetables. She wheeled her trolley on to the feminine hygiene aisle and saw a pair of period knickers. They were ¬£12.
Janet frowned and considered. She had heard about period underwear; a friend raved about her Thinx. Janet had even been on the Thinx website, but the cheapest pair, with delivery, were more than ¬£30. ‚ÄúIt was quite a lot of money if I didn‚Äôt like them,‚Äù she says. She was doubtful that the knickers would even work for someone who was perimenopausal and had recently gone back to using sanitary towels for the first time since she was a teenager because she found it too uncomfortable to wear a tampon.

Listen to our podcast: Can we really solve the climate crisis by planting trees? ‚Äì part one

Thomas Crowther understands more than most the danger of simple, optimistic messages about combating the climate crisis. In July 2019, the British ecologist co-authored a study estimating that Earth had space for an extra trillion trees on land not used for agriculture or settlement. Its implications were intoxicatingly hopeful. By restoring forests in an area roughly the size of China, the press release accompanying the paper suggested two-thirds of all emissions from human activities still present in the atmosphere could be removed. 
The study, led by Jean-Fran√ßois Bastin, a postdoctoral researcher at Crowther‚Äôs lab in ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland, was the second most featured climate paper in the media in 2019, according to one analysis. It inspired the World Economic Forum‚Äôs (WEF) One Trillion Trees Initiative, launched last year after Salesforce billionaire Marc Benioff read the paper on the recommendation of Al Gore, the former US vice-president. The Time magazine owner told everyone he could about the research: chief executives, friends and world leaders, even convincing climate sceptic Donald Trump to back the WEF initiative with a multibillion tree commitment.

It was an October morning, 2016, and I was about to go to a lecture. But my heart sank in that moment: it was the kind of call that can only signal tragedy. My father had a heart condition ‚Äì cardiomyopathy ‚Äì and I knew that the offer to take me to the station meant he was certainly dead.

At a time when all life‚Äôs challenges have been amplified by the pandemic ‚Äì and awareness of burnout, at home and at work, has never been higher ‚Äì stress might seem to be our baseline condition. For most of us, these periods of pressure pass relatively quickly. Even serious stress can be temporary and, given the chance to recover, we usually will. ‚ÄúBut emotional resilience won‚Äôt solve everything,‚Äù says Rachel Boyd, from the mental health charity Mind. ‚ÄúSome of the causes of stress are very challenging to cope with, even when we feel OK.‚Äù
Many of our everyday challenges have been amplified by the pandemic and its consequences for the economy and society. Those living with financial hardship, health conditions, or caregiving responsibilities, in particular, may feel there is no end in sight. But even if stress seems essential to your circumstances and you don‚Äôt have the option or the resources to change them, there are ways you can support yourself.

Coal burning is the principal culprit, the researchers said, and India is worst affected, with the average citizen dying six years early. China has slashed air pollution in the last seven years, but dirty air is still cutting 2.6 years from its people‚Äôs lifespan.

Ahmad ‚Äì not his real name ‚Äì left Afghanistan after the US invasion began in 2001. He sought asylum in the UK, and eventually settled in Glasgow, finally becoming a citizen last year.
But his wife and children live in Kabul. In August, with his wife heavily pregnant, he flew back to be with them, believing there would be time to bring them back to the UK if anything went wrong. But the baby was born even as the Taliban began to seize control of Afghanistan‚Äôs cities.

The treatment, inclisiran, works by boosting the liver‚Äôs ability to reduce the body‚Äôs level of ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol, even in those who have already tried using statins.

Between a third and half of the world‚Äôs wild tree species are threatened with extinction, posing a risk of wider ecosystem collapse, the most comprehensive global stocktake to date warns.
Forest clearance for farming is by far the biggest cause of the die-off, according to the State of the World‚Äôs Trees report, which was released on Wednesday along with a call for urgent action to reverse the decline.

Tucked away in a courtyard in the City of London, surrounded by glass, steel and concrete skyscrapers, is a historic and religious gem: the oldest synagogue in the UK.
On Friday evenings, at the start of the Jewish sabbath, it takes 45 minutes to light up to 240 candles in the original chandeliers hanging from the ceiling of the 320-year-old building.

                    <span>This BBC show about Miri‚Äôs return home after 18 years in prison is a pure and painful delight, which can move you from tears to laughter within a single line
We pick up with thirtysomething ex-con Miri Matteson (played by Daisy Haggard, co-creator of this comedy-drama with Laura Solon) for the second series of Back to Life (BBC Three/iPlayer) just a few weeks on from when we left her. She is now six weeks into life as a free woman ‚Äì bar her mandatory meetings with her probation officer, Janice (Jo Martin, still lethally brilliant in a part that has been beefed up this go-round, surely in recognition of everything she did the first time) ‚Äì and things are ... OK. Miri is keeping her Tamagotchi alive, is taking driving lessons, is about to start a trial run as a supermarket employee and is still friends-with-benefits with neighbour Billy (Adeel Akhtar). The benefits are basically food-based (or, as Janice puts it, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even seen his cocky yet‚Äù). After last series‚Äô ice-cream cones, they move on in the first episode of the new to a sandwich lunch on the freezing Hythe shoreline. But the oh-so-gradual evolution of this, the daftest, tenderest relationship on television, is what makes it such a pure and painful delight. It manages to crush and swell the heart all at once.
On the other hand, Miri is still trying to come to terms with the revelations about her best friend Mandy‚Äôs (Christine Bottomley) involvement in the crime for which Miri served 18 years in prison, and her mother‚Äôs adulterous affair with Miri‚Äôs ex-boyfriend Dom (Jamie Michie); all while learning how to use the internet and smartphones, and restoring a bank account she hasn‚Äôt used for two decades.

                    <span>This remarkable documentary shows exactly how 9/11 unfolded for George W Bush, from the multiple prayer breaks to the anti-anthrax pills ‚Äì and the vow to ‚Äòkick ass‚Äô before he knew whose ass to kick
There is a particular kind of political documentary that tries to put us ‚Äúin the room‚Äù, to tell us how historic decisions were made and how the fallible humans who made them felt. But on 11 September 2001, when planes hijacked by al-Qaida terrorists destroyed the twin towers of New York‚Äôs World Trade Center and took the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans, the chaos was such that there was no single ‚Äúroom‚Äù. President George W Bush and his advisers, afraid for their own safety and constantly searching for information, were on the move all day and had to conduct their business in airbase bunkers, the back room of a school and aboard the president‚Äôs jet, Air Force One.
Nevertheless, 9/11: Inside the President‚Äôs War Room (BBC One) gives the sensation of being in the room in a way that few documentaries ever have. That day has often been described as a disaster movie no screenwriter would dare imagine. Here, it is a horrifyingly tragic but also propulsive story, with twin narratives following the president‚Äôs movements and the developing carnage on the ground, minute by minute.

IhumƒÅtao contains evidence of New Zealand‚Äôs first commercial gardens, where thousands of hectares were planted with kumara, a tropical sweet potato which thrived in the warm and nutritious soil. The adjacent stonefields, today a category one Unesco heritage site, are rich with ancient nurseries and storage pits. When William Hobson, then-governor of New Zealand, founded Auckland in 1840, the produce of IhumƒÅtao sustained the growing population.

Kenya‚Äôs defence minister, Monica Juma, was nominated on Tuesday for the post in a surprise move, which came despite the fact no date is yet set for the next Commonwealth summit ‚Äì the likely backdrop for any attempt to try to force out Scotland.

                    <span>Opening T20 international is reportedly a sellout in Essex
‚ÄòWe hope it has drawn a lot more people in,‚Äô says batter

Sophia Dunkley says she is hopeful that the record crowds for women‚Äôs cricket during the Hundred will transfer into increased interest in England‚Äôs series against New Zealand, which begins on Wednesday with a Twenty20 at Chelmsford.
Chelmsford is rumoured to be a sellout, but the Essex ground has long been a hotbed of support for the women‚Äôs game. The remainder of the series ‚Äì two further T20s followed by five one-day internationals ‚Äì will prove the real test, amid questions about the extent to which the Hundred has successfully served as a gateway into other formats for its new audience.

‚ÄòMy focus is to win silverware at Tottenham,‚Äô says striker

Harry Kane has insisted his conscience is clear after his unsuccessful attempts to force a move from Tottenham to Manchester City.
Kane, who is poised to captain England in their World Cup qualifier against Hungary on Thursday night, made clear that he had no regrets about trying to engineer a move. The striker‚Äôs hopes of a lucrative transfer fell through after the Premier League champions decided not to meet Spurs‚Äô ¬£150m asking price, but he is confident the saga has not tarnished his reputation.

ValueAct Capital was judged to have constructive ideas and useful industry expertise. The four-year relationship, which ran until 2019, turned out harmoniously.
Causeway Capital Management, the latest US fund with a 9% stake, looks a different beast, at least to judge by its comments to the FT at the weekend. The striking feature was the wooly nature of its main grumble: a demand for a board ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù in the interests of ‚Äúfresh thinking‚Äù. What does that mean?

Imposing vaccine passports is likely to make hesitant people even more reluctant to get Covid jabs, research involving more than 16,000 people has found as Downing Street vowed to press ahead with the plan within a month.
Boris Johnson announced in July that the government would make it compulsory for nightclubs and other crowded indoor venues to ensure customers have been fully vaccinated before allowing them entry.

British sources have said a ‚Äújoint decision‚Äù was taken with the US to keep Kabul airport‚Äôs Abbey gate open before last week‚Äôs terror attack, in an attempt to dispel a leaked claim from the Pentagon that it was done on behalf of the UK.
The effort to smooth over transatlantic differences comes at a time of growing political concern over the US-UK relationship, and in response to an unusually detailed insider account of Pentagon decision-making.

The furlough scheme should be extended to protect workers in industries that continue to be damaged by the pandemic, business groups and unions have said as the job subsidy programme that has supported more than 11 million employees entered its final month.
Aviation industry workers and staff at Britain‚Äôs airports should be allowed to remain on furlough until next year when travel restrictions are likely to be lifted and the airline industry returns to normal, they said.

On the ninth day of XR‚Äôs latest protest campaign, the Guardian witnessed officers from the Metropolitan police climb the sides of the bus parked across the junction at the south of the bridge, striking and wrestling with protesters.

                    <span>After almost 20 years, America has ended its longest war. But its duties to Afghans endure
The histories are already being written, but for now, two moments encapsulate the closing moments of America‚Äôs longest war. One was the eerie, lonely night-vision image of the last US soldier boarding the military‚Äôs final flight from Afghanistan. The other came a day earlier, when a retaliatory strike targeting Islamic State reportedly claimed the lives of 10 civilians, including at least six children. Together, they convey the sense of hopelessness and waste, after almost 20 years and $2tn, the carelessness which too often characterised both the US presence and its withdrawal, and the costs to Afghans.
Though Donald Trump set the clock for departure ticking, Joe Biden‚Äôs timing owed more to symbolism than pragmatism. The president promised that the US military would leave before 11 September ‚Äì the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terrorist attacks that led the US to topple the Taliban.

                    <span>The balance of power in less well-paid sectors is changing for the better. Labour can benefit
The first Covid lockdown inspired an outpouring of gratitude towards the key workers who kept the show on the road, while the rest of us remained indoors. But the weekly applause on doorsteps gradually faded away, as the nation found itself digging in for the long haul. The economic balance of power that had led to low levels of pay for people doing highly valued jobs remained fundamentally unchanged.
Well over a year later, the delivery drivers, food production workers and other employees vital to Britain‚Äôs supply chains are back in the headlines. As parliament prepares to return from recess next week, a combination of the pandemic and the effects of Brexit has made labour shortages in these sectors one of the central stories of the summer. And for the first time in decades, it seems the politics of work and the balance of power in the labour market may be changing. Last month, the Unite union won a higher pay rise for beer delivery drivers after threatening strike action. Online shopping deliveries from companies such as Asos and Argos may be delayed if DHL workers vote to reject a 1% pay rise and take industrial action. Meanwhile, an array of bonuses, incentives and inducements is being offered by businesses in an attempt to persuade people to work for them.

                    <span>Jeremy Morris oversaw sexual harassment complaints against don who was readmitted despite student contact ban
The master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge University, has resigned over an allegation that he mishandled sexual harassment complaints, after an independent inquiry recommended the college initiate disciplinary action. 
Jeremy Morris oversaw a sexual harassment case in 2019, in which Cambridge don Peter Hutchinson was readmitted to his college less than two years after he had been permanently excluded and banned from contacting students after an internal investigation. 
Hutchinson, who had been accused of nearly a dozen incidents of inappropriate behaviour between 2014 and 2015, regained some college privileges when he automatically became an emeritus professor after his retirement.
The college provoked widespread ire among staff and students in 2019 when it defended its decision to restore Hutchinson‚Äôs access to the college for certain college events and to exercise his dining rights on grounds that the original decision to remove him in 2017 had ‚Äúnot been agreed with Dr Hutchinson and was incorrect‚Äù.
Trinity Hall responded to the backlash by commissioning an independent inquiry led by Gemma White QC into the college‚Äôs handling of the allegations against Hutchinson.

Twenty years, tens of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars separated the arrival of the first US troops on Afghan soil after 9/11 and the Taliban‚Äôs triumphant restoration in the Afghan capital.

In 1970, she was even on the Broadway stage in Georgy, starring as the awkward, dowdy title character, played by Lynn Redgrave in the film version, Georgy Girl, four years earlier. She received a Tony award nomination as best actress in a musical, despite the production proving a flop and closing after only four performances at the Winter Garden theatre.

                    <span>Governor Ralph Northam said the men, tried by all-white juries, were not given due process at a time when only Black men received death sentences for rape in Virginia
The governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, has granted posthumous pardons to seven Black men who were executed in 1951 for the rape of a white woman.
The case attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty.

                    <span>Soviet dissident who sacrificed his scientific career and was imprisoned for denouncing the state‚Äôs abuse of human rights
Alone among Soviet dissidents of the Leonid Brezhnev years, Sergei Kovalev, who has died aged 91, went on to play a major role in the eras of Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, only to find that his outspoken support for human rights put him once again in opposition to the Russian government.
Kovalev had already sacrificed a scientific career in the late 1960s to speak out against the Soviet state‚Äôs abuse of human rights and was one of the leading campaigners to be imprisoned under Brezhnev. Appointed against strong opposition as chairman of the Russian parliament‚Äôs human rights commission in 1990, and human rights ombudsman in 1994, he was forced to resign following a series of brave and damning reports from Chechnya in 1995. A quiet, almost self-effacing man, he became the hero of the internal opposition to the genocidal war.

After four years of court battles, protests and celebrity interventions, Geronimo, the UK‚Äôs most divisive alpaca, has been put down by government officials.
The eight-year-old animal, who had tested positive twice for bovine tuberculosis and whose fate triggered heated debate across the country, was taken from his home at Shepherds Close Farm in south Gloucestershire on Tuesday.

Thank you, Rachel Clarke, for highlighting the disturbing emerging reality of the so-called New Hospital Programme (For a doctor, the Tories‚Äô empty promises on hospitals are soul-destroying, 23 August). Just look at West Hertfordshire NHS trust, one of eight in the first wave of NHP projects. When Boris Johnson visited Watford hospital in October 2019, he claimed the area would soon have ‚Äúworld-class facilities‚Äù. But it is not turning out like that.
The trust‚Äôs preferred option is for a new hospital facility to be housed in three tower blocks in a heavily congested and inaccessible spot, next to the current Watford hospital. Other local hospitals would get minimal investment. The trust‚Äôs choice has zero chance of being approved by the government. It will cost more than ¬£900m, well over any budget ‚Äì a unicorn hospital.

The letter on nuclear energy (25 August) sadly could not be more wrong ‚Äì nuclear is one of the cleanest fuels we have, and has always been so. The carbon and material footprints of nuclear ‚Äì for its entire lifetime, including mining and decommissioning ‚Äì are lower than solar and on a par with wind, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Moreover, the nuclear industry manages its waste stream ‚Äì that is more than can be said for the solar industry, which is set to produce millions of tons of toxic waste. Besides, spent nuclear fuel is not ‚Äúwaste‚Äù but a valuable source of low-carbon energy that can be recycled via reprocessing or proposed breeder reactors, thereby neutralising the vast majority of the radioactivity.

What won‚Äôt Boris Johnson do next? A new political season is about to get under way, and the prime minister‚Äôs agenda is packed with choices to defer and challenges to duck.
There is always a back-to-school atmosphere at Westminster in the autumn, but it will be intensified this year by the resumption of parliamentary business unmuffled by Covid restrictions. The recall of MPs for a debate on Afghanistan in the middle of August was a reminder that politics has missed the volatile energy generated by a heaving Commons.

Along with the near-simultaneous Toronto film festival, Venice has traditionally marked the end of the summer blockbuster film season and the arrival of films aiming for critical praise and subsequent awards recognition. Spencer is due to be joined at Venice by Dune, the long-gestating adaptation of Frank Herbert‚Äôs mammoth sci-fi novel directed by Denis Villeneuve; Ridley Scott‚Äôs medieval drama The Last Duel, starring Matt Damon, Adam Driver and Jodie Comer; horror-thriller Last Night in Soho, directed by Edgar Wright; and Parallel Mothers, the latest from Spanish auteur Pedro Almod√≥var.

                    <span>Yet another Before Sunrise imitator ‚Äì this time with two men who have 15 hours to spend together in Berlin ‚Äì falters because of a subpar script and annoying characters
Richard Linklater has a lot to answer for. Ever since Before Sunrise, countless indie films have tried to ape the incandescent spirit of that 1995 classic, usually to middling results. Daniel Sanchez Lopez‚Äôs Boy Meets Boy is the latest unfortunately failed attempt, and once again reveals the achilles heel of these copycat projects. Before Sunrise might appear improvised but it has a tightly constructed script. Without good writing, watching random people walking around rarely makes for a good time at the movies.
At least the chosen location is charming enough. Having locked eyes the previous night at a club, Johannes (Alexandros Koutsoulis) and Harry (Matthew James Morrison), wander about on a sun-drenched day in Berlin, before the latter‚Äôs flight back to the UK. It‚Äôs the kind of brief encounter where the goodbyes pre-exist the hellos: the young men know they only have 15 hours together. Most of their conversations are spontaneous ‚Äì or try to be; they range from family life and jobs to, later, more personal subjects such as monogamy and open relationships. The issues discussed are interesting yet the subpar writing renders the pair‚Äôs opinions inconsequential, if not outright annoying. ‚ÄúQuirky‚Äù moments, such as Harry showing a film clip by Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl, only induce eyerolls.

But when Joshua Rof√© got to work as director, he plunged into a maze of ugly legal disputes, interviewees too scared to go on the record and bitter wrangling over Ross‚Äôs legacy.

In a new written statement, John Lydon has responded with worry and dismay after losing a court case over the use of music by the Sex Pistols in an upcoming TV series, directed by Danny Boyle.
Lydon, known as Johnny Rotten during his time fronting the punk band, had been sued by drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones after Lydon prevented the use of Pistols songs in the series Pistol. Lydon lost the case, with a judge ruling that Jones and Cook were allowed to overrule him using a majority rule created in the terms of a band agreement.

After that, the political activist decided it wasn‚Äôt safe to stay home. ‚ÄúHe went to his cousin‚Äôs house in H2 [an area of Hebron city controlled by the Israeli military] because he hoped Fatah and the PA could not reach him there, but he knew they were coming for him,‚Äù said Jihan, Banat‚Äôs widow, as she hugged their youngest son in the family‚Äôs reception room in the village of Dura.

Based on actual events, this film from Israeli brothers Doron and Yoav Paz dramatises an astonishing piece of Holocaust history: a deadly plot by a small group of Jewish survivors to poison the water supply in Nuremberg. ‚ÄúAn eye for an eye. Six million for six million.‚Äù It‚Äôs a handsome-looking, decently acted film, but unpersuasive and fundamentally lightweight, the material packaged a little too neatly into a conventional easy-to-consume movie in which characters purposefully stride in slo-mo across rooms. Characters speaking in accented English don‚Äôt help.
It‚Äôs 1945 and former death camp inmate Max (August Diehl), face gaunt, eyes red-rimmed, walks half-starved back to his village in Germany to search for his missing wife and son. The man now living in his house is a former neighbour. He pulls a gun on Max. ‚ÄúJust because the war is over it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt kill Jews anymore,‚Äù he barks, a bit flatly. Like a lot of the scenes here, it doesn‚Äôt generate a sense of enough at stake.

Jeff Buckley had released two live EPs (Live at Sin-eÃÅ in 1993 and Live from the Bataclan in 1995) plus one complete studio album (Grace in 1994) before he died in 1997. Since his death, eight live albums and multiple compilation albums have been released, spanning music recorded while he was signed to Sony and also before he had a record deal.
The most contentious is Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, which was released a year after his death. Buckley had already scrapped a batch of recordings produced by Tom Verlaine in late 1996 and early 1997 and was preparing to record afresh in Memphis, the place where he drowned in the Mississippi.

                    <span>Agatha Christie‚Äôs beloved sleuth to return in new authorised collection featuring contemporary writers including Dreda Say Mitchell, Kate Mosse and Val McDermid
Miss Marple was last seen in 1976, solving a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù crime committed years earlier in Agatha Christie‚Äôs Sleeping Murder. Now authors including Val McDermid, Naomi Alderman and Dreda Say Mitchell are set to continue the adventures of the elderly amateur sleuth, with the first ever ‚Äúnew‚Äù Agatha Christie short story collection out next year.
The 12 writers, who also include Kate Mosse, Elly Griffiths and Ruth Ware, are all ‚ÄúChristie devotees‚Äù, said publisher HarperCollins, and will reimagine Miss Marple ‚Äúthrough their own unique perspective while staying true to the hallmarks of a traditional mystery‚Äù.

                    <span>In the vacuum left by the US, regional politics between Iran, UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia is bound to become more messy
As the US military finally leaves Afghanistan after 20 years, all eyes are rightly on the human tragedy and the political implications of the Taliban‚Äôs return to power. But to understand what may come next for both Afghanistan and the world, more attention needs to be paid to the tectonic shifts in the Arab and Iranian involvement in Afghanistan since the US-led invasion in 2001. Unless the regional contests for influence are accompanied by substantive and inclusive dialogue between these actors, turmoil will only increase for the country.
Iran‚Äôs changing role is a case in point. Tehran was once eager to get rid of the Taliban. In 1998, the killing of diplomats at the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif almost ignited a war. The murders took place in the chaos of the Taliban‚Äôs capture of the northern Afghan city. Tehran thus put the blame on the Taliban, which in turn pinned it on rogue elements. So it was unconventional ‚Äì but certainly not odd ‚Äì when Iran and the US emerged as implicit partners against the Taliban in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Tehran and Washington jointly backed the Northern Alliance ‚Äì an alliance of warlords that held 10% of Afghanistan ‚Äì as an anti-Taliban force.

                    <span>Extra-high heels are having a moment, from Beyonc√© to Olivia Rodrigo. Could they mark a return to an era of prosperity?
You will have heard of the hemline index. It was first theorised in 1926 by the economist George Taylor, and stated that skirts get shorter during times of financial prosperity and longer in a recession. But could a parallel theory work for women‚Äôs shoes? As we approach an era of Covid measures relaxing and spending gradually increasing, can the height of your heels be a good economic predictor of a boom or bust era?
The exaggerated heel has been trending (a possible harbinger for the so-called roaring 20s) while the hashtag #pleaserheels (named after the high-arched shoe) has had more than 118m views on TikTok. At the weekend, Beyonc√© paired a black Versace dress with barbie pink jacket and matching pair of super heeled shoes. Earlier in the month, Lady Gaga wore some baby blue body-con athleisure with some extreme platform heels.

                    <span>Today‚Äôs challenges demand radical action. The old orthodoxy of free markets and hands-off government won‚Äôt cut it
As western economies emerge from the pandemic, their governments face a choice: do they seek to address the profound problems that Covid exposed, or try to return to ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù as quickly as possible? Their problem is that many of the issues exacerbated by the pandemic, such as wage stagnation, precarious work and rising inequality are not bugs in an otherwise well-functioning system, but inevitable outcomes of the way that western economies are now organised. So a business-as-usual approach simply won‚Äôt work. Much more fundamental change is needed.
The US government seems to recognise this. Joe Biden‚Äôs economic plans are a radical departure from the era that stretches from Reagan to Obama, when governments sought to keep taxes and public spending low and focused principally on globalised trade and the education and training of the workforce. Unlike his predecessors, Biden is pursuing large-scale public spending and taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to borrow for infrastructure investment. His stimulus plans target the climate crisis while creating green jobs and expanding health, education and childcare ‚Äì the ‚Äúsocial infrastructure‚Äù that is essential to the economy but has often been ignored by mainstream economists.

                    <span>It‚Äôs easy to put off tender discussions, but successfully addressing the most emotional subjects always starts with listening
There‚Äôs a conversation you‚Äôre avoiding. It feels important, the stakes are high, there are strong feelings involved and you are putting it off: ‚ÄúThe time isn‚Äôt right‚Äù; ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find the words‚Äù; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get emotional‚Äù.
But delaying doesn‚Äôt solve anything and anticipation is often far more uncomfortable than the conversation itself. Getting started might involve some awkward moments, but, after that, the situation is open for discussion and exploration.

                    <span>Once a year, we pupils were given total freedom, whether we chose to go to the zoo or get on the dodgems. I decided to surprise my mother with a visit
The best day of my school year was always the same: 29 May. It was known as Founder‚Äôs Day which, in most schools with such pretensions, meant being forced to dress in your best clothes, sing a hymn in Latin and then listen to some old bloke telling you how to live a good and righteous life. Doesn‚Äôt sound promising, does it? Except that at our school, it was different. We may have had the Latin hymn but, after that, we were told we must leave the school and go wherever we wanted (within legal limits, I suppose, though I don‚Äôt ever remember that being spelled out). This may not sound that spectacular, until you realise that this was a school for blind and almost-blind children. 
You were also presented with five shillings, which I suppose was intended as a survival kit, but which we realised could buy 60 penny chews, or a dirty book from the top shelf of the newsagents, which the one boy with a bit of sight could read to you with the aid of a powerful magnifying glass.

Rob and Magpie started out in 1990 when recycling was not really high on the political radar, although there was growing awareness of the amount of waste going into landfill: ‚ÄúThe climate situation has been with us since the 1970s.

                    <span>Probably the most important relaxation of the Covid rules is the chance to properly celebrate a loved one‚Äôs life and all its contradictions

My dad‚Äôs funeral generated a gushing stream of anecdotes. I don‚Äôt remember any feelings at all, just event after event, most of which involved my brother or my dog. The one about my dad‚Äôs best friend is probably the best, but it is too salacious and actionable to tell here. The second-best featured my brother and the dog ‚Äì he left the wake with my sister‚Äôs friend on the pretext of taking Spot for a walk. Whatever they did on this ‚Äúwalk‚Äù held insufficient interest for the dog, who brought himself neatly back home, carrying his own lead, like a cartoon. Realising they‚Äôd lost him, and mindful of what a terrible day that would be to lose a person‚Äôs dog, the frantic couple spent two hours wandering round Ramsgate, calling his name.
The day wasn‚Äôt funny because it was un-sad; my father was 64, and we felt absolutely bilked by the universe ‚Äì robbed blind of two decades of matchless bonhomie. It‚Äôs just that the closer you are to a person, the more absurd you find those rituals that directly follow their deaths. When my uncle died a couple of years later, I read at his funeral, in place of my mother, who didn‚Äôt want to. In a hurry, I just Googled, ‚ÄúWhat to read at funerals.‚Äù When I stood up to solemnly intone the Song from Cymbeline ‚Äì ‚ÄúFear no more the frown o‚Äô the great / Thou art past the tyrant‚Äôs stroke‚Äù ‚Äì it was the first time I‚Äôd ever set eyes on the words. I almost had to stop halfway through, since my uncle was, memorably, a bit of a tyrant, never not frowning, so it sounded as if I was addressing the congregation with a poetic: ‚ÄúEverybody relax, he‚Äôs died.‚Äù The family all found that hilarious, his colleagues, maybe not so much.

                    <span>Now on the UK‚Äôs travel green list, the Portuguese archipelago offers stunning volcanic landscapes and its own delicious cuisine, wines and even coffee
The Azores archipelago (A√ßores in Portuguese) lies about 1,000 miles west of mainland Europe and is made up of nine volcanic islands: S√£o Miguel (the largest), S√£o Jorge, Terceira, Pico, Faial, Ilha das Flores, Santa Maria, Graciosa and Corvo, which you can cross by ferry or plane.
Colonised by the Portuguese in 1432, the Azores is now an autonomous region. During the period known as the Discoveries, Portugal had the largest high-seas fleet in the world, with many of its ships stopping to replenish stocks in the Azores as they travelled back and forth to Brazil, India, Japan and elsewhere, bringing with them spices that changed Azorean cuisine from simple. plain dishes to ones spiced and flavoured with new-world produce, such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes and yams.

Aims for record-breaking 17th medal in Thursday‚Äôs road race

Sarah Storey eclipsed all competition to win her second gold medal of Tokyo 2020 in the C5 time trial on Tuesday morning. In doing so she also drew level with the swimmer Mike Kenny as the most successful British Paralympian of all time.
The Dame finished a minute and a half clear of teammate Crystal Lane-Wright and, at points, was catching the tail of the men‚Äôs race at the Fuji International Speedway circuit, so dominant was her performance. That is standard for Storey, who spoke afterwards of the ‚Äúsingle-mindedness‚Äù that has brought her 16 gold medals to this point and the prospect of another, a record-breaking 17th, in two days‚Äô time.

Former world No 1 eventually falls 2-6, 7-6(7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4

When the US Open revealed that Andy Murray had been drawn in the first round against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the in-form third seed, the reaction from many onlookers was of anguish and pity. Another week, another slice of brutal luck, it was said. In his pre-tournament press conference, Murray was asked about his inability to ‚Äúcatch a break‚Äù.
But this is Andy Murray, still a former world No 1, still the most competitive and dogged person in most rooms he has ever entered, and so he simply took it as a challenge to produce his very best tennis. Astoundingly, that is precisely what he did as he so nearly pulled off a monumental win, leading Tsitsipas by two sets to one before gracefully falling 2-6, 7-6(7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 after four hours and 48 minutes.

The number of solid organ transplants fell dramatically around the world between 2019 and 2020, researchers have found, highlighting the widespread impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on health services and patients.
As the pandemic surged, hospitals were forced to delay potentially life-saving organ transplant surgery, because of resources such as intensive care beds being needed for Covid patients and because of concerns including whether it was safe to treat transplant recipients in hospital.

                    <span>In this riveting drama, Coogan stars as DCI Clive Driscoll, who finally investigates the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence fully, underlining the extra years of agony his parents had to endure
A few lines across the screen sum up the dreadful story so far. ‚ÄúOn 22 April 1993 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack. The police failed to catch his killers. A public inquiry found the Metropolitan police to be incompetent and institutionally racist. In 2006, 13 years after their son‚Äôs murder, his parents are still fighting for justice.‚Äù
We begin in 2006, in ITV‚Äôs new three-part drama Stephen ‚Äì scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce with every ounce of his customary compassion and intelligence. Stephen‚Äôs mother Doreen (Sharlene Whyte) gives a speech at the centre under construction, whose users she hopes will become her boy‚Äôs living legacy, and his father Neville (Hugh Quarshie, who also played him in the award-winning 1999 ITV docu-drama The Murder of Stephen Lawrence) attends yet another meeting with yet another group of reluctant officials, trying to secure a judicial review. They grant him a review of the case instead.

Rampant Warriors end run of five halves without a point

Wigan Warriors reignited their push for a Super League play-off place with victory against the fifth-placed Castleford Tigers on a day which could have huge ramifications on the race for the top six.
Following a disastrous run of recent form during which Adrian Lam‚Äôs side failed to score a point in the last five halves of rugby they had played, the Warriors knew another defeat here could have left them slipping to sixth, and increase the risk of them missing out on the play-offs. Instead, they ended the day in fourth with three rounds to go and are now a strong bet to avoid a late scramble to make the top six.

Afghanistan: live updates

MPs are scrambling to rescue more than 7,000 constituents and family members trapped in Afghanistan, according to figures provided to the Guardian, dwarfing the only estimates provided by the government of the number left behind.
Scores of Labour MPs have been inundated with pleas for help from thousands of constituents whose relatives have been left stranded since the UK‚Äôs final emergency airlift left Kabul following the country‚Äôs rapid fall to the Taliban. Among them are children, disabled relatives and people who face persecution due to their work, all with potential eligibility to be resettled in Britain.

Given that Real Madrid were formally established in 2020 and are competing in Europe for the first time, the absence of Bronze and White, following knee surgery and an unspecified medical procedure respectively, should not make too much difference to the outcome at the Alfredo Di St√©fano Stadium.

                    <span>Strategic failure has drastically reduced the west‚Äôs ability to influence the future course of events
As the final evacuation flights leave Kabul, watched in despair by those abandoned and in peril, the lasting consequences of strategic failure must now be faced. During the Doha peace talks, American diplomats liked to talk of a process towards an inclusive political settlement that would be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. The ‚Äúprocess‚Äù turned out instead to be a victory procession for the Taliban. What comes now will therefore be Taliban-led and Taliban-owned. Hamstrung as a result of their own mistakes, the United States, Britain and their allies have little choice but to engage with the new reality.
Belated attempts are being made to do so from a supposed position of strength. As the last British forces left Kabul at the weekend, Boris Johnson adopted a stentorian tone to warn: ‚ÄúIf the new regime ‚Ä¶ wants diplomatic recognition or to unlock the billions currently frozen, they will have to ensure safe passage for those who wish to leave the country, to respect the rights of women and girls, [and] to prevent Afghanistan becoming again an incubator for global terror.‚Äù It seems clear that Taliban leaders hope to avoid the international pariah status of the 1990s and will soon be in desperate need of cash. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have suspended payments to Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, and the Afghan central bank‚Äôs reserves are frozen in the US. But the notion that, as China and Russia pursue their own agendas, the west can continue to call the shots and impose its terms is wishful thinking.

The American physicist Richard Feynman thought that ‚Äúnobody understands quantum mechanics‚Äù. That is no longer true. Smartphones, nuclear plants, medical scans and laser-operated doors have been built with insights from the physics that governs the subatomic level. What perplexes many is that the quantum world is governed by rules that run counter to classical notions of physical laws.
In quantum mechanics, nature is not deterministic. Subatomic particles do not travel a path that can be plotted. It is possible only to calculate the probability of finding these specks at a particular point. Where such calculations leave physics, that hardest of the hard sciences, has troubled its greatest minds. Albert Einstein thought the idea that an element of chance lay deep in science was absurd. ‚ÄúGod does not play dice,‚Äù he famously declared.

Larry Elliott (So what‚Äôs so wrong with labour shortages driving up low wages?‚Äô, 29 August) doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that there are upwards wage pressures everywhere from Germany to Singapore and from Norway to America ‚Äì in other words, in places that didn‚Äôt have Brexit. Moreover, moribund wage growth afflicted all of the advanced economies following the global financial crisis, not just the UK.
Second, it is true that migration correlated with a negative effect on low-paid occupations. However, that effect is tightly contextualised in terms of numbers of new occupational entrants and is consistently reported as being small. Compared to the effects of the financial crisis, the immigrant effect is very small indeed ‚Äì as all the research shows. Perhaps tackling the underlying causes of low pay in tight labour markets rather than celebrating the removal of workers for being here in the wrong numbers might be more productive.

                    <span>Ian Harvey urges the JCVI to vaccinate teenagers as schools return from the summer break, and Austen Lynch says the Covid death toll is still high
Scientific advice to the government has mostly been good during the pandemic, but the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is showing unhelpful signs of procrastination over the vaccination of teenagers and the use of adult boosters (Report, 27 August). It is also playing out its discussion via the media rather than in a timely fashion in private. Its doubts about vaccinating teenagers are said to centre on concerns about side-effects, the ethics of indirect benefit and of using vaccines here rather than overseas. The mRNA vaccines that would be used in this group have an excellent safety profile, and are the least suitable for use in developing countries because of storage temperature requirements. Boys are already vaccinated against rubella for the benefit of others (ie pregnant women). The debate is reminiscent of the early hesitation about mask wearing, where some scientists swerved away from their use on the plausible but unlikely grounds of other unintended effects on behaviour. These were not realised, and most of us now regret the delay in mask wearing. I would urge the JCVI to realise that time is not on its side if an autumn campaign is to be organised.

‚Ä¢ Re Devi Sridhar‚Äôs article (For most of the world, the pandemic is not over, 29 August), while recognising that the Delta variant of Covid is causing major problems throughout the world, the perception that it ‚Äúfeels for most people [here], the pandemic is over‚Äù, as it has fallen from the front pages, is to ignore the reality of the current situation.

                    <span>Pen Farthing got his animals out. But the evacuation is a gift to extremists who claim the UK holds foreign lives in contempt
As the gates of hell closed on Kabul, they were among the last to make it out. They landed in the early hours of Sunday morning, to a hero‚Äôs welcome from some, and shamed silence from others. For this was a planeload not of human souls ‚Äì those desperate Afghans who had huddled knee-deep in sewage for days outside the airport in hopes of being saved ‚Äì but of cats and dogs.
The Ministry of Defence confirmed, through audibly gritted teeth, that the private plane chartered to bring back former soldier turned animal rescuer Paul ‚ÄúPen‚Äù Farthing and his menagerie of strays had been ‚Äúassisted‚Äù through the airport by British troops in the final shambolic hours of the retreat from Kabul ‚Äì even as human beings who had put their trust in the western forces they worked alongside were being abandoned to their fate.

The EU has removed six countries, including the US, from a Covid ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù of places whose tourists should be permitted entry without restrictions such as mandatory quarantine.
A majority of EU countries had reopened their borders to Americans in June, in the hope of salvaging the summer tourism season although most required a negative test ahead of travel. The move was not, however, reciprocated by the US.

After humiliation, here ends hubris and surely the ‚Äúglobal Britain‚Äù delusion. No more fatuous boasting, no more ‚Äúworld-beating‚Äù and ‚Äúworld-leading‚Äù, but time for an honest audit of who we are, what we can do, and what we plainly can‚Äôt.
Holed below the waterline, Britain has done itself incalculable reputational damage in recent years. Rescuing Afghan dogs and cats may stand as a global emblem of barking mad Britain. John Casson, a recent ambassador to Egypt, sorrowfully tweets his lifetime Foreign Office goals: leading in the EU; freeing young Arabs from authoritarians; being impactful not transactional in development; and leaving Afghanistan in good shape. All these have failed.

The remarkable Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, who died in 2015 at the age of 106 and made movies right until the very end, often seems to me a film-maker from a statelier, almost pre-cinematic era: an epistolary director or manuscript-culture director. Here is what could be called his testamentary film, a personal cine-memoir or cine-meditation. It was shot in 1982, but withheld from release at the director‚Äôs request until after his death, which would be much further off than anyone imagined. It has only now found a release in the UK.

Anyone who spent the winter lockdown tracking England‚Äôs progressive stagger around India will remember the off‚Äëspinner Ravichandran Ashwin wiping out batting lineups with the ease of a lazy swipe of the monopoly board.
A world-class bowler, the fastest to 300 Test wickets, he has, for tactical reasons, been carrying the drinks around England so far this summer. Following India‚Äôs thrashing by an innings at Headingley, though, the clamour has been growing for him to play in the fourth Test starting on Thursday in south London. It wouldn‚Äôt be his first foray to the Oval this year. He cut quite a dash in his short spell at Surrey in July, when he was signed to replace the injured New Zealand fast bowler Kyle Jamieson when Surrey still had a shot of making Division One and winning the title.

                    <span>The fact he staggered to a club at 1am, red of face and out of place, made me feel an unexpected glimmer of warmth for him
If you had asked me yesterday to imagine a scenario in which I experienced any kind of warmth towards Michael Gove, well ‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt say I couldn‚Äôt have done it, I‚Äôll just say it would have taken some time. But it turns out all he had to do was go to a nightclub in Aberdeen and dance on his own, and not only did I momentarily forget his drawling self-importance, but the people of Scotland did too. You would think the other revellers would have chased him off the dancefloor, pausing only to spray paint him first, like a fur-coat wearer at an animal rights protest. If Aberdeen is famous for anything but granite, it‚Äôs the oil industry ‚Äì and whatever you think of fossil fuels, that means the city is rammed with experts. So Saturday night could have been the perfect opportunity to express that, maybe, they had had enough of Gove.
Instead, they posed for selfies with him, swapped tall tales (did he, or did he not, try to evade the ¬£5 entry fee by saying he was the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster?) and made the man feel like a visiting and esteemed dignitary to the land of trance and bacchanalia. There‚Äôs a Narnia thing, a code of values older than politics; it‚Äôs worse than unkind to mock someone who is dancing ‚Äì it‚Äôs also cynical, joyless and where does it end? You would be like that woman who put a cat in a wheelie bin. What else might she dispose of so casually? Your dreams?

                    <span>The fault lies with western democracy at its most arrogant and interventionist
Who can we blame? There must be someone. When disaster lies all around, democracy craves a culprit, someone to carry the can. This past weekend has seen an orgy of blaming: of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, Dominic Raab (Britain‚Äôs foreign secretary), his ambassadors, Nato and the west generally, not to mention George Bush and Tony Blair. Afghanistan was supposed to be the ‚Äúgood‚Äù intervention, the one that worked. Yet the ‚Äúnation‚Äù we spent 20 years building has suddenly collapsed. Where are the architects?
Victory has many parents, defeat is an orphan. Nothing looked as lonely this past weekend as ‚ÄúAfghan nation-building‚Äù. But whereas tyrants who fail can be toppled, democracy rightly diffuses responsibility. It is all very well accusing Biden or Johnson or their predecessors. We elected them. When things went well, the west trumpeted its values and patted itself on the back. It was so evidently superior.

                    <span>Full findings of 2018 Scottish government inquiry that led to his prosecution reported for first time
A Scottish government inquiry upheld five complaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond, sparking the police investigation that led to his eventual prosecution.
The allegations were made against the former first minister by two female civil servants in early 2018 to an internal government inquiry, which was later struck out by a judge after a legal challenge from Salmond.

The era of leaded petrol is officially over, the UN has announced, eliminating a major threat to human and planetary health.
UN experts have called the use of the fuel, which began in 1922, a ‚Äúcatastrophe for the environment and public health‚Äù. By the 1970s, nearly all petrol produced around the world contained lead. Now the last country to use it, Algeria, has finally stopped selling it in petrol stations.

                    <span>British T64 sprinter finishes level with Johannes Floors
Felix Streng takes gold and Sherman Isidro Guity Guity silver

The clock ticked past three minutes and still there had been no decision. The men‚Äôs T64 100m had certainly been close, with the four leading competitors finishing within four hundredths of a second of one another. But who had claimed bronze between the German Johannes Floors and Britain‚Äôs Jonnie Peacock?
The rules determine that only in the event of a gap of less than 1,000th of a second would two athletes share a place. When the photo finish was eventually called, that was exactly what happened.

Responsible business is all the rage in the City but you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know it: a healthcare company that makes inhalers to treat lung diseases is being sold to big tobacco and Bradford awaits its fate as the homegrown chain Morrisons is circled by US private equity.
To some non-City observers the decisions look wrongheaded and, amid a wave of other takeovers including the sale of the defence contractors Ultra Electronics and Meggitt, suggest that while boards and shareholders talk about their good environmental, social and governance principles, money still talks.

One Sunday afternoon in September, a small group will gather at the Whisby nature reserve near Lincoln to explore its trails and marvel at the wildlife. Before they set off on a two-hour hike, they may fortify themselves with a hot drink and a slice of cake from the cafe; they might apply sunscreen or don waterproofs. One thing they are certain to do is join together in prayer.
This is Lincoln Forest Church, part of a growing network of Christian communities that meet outdoors to worship and engage with the natural world. ‚ÄúWe are a church without walls,‚Äù said Melanie Carroll, who started the group five years ago.

China‚Äôs top diplomat has urged the international community to engage with Afghanistan‚Äôs new Taliban government and ‚Äúguide it actively‚Äù, in a phone call with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.
Wang Yi, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, also said that Washington should work with the international community to help the new regime run governmental functions normally, according to a statement. He added that the US‚Äôs ‚Äúhasty withdrawal‚Äù could allow terrorist groups to ‚Äúregroup and come back stronger‚Äù.

                    <span>There is some sustained brilliance here, but unfortunately it comes from the guest stars ‚Äì and at 108 minutes, this long-awaited album is in need of an edit
Chaotic preview events for Kanye West‚Äôs 10th studio album Donda have dominated social media feeds in recent weeks, each one promising a release date that never materialised. The coverage of the events has focused on Kim Kardashian dressed as a Balenciaga-clad sleep paralysis demon, $50 chicken tenders, potential Drake disses, levitation and cameos from alleged rapist Marilyn Manson and the homophobic DaBaby. Fans called West a genius capable of creating exciting theatre that evolves in real time; others saw him as an empty provocateur. Much like kindred spirit Donald Trump, West seems to instinctively know how to weaponise controversy to drive interest in a new project.
With the eventual release of Donda (named after West‚Äôs English professor mother, who died in 2007), there is a nagging sense the spectacle has overshadowed the actual music, with this bloated 108-minute album rarely sure of what it is trying to say. The intro, Donda Chant, a sequence of eerie recitations of his mother‚Äôs name seemingly designed to send you into a sunken place, is arresting, giving you the impression you‚Äôre about to undergo an immersive religious experience. But too often the songs that follow are built on half-baked ideas from a West more concerned with self-pity and martyrdom than confronting his contradictions.

The mayor of Milan has compared a fire that ripped through a 20-storey residential building on Sunday to the Grenfell Tower blaze in London that killed 72 people four years ago.
The fire, which started on the upper floors of the tower on the southern outskirts of the capital of the Lombardy region, spread to the rest of the building owing to what experts described as the ‚Äúchimney effect‚Äù, which turned the building into a torch.

Closing the Edinburgh international festival after years out of the spotlight, Mvula delivers a triumphant evening of lush 80s soundscapes
Static pours from the speakers on the final night of the Edinburgh international festival. If not for the rolling waves of warmth, rustling like autumn leaves, it could be a soundcheck gone awry. Laura Mvula‚Äôs third album Pink Noise is named after precisely this kind of comforting static and as it builds to a crescendo, a waterfall of sound, Mvula steps out into a brief, awed silence.
This moment has been years in the making. If you Google the Birmingham singer, ‚ÄúWhat happened to Laura Mvula?‚Äù is a suggested search. Her 2013 debut Sing to the Moon was a Mobo-winning, Mercury-nominated triumph, combining her church choir background with a crisp, striking sound. It had legends including Prince, Nile Rodgers and David Byrne clamouring to work with her. In 2017 she won the prestigious Ivor Novello album award for her rich second record The Dreaming Room. But despite the acclaim, Mvula was dropped from her Sony record deal ‚Äì via a forwarded email, no less. She‚Äôs spoken frankly about the crisis of confidence that followed, in herself as an artist as well as in the thought of a future in a plainly exploitative pop industry.

Both the 1964 and the 2021 Paralympics opened in extraordinary circumstances. The first Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were seen as Japan‚Äôs return to the world stage after it resurrected itself from post-war devastation. The current postponed Paralympics are the first to be held during a global pandemic.

                    <span>From Bob Marley to the Congos, Junior Murvin and his own outstanding work on the mic, we celebrate the work of a man who seemed to dissolve time
When I moved to Kingston, Jamaica, in 2003 for a job, it was in the month that Lee ‚ÄúScratch‚Äù Perry won the best reggae album Grammy for Jamaican ET, a record that, in true Scratch style, contained everything including the kitchen sink. I remember tuning in to a call-in radio programme during which Jamaicans were wondering who this guy was. It was not entirely surprising ‚Äì Perry, though arguably the most influential Jamaican artist (and therefore arguably one of the most influential artists ever), is most renowned for his work as producer rather than frontman.
In truth, Perry ‚Äì who has died aged 85 ‚Äì was astoundingly skilled and prolific in both roles, and so it would be laughable to attempt any comprehensive ‚Äúbest of‚Äù or representative listing of Perry‚Äôs work (though you could turn to this good primer by David Katz, author of the exhaustive and essential 2000 biography People Funny Boy: The Genius of Lee ‚ÄúScratch‚Äù Perry). The music he created seems to expand ‚Äì perhaps explode ‚Äì all notions of what music can be, so it is more prudent to pick some standouts that demonstrate his breadth and depth than a definitive greatest hits.

                    <span>Local authorities face resistance to housing plans as residents fight destruction of communal gardens


Protests are growing across London against plans to build thousands of new council homes on green spaces and existing estates.
Local authorities need to build desperately needed homes for social rent but they are facing resistance on the streets and in the courts, as council residents fight the destruction of communal gardens in dense and polluted areas.

                    <span>They have become virtually incapable of seeing any solution to any foreign problem that does not include the barrel of a gun
Some of America‚Äôs most experienced diplomats, politicians and former generals have been saturating the airwaves in the aftermath of the Taliban‚Äôs capture of Kabul issuing dire warnings of what may come next. Many are advocating, even in this final hour, to abandon the withdrawal and return to combat against the Taliban. Such alarmist rhetoric from our senior-most figures does much to explain why America has failed so spectacularly in this war: some of the most influential voices over the past 20 years possess an unhealthy and irrational lust to use war as the first option to solve every foreign problem.
Before 2001, Americans generally thought they were immune from foreign attack. Those beliefs were shattered with the shocking images of the twin towers falling and the Pentagon smoldering on September 11th. In the aftermath, fear and anger descended over the US population. Political leaders and senior military commanders sought to look and sound tough to calm a jittery people.

With thoughts of Covid banished in a blitz of teenage hugging, there are some terrific moments amid this disappointingly male-heavy lineup
‚ÄúWho fancies a party? We‚Äôre all out of the house!‚Äù yells Wolf Alice bassist Theo Ellis as this festival ‚Äì traditionally a post-GCSE blowout, with a simultaneous leg in Reading ‚Äì returns after its 2020 cancellation. Lateral flow tests and daily health checks are as much part of this year‚Äôs festival experience as bucket hats and glitter, but it‚Äôs otherwise rather eerily as if the pandemic never happened, with 75,000 attendees ‚Äì many of them teenagers joyously hugging ‚Äì and no masks or social distancing. The addition of a second main stage makes for a more continuous flow of music, although Wolf Alice‚Äôs triumphant, ethereally powerful teatime slot deserves a later billing.
With music in semi-limbo for 18 months and some high-profile US withdrawals, the scattergun bill combines zeitgeisty YouTubers and drill rappers in the tents with tried and trusted festival staples such as Catfish and the Bottlemen or Two Door Cinema Club on the outdoor stages. Friday headliners Biffy Clyro (late replacements for Queens of the Stone Age) first played in 2001, but the audience haven‚Äôt lost their enthusiasm for the topless, bearded, tattooed Scottish rockers and Many of Horror, about togetherness after a struggle, becomes a mass singalong.

One of the most satisfying sights in the kitchen is watching a circle of yeasted dough in very hot oil.

Then comes the blistering ‚Äì small bubbles erupting on its surface, before the big puff ‚Äì although this usually happens on just one side, which might save you the trouble of turning it over as the pizzetta capsizes, all the time getting more and more golden.

When Zoe split up with her boyfriend in 2012, she had ‚Äúa bit of an existential crisis‚Äù. Though she enjoyed her job as a support worker for a learning disability charity in York, she was keen to explore some of the thoughts she‚Äôd been having about life and its meaning, and to try something new. ‚ÄúI wanted to meet people and I‚Äôd always been really interested in social sciences,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo I decided to join an evening philosophy class to learn more.‚Äù In the second term, she spotted a man she hadn‚Äôt seen before in the coffee room. ‚ÄúThe class was mainly women and when I saw him I thought, oh, there‚Äôs a hottie in philosophy class!‚Äù
Tim had joined the class with his mother. ‚ÄúShe really wanted to go, but my dad wasn‚Äôt interested,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was basically her wingman. I remember being surrounded by women at the class. I was just there to give my mum a bit of confidence.‚Äù He thought Zoe was ‚Äúreally attractive‚Äù when they saw each other in the coffee room, but it took a while to build up the courage to talk to her.

                    <span>Nicolette Hahn Niman was an environmental lawyer who became a cattle rancher, and didn‚Äôt eat meat for 33 years. For both the ecosystem and human health, she argues, it‚Äôs how animals are farmed that matters
After refusing to eat meat for 33 years, Nicolette Hahn Niman bit tentatively into a beefburger two years ago. She had become a vegetarian because she was concerned about animal welfare and the environmental cost of meat. Unlike most vegetarians, she had experience of the dire conditions on factory farms during her career as an environmental lawyer campaigning against pollution caused by industrial meat production in the US. Then she married a farmer.
Hahn Niman‚Äôs journey from vegetarian activist to cattle rancher to writing a book called Defending Beef may be driven by love, but it is also informed by a lawyerly desire to stick up for small farmers besieged by the growing ethical and environmental clamour against meat. The burger turned out to be an unexpectedly delicious brief pleasure, but it was the 18 years working on the ranch alongside the man who grilled it ‚Äì and raised the cow ‚Äì her husband, Bill Niman, that inspired her.

I recently learned there is a Bake Off equivalent for sword making: Forged in Fire, an epic struggle between (almost exclusively) men and hot metal. Each episode climaxes with the show‚Äôs Paul Hollywood figure testing blades on a jelly torso filled with fake blood. If your sword wreaks graphic gelatinous carnage, you get the equivalent of a Hollywood handshake: the accolade ‚ÄúYour blade will keal‚Äù (which supposedly means it will ‚Äúkeep everyone alive‚Äù but that homophone is not accidental).

                    <span>Our dysfunctional labour market was reliant on a pool of exploitable workers
Empty shelves, missing product lines and the rising sense of a country that may not be able to feed itself: despite still being underplayed by most of the media, the results of Britain‚Äôs labour shortages are now ubiquitous.
Fruit growers warn that their crops are simply being left to rot. For want of regular workers, meat-processing plants are set to employ prisoners. The shortage of lorry drivers means that McDonald‚Äôs has run out of milkshakes. After 18 months of misery and disruption, most of us seem to be responding with fatalistic shrugs, although the situation also brings to mind a cliched but pointed question: can you imagine the reaction if this was happening under a Labour government?

                    <span>The modernist maestro had carte blanche to build a great museum. The result? A breathtaking icon hopeless for displaying art. British architect David Chipperfield relives his gargantuan repair job
Never has so much praise been lavished on so dysfunctional a building. The last major project of modernist master Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Berlin‚Äôs Neue Nationalgalerie is a perfectly square temple of steel and glass, raised above the street on its own granite acropolis. Built in 1968, not far from the recently erected Berlin Wall, it was intended to symbolise the freedoms of the west, its big black roof enclosing an epic column-free hall for the display of modern art. It has long been venerated as a 20th-century Parthenon, the ultimate example of Mies‚Äôs pursuit of ‚Äúuniversal space‚Äù.
But as a museum, it has always been a disaster. Ever since it opened, the New National Gallery has been dogged by cracking windows, heavy condensation and awkward display spaces, presenting a curatorial nightmare for its staff. Beneath the impractical grand hall are subterranean galleries for the permanent collection that have the dreary feeling of a windowless office complex. It is one of the most extreme examples of the quest for purity of form trumping the demands of function.

Litha Mar√≠a de Los Angeles slaps two cheese-filled pupusas ‚Äì the El Salvadoran cornmeal flatbread ‚Äì on the griddle. With a camera click on the QR code, she receives her payment: four hundred-thousandths of a Bitcoin. Then, as the rain pelts the corrugated iron roof and a gust of wind lifts the blue plastic table cloths, the power cuts out.
A tumultuous few weeks awaits El Salvador as it prepares to become the first country to adopt Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs most popular decentralised digital currency, as legal tender on 7 September. With that deadline looming, a host of challenges ‚Äì technological, financial and criminal ‚Äì threaten to sink the plan of the president, Nayib Bukele, to ride the Central American economy out of its current choppy waters on the back of a cryptocurrency wave.

For the last week we have been revisiting some of our favourite episodes from 2020. This one was first broadcast on 24 June.
On 28 May 2016 the photographer Jeff McCurry was taking pictures of a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla called Harambe in Cincinnati zoo when a child entered the enclosure. The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon as a result of McCurry‚Äôs picture and social media. Harambe‚Äôs image was everywhere. Despite his photo being shared billions of times, however, McCurry did not gain much financially. Since then advances in technology have given the world non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and McCurry has a way of finally cashing in on his famous image.

 2.00am BST 
Archery: Pretty rough for the two British archers to be drawn against each other in the 1/8 elimination final. Given it‚Äôs a competition with the focus on nations rather than individuals, that does seem like something that could be avoided. But do I know the complexities of archery seeding and draws? No.
Any rate. Phoebe Patterson Pine wins the first set with a couple of 10s, Jessica Stretton shooting 9-10-9 to cede it 28-29.

On the 15th day of Ghost Month, when the gates to hell are believed to open and spirits walk the earth, Taoist masters are invited to the Zhupu Altar, a massive temple built on a hillside in Keelung, northern Taiwan. The masters hold a ceremony to assist the spirits of those who died without family or friends to pray for them, known as ‚Äúhungry ghosts‚Äù but commonly referred to as good brothers and sisters to avoid offence.
Ghost Month is marked across east Asia, including Hong Kong, southern China, Indonesia and Malaysia. In Taiwan, Keelung is a significant site, with a history of violent disputes during the Qing dynasty, and it hosts the island‚Äôs biggest events. The ceremonies often draw tens of thousands of onlookers from afar, but these are Covid times.

People with a rare form of diabetes may receive better treatment and discover whether their children are also affected under new plans from NHS England.
Monogenic diabetes is caused by a single gene mutation ‚Äì although the specific gene affected can differ. The condition occurs in two types, neonatal ‚Äì which can occur within the first six months of life ‚Äì and maturity-onset diabetes of the young that develops later, often before the age of 25.

Read the first of our episode-by-episode recaps

A nuclear submarine. A dead body. A fishing trawler and her crew dragged beneath the waves by an unseen, unstoppable force. A reactor shutdown. Suranne Jones as a bereaved police detective battening down her grief to get on with the job. Martin Compston (DCI Arnott from Line of Duty) as ‚Äì well, we‚Äôll get to that. Paterson Joseph as a naval captain whose first duty is to his crew and his mission, not to a murder investigation. The BBC‚Äôs new six-part drama has all the ingredients to be an absolute humdinger of a series, and it is. Claustrophobics beware ‚Äì the submarine scenes are very, very submarine-y, all tiny bunks, narrow corridors and building pressure in all senses of the word ‚Äì but anyone who can bring themselves to watch will have hours of solid, old-fashioned entertainment delivered unto them.
We begin with the trawler crew, bantering away until something snags them and starts pulling them ‚Äì not quickly, quite harrowingly ‚Äì down into the vasty deep. A mile away and beneath, HMS Vigil hears their distress call. Petty Officer Burke (Compston) argues that they should go to the rescue. Captain Newsome (Joseph) insists they must not give away their position or place themselves at the mercy of whatever did for the boat, and Burke is sent to his bunk to calm down.

Under coronavirus rules in Scotland, double-vaccinated adults and all children have to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone with coronavirus unless they can provide a recent negative PCR test and are symptomless. Sturgeon had her second dose of a coronavirus vaccine in June.

                    <span>Actor and activist who starred as an irascible journalist in The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its spinoff drama series Lou Grant
It is very difficult to separate the character of the eponymous hero of the television series Lou Grant (1977-82) from the actor who played him. Ed Asner, who has died aged 91, will always be associated with the irascible but kindly crusading city editor of the Los Angeles Tribune, although he had a career that stretched back to the 1950s and continued long after Lou Grant was axed.
While the show was running, Asner was an outspoken activist against US support of the junta in El Salvador. He stood on the steps of the state department to announce the formation of Medical Aid for El Salvador and presented the first $25,000 relief cheque for war-ravaged communities there. Dozens of rightwing organisations asked their members to boycott the products that sponsored the show.

‚ÄúWe have been working like fingers on one hand, with different roles, and we came together as a big strong punch,‚Äù says the former captain and one of the founders of the Afghanistan women‚Äôs national football team, Khalida Popal. She is talking about the small team that pulled off the mission to evacuate 100-200 Afghan athletes and a number of individuals connected to them from the Hamid Karzai international airport in Kabul.
Across a two-week period those fingers worked tirelessly around the clock and across numerous time zones, tracking the real-time movements of the Taliban and military personnel on the ground to pull off what seemed completely impossible: to get a group of female football players, many teenagers, and a host of others, including family members, into the airport and on to planes.

Mohammed al-Naqib, the spokesman for Yemen‚Äôs southern forces, said the attack on Sunday on al-Anad airbase in the province of Lahj wounded at least 65. He said the casualty toll could rise since rescue teams were still clearing the site.

                    <span>Broad public support for environmental policies is crucial, writes Colin Hines of Green New Deal UK, while Michael Meadowcroft and Luce Gilmore believe a separate party undermines this
Andy Beckett is right to find some optimism in the record of the exceptional Green MP Caroline Lucas and the party‚Äôs growing number of councillors (The Greens are on the brink of power ‚Äì is it more than a political blip?, 27 August). However, the crucial route to power for green politics lies in cooperation with non-Tory parties to gain enough public support for effective environmental policies.
The government promises much, but there is a dearth of concrete policies. The chancellor hasn‚Äôt even announced his green bonds initiative that is supposed to appear this summer. Our research has shown that were savers to be adequately incentivised, this could provide billions to finance the ‚Äúgreen new deal‚Äù, if it was announced as a green recovery Isa, enabling usually older savers to fund green jobs.

                    <span>Geoffrey Bindman says that without collective action to defend the oppressed and the vulnerable, we are heading into dangerous isolationist territory
Simon Jenkins is right that ‚Äúmoral imperialism‚Äù has long been a motivating factor in military interventions by Britain and other western nations (The west‚Äôs nation-building fantasy is to blame for the mess in Afghanistan, 20 August). Afghanistan and Iraq are contemporary examples.
But concern about motive does not detract from the need to support and strengthen the international protection of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the framework of international humanitarian law which followed it were endorsed by almost every nation. The absence of an international police force ‚Äì a weakness in the structure ‚Äì increases the need for individual states to share responsibility for enforcement, particularly of international criminal law. The development of a ‚Äúresponsibility to protect‚Äù, dismissed by Jenkins, gives legitimacy to necessary humanitarian intervention. Military action should be a last resort, but it cannot be ruled out of every situation where lives are at stake.

The phrase ‚Äúnobody makes superhero movies like Australia‚Äù has, I dare say, never before been written. Our humble government-subsidised film and TV industry is no more than a lemonade stand in the shadow of Hollywood‚Äôs arena spectacular, unable to compete budget-wise with the deep pockets of Tinseltown or produce bombast on the scale of American studios.
But scratch the surface of Australian film and TV history and you will find a small but rich vein of super strange locally made superhero productions with their own ‚Äì forgive me ‚Äì true blue je ne sais quoi. Their eclecticism and off-kilter energy provides a refreshing counterpoint to the risk-averse kind falling off the Hollywood assembly line.

                    <span>Ministers will damage press freedom with proposals that would, if enacted, intimidate journalists into docility
In the modern state, it is obvious that some government information should remain secret. However, the power to conceal should not be open to abuse so that a government is protected from censure or humiliation, or able to suppress wrongdoing. Yet that is exactly where the state could end up if plans for a new system of secrecy without safeguards are enacted.
In its suggested reforms to the four Official Secrets Acts, the Home Office proposes an extremely hostile environment for journalism. The plans would make it easier to prosecute whistleblowers and more difficult to defend disclosing information that the government says is damaging to national security. Making journalists and sources liable in criminal law will surely deter them from revealing that the government has been up to something disastrous for British interests, or morally appalling, or both. Such plans ought to send a shudder down the spine of all those who care about the public‚Äôs right to know.

Leading a growing chorus of business organisations, the Institute of Directors (IoD) called for new, flexible visas that would allow foreign workers to step in to fill crucial roles, particularly as lorry drivers, after an exodus of workers due to Covid and Brexit.

                    <span>Rising levels of aggression directed at nurses and others can only worsen the crisis facing the health service
What a difference a year makes. This time last year, the country had not long ceased its weekly clap for carers. This ritual had its detractors (who thought it sentimental, or that extra pay would be preferable), but it focused attention, and gratefulness, on a cohort who were bearing the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The pandemic is not over, but earlier this month a survey found that more than a third of doctors have recently experienced verbal abuse and sometimes physical threats. In hospitals, it was most often nurses who were abused, while 96% of GPs had seen it happen to receptionists. Midwives report being physically threatened. Some NHS workers are beginning to hide their badges in public.

Half-points awarded after shortest F1 grand prix in history

The record books will record the Belgian Grand Prix as a race, and honours were duly awarded, but there was little dignity in how Formula One went about it on a rain-soaked afternoon at Spa-Francorchamps. It was the shortest race in the sport‚Äôs history, over in just three laps and eight minutes, all behind the safety car.
Max Verstappen was declared the winner for Red Bull, with George Russell second for Williams and Lewis Hamilton‚Äôs Mercedes in third. However, in what must count as a farcical determination by F1 to declare a result come what may, none of the drivers actually did any racing.

An estimated 8 million people in England with mental health problems cannot get specialist help because they are not considered sick enough to qualify, NHS leaders have revealed as the toll of the pandemic is laid bare.
The figure, drawn up by mental health trusts and NHS Providers, underlines the gap between the growing need for care for anxiety, depression and other mental health problems, and the ability of the NHS to treat them.

Footage of the recently separated former Vote Leave supremo throwing shapes at 1.15am at Bohemia nightclub circulated on the internet on Sunday. His hands flailed wildly, and occasionally swung in time to the music, in the clip filmed by a fellow clubber. Friends of Gove denied that he had attempted to avoid paying.

Here is a family animation from Peru that spins a magical tale in the Amazon with a cast of mythological creatures from rainforest legend ‚Äì and importantly, it‚Äôs told from the perspective of indigenous characters. It‚Äôs a shame, then, that so much here feels blandly generic, with frantic antics and quirky sidekick characters that kids have seen in a dozen movies before. Just as disappointingly, its plucky heroine Ainbo looks a bit plasticky: she‚Äôs a full-of-beans girl in the tradition of Moana ‚Äì strong-willed and brave of heart ‚Äì but she reminded me of an LOL Surprise! doll, with her adorable big eyes, cute crop-top and fashiony blunt fringe.
Still, there is a sense of adventure as Ainbo ‚Äì an apprentice hunter from a tribe deep in uncharted rainforest ‚Äì strikes out on her own to save the village. (You would too, it looks like a luxury spa resort from a Cond√© Nast Traveller feature.) The whole place has been cursed by an evil forest demon, the Yacuruna, a shapeshifting plume of black smoke with glowing red eyes (he might be too frightening for little ones).

Days later, it transpired that a new epilogue of a biography of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex states the pair believe the royal family did not take accountability for the concerns raised in their interview with Oprah Winfrey.

‚Ä¢ Obituary: one of Jamaica‚Äôs finest and most unpredictable musicians
Lee ‚ÄúScratch‚Äù Perry, whose pioneering work with roots reggae and dub opened up profound new depths in Jamaican music, has died aged 85.
Jamaican media reported the news that he died in hospital in Lucea, northern Jamaica. No cause of death has yet been given. Andrew Holness, the country‚Äôs prime minister, sent ‚Äúdeep condolences‚Äù to Perry‚Äôs family.

The day was supposed to be about their talismanic centre-forward. Instead it was his sidekick, Son Heung-min, on the day he became the first Asian player to reach 200 Premier League appearances, who secured the points with a free-kick shortly before the break. He is so much more than an understudy.

In florist Keith Dawson‚Äôs garden, the predominant colour is green. Hedges of hornbeam line the long alleyways, creating intimate paths that open into a wide lawn with a hawthorn tree at its centre, the focal point of the scheme. Ivy creeps over the floor and cloaks tree trunks, while feathery white goat‚Äôs beard, Aruncus, and statuesque angelica fill the beds.
The same sensibility registers inside the house, where the decor is a perfect reflection of its inhabitants‚Äô personalities. An ultra-cool atmosphere reigns in the order of rooms. There‚Äôs no sign of country kitsch, and the renovations are meticulous. Every switch or window sash has been considered.

A charity founded by the Prince of Wales has launched an ethics investigation into ‚Äúcash for access‚Äù claims that middlemen took cuts for setting up dinners involving wealthy donors and the heir to the throne.
The Prince‚Äôs Foundation said it was taking the allegations ‚Äúvery seriously‚Äù after it was claimed that individuals could pay ¬£100,000 to secure a dinner with the charity‚Äôs founder and an overnight stay at Dumfries House, his mansion in Scotland. An email was said to reveal that fixers could take up to 25% of the fees, which were intended for the royal‚Äôs charity ventures, the Mail on Sunday reported.

                    <span>Poorer countries need to be able to produce their own vaccines. Until that happens, they will be left behind
The Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 is causing major problems across the world. Estimated to be at least twice as transmissible as the original virus, it is challenging the measures that governments took in 2020. Thailand and South Korea are seeing accelerating cases and deaths, after having successfully managed their epidemics last year. New Zealand and Australia find themselves in snap lockdowns. Low- and middle-income countries are struggling to keep their hospitals from collapsing. Delta has changed the game radically: it is almost like managing a whole new virus.
Though, while much of the world struggles, life seems almost normal in Britain. London nightclubs are full of those partying and enjoying themselves without a care in the world. Festivals are going ahead with tens of thousands of revellers. After incessant daily media coverage, Covid-19 has fallen off the front pages, receding into the background. Observing this, it feels as if the pandemic is over for most people.

UK rap‚Äôs go-to collaborator makes a strong case for his music not to be pigeonholed with this radio-friendly debut album 
It‚Äôs been a frustrating few years for east London singer-rapper Not3s. Since 2017‚Äôs viral hit Addison Lee, he has coped with the record industry‚Äôs sluggish release schedules by becoming UK rap‚Äôs go-to collaborator for the likes of Mabel, Headie One and Tinie. He has also questioned why his blend of Afrobeat, trap and R&amp;B can‚Äôt just be labelled pop as opposed to being awkwardly pigeonholed as Afroswing.
As if to prove his point, the first half of this debut proper (there have been mixtapes) prioritises radio-friendly bangers. The bouncy, AJ Tracey-accentuated One More Time playfully riffs on Britney‚Äôs biggest hit, while hook-laden summer sizzler Boom Bam is basically one long chorus. Even when things get introspective on the spiritual 3rd Eye, it‚Äôs anchored by a billowy, Radio 2-ready chorus.

Afghanistan ‚Äì live updates

As word of Kabul‚Äôs fall to the Taliban spread across Afghanistan, there were few who greeted the news with as much fear as the Hazara Shias. The religious minority in this Sunni majority country were among the most persecuted groups when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, and the memories of the killings, torture and mass executions have not faded.
Signs point to Hazaras once again finding themselves a target of the Taliban. A recent Amnesty report found that Taliban militants were responsible for the murder of nine Hazaras in July, in the village of Mundarakht. Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off.

After the second world war, Greece‚Äôs countryside experienced two debilitating human surges ‚Äì an exodus of villagers, then a most peculiar human invasion of its fringes. These two surges, aided by a weak state and abetted by the climate crisis, have turned the low-level drama of naturally redemptive forest fires into this summer‚Äôs heart-wrenching catastrophe.
After heatwaves of unprecedented longevity, wildfires across the summer months have so far destroyed more than 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of ancient pine forests. They have blackened swathes of Attica, scorched parts of ancient Olympia and obliterated north Evia‚Äôs magnificent forests ‚Äì whose rural communities lost their homes, not to mention their livelihoods and landscapes.

When Stuart Fenwick first moved to London seven years ago, he spent a lot of time on foot exploring the capital‚Äôs towpaths. His wanderings prompted a recurring dream in which he ran a floristry studio aboard a narrowboat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working with flowers since I was 15 and I‚Äôve always wanted a shop, but could never really afford it,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúThe overheads in London are just too high and unfortunately, retail floristry has been in decline for a long time.‚Äù Fenwick found the solution in Bria ‚Äì a 42ft narrowboat that roves the city‚Äôs waterways.

In the stormy waters of the North Sea, 15 miles off the coast of Aberdeenshire, in Scotland, five floating offshore wind turbines stretch 574 feet (175 metres) above the water. The world‚Äôs first floating windfarm, a 30 megawatt facility run by the Norwegian company Equinor, has only been in operation since 2017 but has already broken UK records for energy output.
While most offshore wind turbines are anchored to the ocean floor on fixed foundations, limiting them to depths of about 165ft, floating turbines are tethered to the seabed by mooring lines. These enormous structures are assembled on land and pulled out to sea by boats.

‚Ä¢ Afghanistan ‚Äì live updates
France and Britain plan to table an emergency UN security council resolution on Monday calling for the Taliban to back a civilian-run safe zone at Kabul airport that would allow the continued air evacuation of those who want to leave the country, the French president has said.
‚ÄúWhat we are trying to do is to be able to organise targeted humanitarian operations for evacuations that will not take place through the military airport in Kabul,‚Äù Emmanuel Macron told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.

Stuart Robinson and Jim Roberts combine for 38 points in win

If this felt like a big, impactful moment then it was surely appropriate. Wheelchair rugby, the sport of smashing and grabbing and sprinting and crashing, is a definitive Paralympic event. It‚Äôs a sport of danger and cunning and of absolute granite determination. For the first time, Great Britain are the champions.
Led by Stuart Robinson, the former RAF gunner who lost both his legs to an IED in Afghanistan, and Jim Roberts, who turned to wheelchair rugby during the three years he spent in hospital recovering from bacterial meningitis, Great Britain beat the United States ‚Äì the most successful nation in the history of the sport ‚Äì by 54 tries to 49 and led from start to finish.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) welcomed the offers received so far to help Afghans who risked their lives working alongside British armed forces and diplomats in Afghanistan and asked others to follow suit.

Gen Lord Richard Dannatt‚Äôs comments followed the final flight containing UK troops and diplomatic staff from Kabul, bringing to an end Britain‚Äôs 20-year engagement in Afghanistan. The UK‚Äôs ambassador to the country, Sir Laurie Bristow, was among those who arrived on Sunday morning at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

The 32 refugees ‚Äì women, men, and a child of 15 years old ‚Äì have been stuck in a small, muddy patch of land between the two countries for almost three weeks with no access to clean water, insufficient shelter and intermittent food supplies, according to a Polish NGO.

Mark Cousins and Nigella Lawson seem, at first, an unlikely pairing. He is an author and film-maker from Northern Ireland, based in Edinburgh, who makes enraptured documentaries about the wonders of cinema. She is one of the most recognisable faces in the food world, a cookery writer and broadcaster who, with each new offering, seals her status as a national treasure.
Looking closer, their friendship ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a relatively recent one, conducted mainly via Twitter ‚Äì begins to make sense. Cousins approaches everything he sees with unbridled enthusiasm and a sense of almost childlike awe, to which Lawson clearly responds. She shares his love of the movies, particularly Italian cinema, while he is evidently a great fan of her TV work, declaring it ‚Äúmore noticeably aesthetic, more into imagery and feel, than many‚Äù food shows. And they are both fascinated by visual allure ‚Äì its pleasures and many pitfalls.

Let‚Äôs start with the good news: we‚Äôre getting brighter. Sadly, not individually as we age, but IQs have risen over time, with new generations having higher reasoning skill scores than their predecessors. This progress on abstract reasoning is in contrast to plateauing or declining scores for retained knowledge such as vocabulary.
Better nutrition or healthcare might explain some of this improvement. But there‚Äôs also been a greater focus on skills over knowledge by schools and parents. This was what Michael Gove was pushing against with his focus on children needing to learn basic facts.

At the bottom of the garden, past the old well and the hazel frames of runner beans, was what we grandly called ‚Äúthe orchard‚Äù. Hidden among the pear and greengage trees, past the vast Bramley apple and two damsons was an ancient plum tree. It was my favourite tree in the garden, probably my favourite tree ever ‚Äì its trunk almost bent double, too brittle to climb without snapping a branch and breaking a bone, its bark mottled with sage green lichen.
Each spring there was a mass of blossom and the petals would swirl up in a snowstorm when the wind blew. In late summer the fruit ‚Äì golden, translucent, a haven for wasps ‚Äì hung in clusters. I guess it was inevitable that one day, when I had my own garden, I would plant my own.

                    <span>Thanks to the arrival of Nigel Farage at GB News, the veteran newsman now finds himself among the mops and Domestos
A woman I went on a blind date with in 1988 told me that witches she knew would consort with the devil at midnight, on the meadow by the river outside the town where I was a student. Soon after I decided to become a standup comedian, I sought them out, in the shadow of a ruined abbey, where the cursed remains of Henry II‚Äôs mistress Rosamund were destroyed in the dissolution. A bearded middle-aged man in a black polo neck and a pentangle pendant, a cliched look he nonetheless owned convincingly, stated terms on which I could be guaranteed to succeed beyond my wildest dreams. And, like a bloody fool, I accepted them. As promised, in 2018 the Times newspaper declared me the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs greatest living standup‚Äù. But I know the cost of that accolade. Deals with the devil have a habit of turning sour.
In 1930, at the age of 19, the travelling troubadour Robert Johnson stood at midnight, lit by the moon, at the crossroads of Highways 49 and 61, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and sold his soul to Papa Legba in exchange for unprecedented blues power. On 13 June 2021, at the age of 94 and a half, the respected veteran newsman Andrew Neil stood in a studio in Paddington Basin, lit by some battery-operated torches bought from an all-night garage in the Harrow Road, and sold his soul, and his reputation, to GB News chief executive Roberto Rastapopoulos‚Ñ¢¬Æ. What did Andrew Neil want in exchange for his precious essence? Money? Power? Some hair? And what did Andrew Neil get? Public humiliation, the loss of his hard-won reputation, the chance to play second fiddle to Nigel Farage and a tasty feast of hard cheddar, humble pie and human excrement. And no hair.

                    <span>Trillions of metallic nodules on the sea floor could help stop global heating, but mining them may damage ocean ecology
In a display cabinet in the recently opened Our Broken Planet exhibition in London‚Äôs Natural History Museum, curators have placed a small nugget of dark material covered with faint indentations. The blackened lump could easily be mistaken for coal. Its true nature is much more intriguing, however.
The nugget is a polymetallic nodule and oceanographers have discovered trillions of them litter Earth‚Äôs ocean floors. Each is rich in manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper, some of the most important ingredients for making the electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels that we need to replace the carbon-emitting lorries, power plants and factories now wrecking our climate.

In his memoir of having Covid-19, the poet Michael Rosen recalled doctors telling him he had a 50‚Äì50 chance of surviving mechanical ventilation.
This advice was optimistic: of ventilated over-70s in the first two waves, almost 70% died. That statistic, and other sobering numbers, is in weekly reports from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) covering around 40,000 critically ill patients with Covid-19. These reports reveal major changes between the first wave up to August 2020 and the far fewer patients in the current wave since May 2021.

                    <span>A forensic psychiatrist recalls her attempts to connect with some of society‚Äôs most damaged and dangerous people
During my first week as a newly qualified forensic psychiatrist at Broadmoor, I had to visit one of the wards. At the foot of a staircase, I stepped aside to let a group of patients pass. Another staff member joined me, and we waited as the men, mainly in their 40s and 50s, descended in silence, walking carefully, hands skimming or leaning on the bannister for support. One man caught my attention because he looked like a stock image of Father Christmas, with a big white beard. When they‚Äôd gone, my companion turned to me. ‚ÄúDo you know who that was?‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúPeter Sutcliffe‚Ä¶ you know, the Yorkshire Ripper.‚Äù
I remember thinking, with an intake of breath, ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs him.‚Äù He was one of the hospital‚Äôs most notorious patients, that rarest of offenders, a serial killer. I felt shaken for a moment, and then it dawned on me that the shock was that there was nothing to see. He was just a man, not a monster. When detectives in Yorkshire were desperately trying to solve a series of brutal murders of local women, they interviewed Mr Sutcliffe seven times before he was identified as the suspect. They evidently saw nothing to mark him out from any other man.

I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones drummer who died on Tuesday, interviewing him in 2000 for one of his beloved jazz projects. In the interview, I managed to call George Harrison ‚Äúthe bass player of the Beatles‚Äù. Still, I got some things right, writing: ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äôs the Stone who is so universally well liked that he commands instant respect without trying.‚Äù
It soon became apparent when his death was announced that the response was about honouring a great musician ‚Äì the rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll legend, the lifelong jazz aficionado ‚Äì but also a lot more. There was the standard emotional outpouring, the shock and dismay, that sense of grief-ownership that hits you: ‚ÄúOh no, not Charlie!‚Äù However irrational such feelings are (Watts was 80, not 20), it nevertheless stings when one of ‚Äúyour own‚Äù artists takes their final bow. But something else was noteworthy: the reaction, immense and heartfelt, was also courteous, genuine, adult.

In September 1981, 32 women, four men and several children marched from Cardiff to Berkshire to protest over nuclear weapons being sited at RAF Greenham Common. The following year, the founders declared the camp ‚Äúwomen only‚Äù, and the Greenham Common Women‚Äôs Peace Camp became one of the longest and most famous examples of feminist protest in recent history.
The camp was set up outside the RAF base to protest against US nuclear weapons on British common land. Facing police and soldiers, the women sang: ‚ÄúAre you on the side of suicide, are you on the side of homicide, are you on the side of genocide, which side are you on?‚Äù

Rather than staying in a busy campsite, or trying to get a rare available holiday home, Thomas, her partner Pete Matthews and labradoodle Betty checked into a 13th-century church. ‚ÄúIt was the appeal of doing something a little bit different‚Ä¶ I hate being disturbed by other people‚Äôs noise.

                    <span>Listening to Joe Biden‚Äôs words as the US left Afghanistan was to hear echoes of George W Bush from 2001. Is this a crisis destined to repeat itself?
Many who heard President Biden‚Äôs pledge to exact revenge for the killing of 13 US Marines in an Islamic State suicide bombing in Kabul last week will have been struck by how closely they resembled the words of George W Bush almost exactly 20 years ago.
‚ÄúI want justice,‚Äù Bush then told a nation traumatised by 3,000 deaths in the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs an old poster out west that says, ‚ÄòWanted: Dead or Alive‚Äô.‚Äù Bush is no longer president and Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks whose face was on the putative poster, died in a US special forces raid 10 years ago. But the rhetoric remains the same. ‚ÄúWe will hunt you down and make you pay,‚Äù Biden said on Thursday. Such language is unavoidable for the leader of a nation that retains and promotes a ‚Äúfrontier culture‚Äù, as a veteran CIA official told me last week, but it signals much more too.

Enda Burke spent lockdown with his parents in Galway City on the west coast of Ireland. As a street photographer, with street life on hold, he decided to focus on the people closest to hand. The result is an award-winning series, Homebound With My Parents, which turns lockdown into theatre. His luminously exuberant colourscape ‚Äì candyfloss pink, sunflower yellow and turquoise ‚Äì offers ‚Äúan antidote to the gloom of Covid‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bid for ‚Äúvibrancy, humour, a form of escapism‚Äù. To pull this bright new world off, Burke turned the family home upside down and meticulously constructed each set himself. He ordered his retro items online, put up wallpaper and drilled his parents into their new lockdown roles.
When I cross-question him about how they reacted to this hijacking, the 33-year-old reports that his parents are ‚Äúvery easygoing‚Äù, and says they had many laughs together. ‚ÄúI said to them, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre being actors ‚Äì this is acting and people really love that.‚Äô‚Äù In an introduction to his series, he reveals a fascination with the ‚Äúmonotony associated with family life during the pandemic‚Äù, but life in Galway City during the creation of these photographs seems to have been anything but monotonous.

The New Black Vanguard features the work of Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover, and Dana Scruggs, who achieved the same extraordinarily overdue milestone at Rolling Stone, when she photographed the rapper Travis Scott in 2019.
Scruggs, born in Chicago and based in New York, started out photographing vintage clothes and furniture for her own Etsy store a decade ago. In 2016, frustrated by the continuing lack of diversity in advertising and fashion, she crowdfunded the launch of her own magazine, SCRUGGS, to showcase her distinctive ways of expressing light and movement, focusing on the black male body. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fearfulness of black men in American society and globally,‚Äù Scruggs said. ‚ÄúI wanted to change the narrative.‚Äù

The app is meant to be the best way to unlock the offering at this food hall with its many outlets and gracious table service. Now it has taken me all the way through the process before telling me I am 78 miles away from my order. This is a profound tragedy, albeit only within the narrow parameters set by a restaurant critic‚Äôs nightmarish entitlement.

Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro says he sees three options for his future: winning the 2022 presidential election, death or prison.
‚ÄúI have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed or victory,‚Äù he said on Saturday, in remarks to a meeting of evangelical leaders. Bolsonaro later added that the first option is out of question. ‚ÄúNo man on Earth will threaten me.‚Äù

The UK‚Äôs North Sea oil industry may have survived one of the darkest market downturns in history during the Covid-19 pandemic, but the deepest gloom lies over the future of the fossil-fuel industry.
Companies are braced for this week‚Äôs annual economic report from industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK). It is expected to lay bare the full toll of the pandemic on the ageing oil and gas basin last year.

Thousands of emails to the Foreign Office from MPs and charities detailing urgent cases of Afghans trying to escape from Kabul have not been read, including cases flagged by government ministers, the Observer has been told.
The UK‚Äôs Afghanistan evacuation concluded on Saturday night with the departure of Britain‚Äôs final military and diplomatic personnel, bringing a sudden end to the 20-year deployment. More than 15,000 people have been brought out of the country in the last fortnight, in what ministers described as the largest UK military evacuation since the second world war.

Thomas Tuchel admitted he was disappointed with the referee Anthony Taylor‚Äôs decision to show Reece James a red card and award a penalty to Liverpool after seeing Chelsea‚Äôs 100% start to the season ended at Anfield.
Tuchel‚Äôs side had seemed on course to earn a third successive victory to start the new season after Kai Havertz‚Äôs brilliant header had given them the lead in the first half. But having come close to extending their lead, James was dismissed after appearing to partially block Sadio Man√©‚Äôs shot on the stroke of half-time, with Mohamed Salah scoring the penalty to earn Liverpool a 1-1 draw.

                    <span>Collagen supplements are booming, but there is mixed advice on whether eating the protein offers anything more than a healthy, balanced diet
To fulfil our culture‚Äôs relentless drive for wrinkle-free skin and an eternal youthful glow, collagen supplements have been gaining more attention, fuelling a booming industry. How well do they work? The short answer: there is evidence that eating collagen may be effective, but experts say we can get what we need through a healthy diet.
There‚Äôs no doubt this protein ‚Äì the most abundant in the body ‚Äì is important. Collagen is derived from the Greek word k√≥lla, meaning glue, and makes up around three quarters of the skin. More than skin-deep, collagen provides structure for bodily organs, blood vessels, teeth, bones, cartilage, tendons and ligaments (its properties have even been exploited for an assorted array of innovations including glue, musical instrument strings, fabrics and rope baskets).

Andy Murray hopes that more players choose to be vaccinated over the coming months as tennis faces a possible reckoning over its rate of inoculation among tour professionals, which is widely believed to be below 50%.
Murray, who faces Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round of the US Open on Monday, was speaking in the wake of the USTA announcing on Friday that all fans must have received at least one dose in order to enter the grounds. As such, the only unvaccinated people in the stadiums will be many of the players on court.

Coronavirus infections in England are now 26 times the levels that were experienced this time last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Scientists described the figures as ‚Äúsobering‚Äù.
They warned that the reopening of schools in England this week was likely to trigger further rises in Covid cases ‚Äì with more to follow when students return to universities and colleges. A fresh wave of infections could, in turn, lead to new social restrictions being imposed as winter approaches.

The new leader of one of Britain‚Äôs biggest unions has vowed to take on Amazon by plotting an international campaign to unionise its warehouses and improve conditions for its workers.
In an interview with the Observer, Sharon Graham, who became Unite‚Äôs general secretary last week after a shock victory, said she was in talks with unions in Germany and the US ‚Äì Amazon‚Äôs other major markets ‚Äì to effectively form a global union campaign that would ‚Äúpincer‚Äù Amazon and force it to allow workers to organise themselves more freely.

When the email arrived last Tuesday, Faaiz Ghulam and his young family were euphoric. Approved for evacuation, they were instructed to head straight to the west gate of Kabul‚Äôs Baron Hotel. There, British officials would process their case. Next step, the UK.
Yet Ghulam, his wife and their two children ‚Äì an 18-month-old daughter and three-year-old son ‚Äì are today in hiding in Kabul, terrified for their lives. Their first attempt to reach the hotel ended at a Taliban checkpoint. A second was abandoned over safety concerns as Ghulam and his wife carried their children through febrile crowds outside the airport.

The Queen will be dead soon and with her will pass the last significant remnant of British feudalism. The future belongs to her grandson and his wife, who have judged the modern world with calculating eyes and placed the ultra-capitalist entertainment industry above old royal privilege.
They cannot stop emoting. If they did, it‚Äôs not just that they would lose money as surely as a supermarket chain would lose if it closed its stores for a summer holiday. They would lose relevance. And as status is so intertwined with the business of making money in celebrity culture that you cannot separate the two, the loss would cut deeper.

What is the best way to deal with critical customer feedback? Well, Joan, a veteran academic at the fictional Pembroke College, an almost-Ivy League American university, knows exactly what to do with it. She quietly puts a match to reams of negative student evaluations of her work.
It is an amusing, angry scene that takes place inside her grim, cellar-like university study and occurs somewhere towards the middle of new six-part television drama The Chair. But it is also a moment that sits right at the show‚Äôs emotional core. Joan is clearly doing wrong, but her diminished status as an ageing, overlooked lecturer makes her a sympathetic figure.

                    <span>One was abducted and never fancied football afterwards, while the latest waxes eloquently about bitcoin and Elon Musk
I used to go to a barber who believed he had once been abducted by aliens. Regular in-the-mirror conversation starters ‚Äì ‚Äúbeen away this year?‚Äù, ‚Äúdid you see the match last night?‚Äù ‚Äì would generally return to that formative moment when the ‚Äúgrey figures‚Äù appeared at the foot of his bed.
‚ÄúTo be honest, I‚Äôve found flying quite tough since the abduction,‚Äù he would say over my shoulder, with hangdog matter of factness. Or, breaking off from his clipping: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange but I‚Äôve not been so into football since I was ‚Äòtaken up‚Äô.‚Äù

                    <span>Stones post montage of clips from drummer‚Äôs almost 60-year career with band
He thought it would last a year at most, but Charlie Watts‚Äôs run as drummer with the Rolling Stones lasted nearly six decades. This weekend surviving band members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood united to bid a public farewell to the man whose rhythms powered their many hits, who died last Tuesday aged 80.
After commenting individually on the loss last week, the Stones have released a video tribute featuring key moments of Watts‚Äôs career. The two-minute clip, posted on social media, includes an interview in which the drummer, a lorry driver‚Äôs son from Wembley, revealed that when he joined the band in 1963, he thought it might last a year.

                    <span>Artist William Mullan‚Äôs obsession with apples began in Waitrose in Esher, Surrey. An American kid who moved a lot with his dad‚Äôs job, Mullan‚Äôs eye was first caught by the Egremont Russet. ‚ÄúIt was the ugliest apple I had ever seen. It looked like a gold-sprayed potato. I had to have it. When I ate one, I was overwhelmed, with layers of flavour conjuring the warm cider I drank in the midwest, the roast chestnut stands in London, and the feeling of rolling in rust-coloured leaves on a crisp autumn day.‚Äù 
Mullan is now a Brooklyn-based brand director for a chocolate-maker, but he still finds time for fruit. His Technicolor, sensuous photographic series Odd Apples is now available as an art book (Hatje Cantz Verlag, ¬£18).

                    <span>Power from fusion has proved too hard to generate at scale. Can recent breakthroughs and massive investment change that?
On 8 August 2021, a laser-initiated experiment at the United States National Ignition Facility (NIF), based at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, made a significant breakthrough in reproducing the power source of the stars, smashing its own 2018 record for energy released from nuclear fusion reactions 23 times over. This advance saw 70% of the laser energy put in released as nuclear energy. A pulse of light, focused to tiny spots within a 10-metre diameter vacuum chamber, triggered the collapse of a capsule of fuel from roughly the size of the pupil in your eye to the diameter of a human hair. This implosion created the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure needed for atoms of hydrogen to combine into new atoms and release, kilogram for kilogram, 10m times the energy that would result from burning coal.
The result is tantalisingly close to a demonstration of ‚Äúnet energy gain‚Äù, the long sought-after goal of fusion scientists in which an amount greater than 100% of the energy put into a fusion experiment comes out as nuclear energy. The aim of these experiments is ‚Äì for now ‚Äì to show proof of principle only: that energy can be generated. The team behind the success are very close to achieving this: they have managed a more than 1,000-fold improvement in energy release between 2011 and today. Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said last month that ‚ÄúThe pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kickstart the process.‚Äù

Boris Johnson must wish he owned a time machine to transport him beyond what is shaping up to be one of the most difficult autumns faced by any prime minister. Events in October and November are about to set the tone for the rest of the parliament and the premiership of our once brazen, and now rather bedraggled, PM.
The list of promises that will transform the UK into a 21st-century economic powerhouse are long and costly, and most of them are tied closely to Johnson‚Äôs personal ambitions. He has told us that his government will transform the education system, the skills base and the social care system, and ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù the regions. Backlogs of NHS operations will be cleared and the path to net zero carbon emissions charted.

The Taliban has deployed extra forces and almost sealed off Kabul airport following the carnage that erupted after a suicide bomber detonated explosives into the crowd, killing 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US soldiers.
On Saturday, Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul remained under a high security alert, with the US telling any citizens still queuing at the gates to leave immediately. The Taliban also began efforts to tightly secure the whole area around the airport. Extra Taliban forces, many armed with US military equipment, were deployed to set up new layers of checkpoints and blocked all routes to the gates, bringing some order to a previous place of terror and chaos.

                    <span>As the high school comedy returns for a third series, its Bafta-winning star talks about stage fright, embarrassing scenes, and the torment that lay behind her desire to please people
In June, Aimee Lou Wood, 26, won a Bafta for best female performance in a comedy programme for her role as another Aimee (a teenager) in the hit Netflix show Sex Education, about a set of sexually active high school students, now returning for a third series. Even before the Bafta, Wood was always being stopped in the street. Fans wanted to talk to her, about Sex Education, about everything, because they related to her so strongly. Wood is naturally so friendly, she‚Äôd engage in conversation and make herself late. Then she starred opposite Bill Nighy in the forthcoming Oliver Hermanus film, Living: ‚ÄúObviously, every single person recognises Bill Nighy, and he handles it with such grace,‚Äù Wood says, when we meet to talk in a north London photo studio. ‚ÄúWith people in the street, I was like [she mock hyperventilates]: ‚ÄòDid I say the right thing? Was I nice enough?‚Äô Now I‚Äôm learning to be: ‚ÄòThank you so much!‚Äô and carry on walking.‚Äù
It‚Äôs easy to see why fans relate to Wood: never mind the dazzling prettiness, she‚Äôs sparky, warm and expressive. She comes from a working-class family in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and although, following her parents‚Äô divorce, her mother‚Äôs new partner paid for her to attend a private secondary school, she kept her rich Mancunian tones: ‚ÄúI sound like my mum and I like that.

It has been called a ‚ÄúBTec Eiffel Tower‚Äù and a ‚Äúslag heap‚Äù. It‚Äôs been compared to ‚Äúa car-park Santa‚Äôs grotto, with dogs pretending to be reindeer‚Äù. The Marble Arch Mound, the temporary artificial hill commissioned by Westminster city council as an ‚Äúambitious‚Äù visitor attraction, has become, as a representative of the local community put it, ‚Äúan international laughing stock‚Äù.
The council responded to criticism by allowing free entry during August, and a certain number of the curious and the ghoulishly fascinated have turned up. This week it will start charging again. Given fundamental flaws in the project‚Äôs conception, the question is whether people will want to pay ¬£8 for a weekend fast-track ticket now, any more than they did when it first opened at the end of July.

Director Nia DaCosta‚Äôs smart, stylish ‚Äúspiritual sequel‚Äù, co-written and produced by Jordan Peele, reimagines its protagonist as a Black artist. In this version, Anthony (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) mines creative inspiration from the tale of a killer ghost who appears when his name is uttered five times in the mirror.
DaCosta‚Äôs visual flair is apparent, from the way she details flesh turning to rotten honeycomb, to the visceral squelch of pressing open a wound. Candyman‚Äôs attacks are inventively mounted too, playing out in the reflections of floor-to-ceiling windows and a teenage girl‚Äôs compact mirror. Anthony says his paintings ‚Äúfocus on the body‚Äù, a self-conscious allusion to the way the director leans into body horror too.

Teachers across England have complained of leaking ceilings, broken heating systems and ventilation too poor to deal with the threat of Covid, as the overwhelming majority of headteachers warned that they do not have the funds to repair their dilapidated school buildings.
The Observer has been contacted by teachers who say they have had to empty water out of their keyboards in the morning, move tables and chairs each day to avoid puddles and ask children to wear coats inside in winter as a result of unsuitable buildings in dire need of repair.

Occasionally, it happens with a Jed Mercurio drama, sometimes with an ill-advised interview inexplicably offered up by a member of the royal family, but television‚Äôs ability to conjure up a must-see moment has been waning for years, fragmented into endless options by on-demand and smartphones.
Yet in my family, Gogglebox is essential viewing. When it‚Äôs in season, there is almost always a post-match discussion, a dissection of the highlights, who was funny, what they loved and that debate about whether the celebrity version is a meagre substitute for watching normal people having a chat and a laugh about what‚Äôs happened in the world that week.

                    <span>I never meant to become a restaurant reviewer for life. But I found everything I needed is there in what we eat
My father was not a big eater. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy if I could just take a pill for my lunch,‚Äù he once told me, when I was eight or nine years old. I had already concluded that the adult world could be wilfully baffling, but this seemed unnecessarily provocative. It felt like a betrayal. As a child, an unfocused mess of fat-softened limbs and round edges, I knew that food was great. I loved bacon sandwiches on white bread and chocolate √©clairs, and lived for evenings when my parents were short on time and dinner was the convenience of Findus Crispy Pancakes filled with delicious, if unidentifiable, brown matter.
Happily, my mother was not interested in getting her nutrition from a pill. Claire wanted both to feed and be fed. On Saturday lunchtimes, after they had done the weekly shop, my mother would fill the kitchen table with cold cuts and cheeses, and plates laid with slippery ribbons of smoked salmon in the brightest shade of orange. There would be dense fish balls, chopped liver topped with crumbled egg and bagels, for we were Jews through food. There was no space in our lives for God, but there was lots of space for lunch. It was a meal called ‚ÄúFick and Porridge‚Äù, an adapted Spoonerism of pick and forage. It was one of those family jokes which isn‚Äôt funny to anybody else or even, eventually, to the family who coined it, but which sticks. What mattered was the intent expressed in the name: this was a knowingly relaxed lunch. It was also a form of open house to which certain close family friends knew they were always invited. And so they would come.

The Glaswegian trio use horror film tropes to explore fame, double standards and battles closer to home on their intense fourth album
In 1992, the US film professor Carol J Clover published Men, Women and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film (Princeton University Press). In it, she introduced the concept of the ‚Äúfinal girl‚Äù, a female protagonist who survives the bloodbath to take on the slasher in the closing scenes. If the final girl is heroic, she is also a problematic figure, kept alive by the film-maker because of her sobriety or chastity while other women who have more fun get the axe. The sequel makes the final girl‚Äôs victory pyrrhic anyway.
Midway through Screen Violence, Chvrches‚Äô intense fourth album, a song called Final Girl puts the well-worn horror trope to a more personal use. Lauren Mayberry ‚Äì mouthpiece of the Glaswegian synth-pop trio ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúend up in a bodybag‚Äù. In 2019, Chvrches co-authored a huge tune, Here With Me, with Marshmello. The EDM DJ then went on to work with Chris Brown, the rapper convicted of violently assaulting Rihanna.

Six ways to improve your train journey to work

As September approaches, employers are increasingly asking workers to come in, with many offices adopting hybrid systems after months of working from home ‚Äì prompting mixed emotions. Commuting can be both expensive and polluting. UK workers pay more of their salary in commuting costs than their EU counterparts and, before the pandemic, two-thirds of people travelled to work by car. But despite the costs, which also include time, some value the commute for separating their home and work lives.

How and when did human language evolve? Did a ‚Äúgrammar module‚Äù just pop into our ancestors‚Äô brains one day thanks to a random change in our DNA? Or did language come from grooming, or tool use, or cooking meat with fire? These and other hypotheses exist, but there seems little way to rationally choose between them.

Or must it? This is the question presented as an elegant intellectual thriller by The Dawn of Language: Axes, Lies, Midwifery and How We Came to Talk. Its author is Sverker Johansson, a serene and amiable 60-year-old Swede who speaks to me over Zoom from his book-crammed home study in the city of Falun, where he works as a senior adviser at Dalarna University.

If you listen, I mean really listen, you will hear your garden speaking to you. Mine, which sits on a 10th-floor Manhattan terrace, a stone‚Äôs throw from where the World Trade Center stood, first spoke to me on a crisp September morning 20 years ago. I had jury duty that day and decided to walk the two miles south from my home in Greenwich Village down to the courthouse in the financial district.
But when I turned south on to 6th Avenue, I looked up to see see an orange hole flaming at the centre of the tower ahead of me. A woman nearby fell to the pavement, screaming something about a plane. It didn‚Äôt seem like a good day to go downtown; yet something compelled me to continue south. When I arrived at a gas station on Canal Street, a boom sounded and a puff of smoke issued from just behind the tower. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked a taxi driver, filling his tank nearby. ‚ÄúWell, see those two buildings are connected with pipes,‚Äù he said with the unquestionable authority endemic to New York cabbies. ‚ÄúWhen you get a fire in one it spreads and you get a fire in the other.‚Äù Makes sense, I thought, and pushed southwards.

It‚Äôs that back-to-school/back-to-work weekend, when the gears suddenly shift, especially for those who are returning to the office for the first time in ages. It can all be a bit of a bump, this great return, but it‚Äôs one that can be softened by some tasty work lunches: things that can be made the night before, or moreish snacks that keep well for days, ready to be nibbled on. The desk might be clean-slate clear, but there‚Äôs no harm in a few flakes of pastry or crumbs from some brittle to help ease the transition.

Earlier on Friday, US President Joe Biden‚Äôs national security team told the president that another terror attack is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù in Kabul, and that ‚Äúmaximum force protection‚Äù measures are being taken at the airport in the Afghan capital.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not go into detail on the assessment Biden received from his team one day after a suicide bomber killed 13 US service members and scores of Afghans outside the airport.
Psaki says the next few days of the mission to evacuate Americans and vulnerable Afghans fleeing Taliban rule ‚Äúwill be the most dangerous period to date.‚Äù
Biden has said that he intends to complete the evacuation by his Tuesday deadline.

The statement posted to the US Embassy in Afghanistan website reads: 
Because of security threats at the Kabul airport, we continue to advise U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates.
U.S. citizens who are at the Abbey gate, East gate, North gate or the New Ministry of Interior gate now should leave immediately.

The hurricane is due to make landfall in the US on Sunday, with officials warning of a ‚Äúlife-altering storm‚Äù. The cities of New Orleans and Lafayette, as well as the state capital, Baton Rouge, are under threat from Ida, which is forecast to reach the US somewhere between the parishes of Terrebone and St Mary, slightly west of New Orleans.

The report, issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to Joe Biden‚Äôs request, said a satisfying answer to the question of how a virus that has killed 4.6 million people worldwide started remained out of reach.

The Delta variant doubles the risk of Covid hospitalisation compared with the previously dominant Alpha variant, a new study focused largely on unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people has found.
The analysis ‚Äì based on data collected in England ‚Äì suggests that outbreaks of the Delta variant are likely to put an additional strain on health services, particularly in places with low rates of vaccination.

A public consultation will launch in the autumn and the ban could be in place in a couple of years. The move was welcomed by campaigners, but they said overall progress on cutting plastic waste was ‚Äúsnail-paced‚Äù, with the EU having banned these items and others in July.

From September ‚Äì more than nine months after it was approved for emergency use in the United States ‚Äì the first doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine will arrive on Australian shores. The second mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine against the coronavirus is a welcome boon amid a period of rolling lockdowns and record case numbers.
But Australia‚Äôs notoriously sluggish vaccine rollout has been marred by the failure of a locally developed vaccine candidate, as well as changes to age-group recommendations for the AstraZeneca vaccine as a result of its link to rare but blood clots.

When it resurfaces, the team of scientists are happy to see their US$3,200 satellite tag securely fixed to his side. The whale, whom they have nicknamed ‚ÄúBill‚Äù, slips away into the ocean, the tag transmitting his movements. A few days later, researchers watch as he starts heading west towards Australia.

Odd Christian Eiking stays in red jersey after quiet flat stage

Florian S√©n√©chal sprinted to an unlikely maiden Grand Tour stage victory in stage 13 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a on Friday as Odd Christian Eiking stayed in the red jersey.
The Frenchman, traditionally a one-day classics specialist, was working with his Deceuninck-QuickStep teammates to set up Fabio Jakobsen for the sprint finish, but the Dutchman suffered a flat tyre and urged S√©n√©chal to push for the win instead.

When David Dempsey was arrested in California on Thursday and charged with attacking police officers defending the US Capitol on 6 January, local activists in Los Angeles were not surprised.
Federal prosecutors have accused 34-year-old Dempsey of striking police at the Capitol with improvised weapons, including a crutch and a pole, and spraying them with a chemical agent, according to the criminal complaint against him.

In her first overseas grand slam appearance, Emma Raducanu has swept through the US Open qualifying tournament to reach the main draw, defeating the fourth seed Mayar Sherif of Egypt 6-1, 6-4 in the final qualifying round.
Away from the Wimbledon crowds, the spotlight and any wildcards as in her breakthrough run to the round of 16 there last month, Raducanu gave a comprehensive demonstration of her potential by breezing through the difficult qualifying draw without dropping a set. She was later joined in the main draw by Katie Boulter, the 25-year-old from Leicester, after she beat Slovakia‚Äôs Kristina Kucova 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 in their qualifying tie.

Olivia Miller dazzles in this tart and punky solo show, which reimagines the Tudor monarch as an in-yer-face Gen-Z teen
You might consider the fraught life of Mary Tudor, England‚Äôs first queen, for a long time before thinking: standup comedy. But that‚Äôs the leap Olivia Miller has made with this punky solo, first performed in her home town of New York. It reimagines Mary as an in-yer-face Gen-Z teen, back from the dead to reprise her lurid life story, defend her name and justify that small matter of 280 heretics burned alive.
She makes a good fist of it. In fishnets and bovver boots, Miller shows off her standup chops, if not always in the quality of the jokes then in the dazzle and charm with which she brings her crowd on side. The repeated technique is to mine inappropriate intimacies (‚Äúraise your hand if you‚Äôve imagined your parents having sex?‚Äù), then demonstrate how our experiences can‚Äôt touch hers. Her parents‚Äô sex life is a matter of national debate, while Mary is put on the marriage market from two years old. Her mum is then exiled, never to be seen again, while dad upends a kingdom, affronts God and murders multiple wives, all to right the wrong of Mary‚Äôs unsatisfactory gender.

The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. It‚Äôs a good line ‚Äì an inspirational quote for a tea towel or a meme, very much the tea towels of the Instagram age.
The quote itself actually comes from John Stuart Mill‚Äôs inaugural address at St Andrews University in 1867: ‚ÄúBad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.‚Äù It‚Äôs unlikely Mill was thinking of tea towels or memes when he said it. Nor you suspect was he referring to how Gary Rowett might be feeling a century and a half later. But the Millwall manager now finds himself in the unenviable position of being a good man looking on.

It was a luxurious slow burn of a third day at Headingley, one of those days when the moments all seem to blur into a kind of ambient hum, a day when nothing is wasted and nothing is resolved, when everything is moving but nobody is going anywhere. India‚Äôs batters seemed content to mark out time; England‚Äôs bowlers and fielders ran in with purpose but little urgency; the clouds drifted; the electronic advertising boards quietly scrolled their wares.
Partly this was a function of the surface, slow and lifeless and seemingly in no hurry at all. Partly it was the state of the match, with England dominant and India playing largely for pride and thoughts already beginning to turn to the Oval and Manchester. Partly it was a function of the serene Cheteshwar Pujara, who is the sort of batsman who slows the game to his own pace: batting until one can no longer remember a time before he started batting nor can envisage a time when he no longer will be.

                    <span>The attack on Kabul airport underlines the west‚Äôs obligations, which do not end with the occupation 
For all that it had been warned of, was perhaps even half-expected, Thursday‚Äôs terrorist attack on Kabul‚Äôs Hamid Karzai airport was a deeply shocking event. The setting for the final unravelling of the west‚Äôs failure was already frightening. Thousands of people had struggled for days to gain access to the buildings and officials that they hoped would offer them a passport to safety. With Islamic State‚Äôs attack, which began not far from the Baron Hotel where British personnel were based, and is so far known to have killed 79 civilians and 13 US service people, what had been a worst-case scenario became reality.
Islamic State‚Äôs Afghan affiliate, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province and also as Isis-K, detonated a bomb that not only ripped apart lives, but also served as a bloodcurdling warning of what it may be capable of. Joe Biden, unsurprisingly, responded with a threat of his own: ‚ÄúWe will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,‚Äù he said, following the carnage, addressing the terrorists directly for the benefit of an appalled domestic audience.

                    <span>This year‚Äôs concerts have been a triumph for UK orchestras. And no jingoism necessary
The BBC Proms, the last night of which is on 11 September, are on their way to achieving the near impossible: an almost complete season, with live audiences, despite the pandemic. London‚Äôs Royal Albert Hall may have been quieter than usual, but it has still welcomed audience members who are double-vaccinated, or have tested negative, by the thousands into its expansive auditorium. In the meantime, millions have listened to the broadcasts on BBC Radio 3, or watched the concerts on iPlayer or on television.
Beneath the smooth surface, there have been many last-minute programme changes and artist swaps, as conductors and soloists booked to travel from overseas have encountered obstacles. On a number of occasions, UK-based artists have stepped in to fill the breach. In fact, the whole season, if one were so minded, might be seen as a tribute to the excellence of British orchestras, which ‚Äì with the exception of the Berlin-headquartered Mahler Chamber Orchestra ‚Äì have been the mainstay of this year‚Äôs season. That not only goes for the BBC orchestras, which always provide the concerts‚Äô backbone, but also smaller, younger ensembles, such as Chineke! and the Manchester Collective.

It is a mantra heard less often these days, that the government will ‚Äúfollow the science‚Äù over Covid, and for good reason. As current uncertainty over the UK‚Äôs vaccine programme shows, there are times when science and politics can lead you in very different directions.
NHS England is preparing for the rollout of both third ‚Äúbooster‚Äù Covid vaccines and to extend vaccinations to the bulk of 12- to 15-year-olds, while the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) hopes one or both these will begin in early September.

Two Britons and the child of a British national have been confirmed to be among those killed in the Kabul airport attack.

A document released on Friday revealed that scientists on the modelling group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have issued a fresh alarm about the impact of schools reopening in encouraging the spread of infections.

About three dozen unaccompanied Afghan children have been placed in US government custody after being evacuated from Afghanistan during the hurried withdrawal in recent weeks, US officials told Reuters.
The children arrived at the Kabul airport without a parent or legal guardian and were referred to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) refugee office upon arriving in the United States, according to a US official who requested anonymity to discuss internal government operations.

Few scientists will be surprised by this, and yet the investigation has been the subject of intense ‚Äì and intensely divisive ‚Äì political and media interest over the past three months.

But that won‚Äôt change the fact that two investigations down, we‚Äôre still in the dark as to how this pandemic started.

Edith Sitwell was known for her scathing assessments of her contemporaries as much as for her poetry, famously dismissing FR Leavis a ‚Äútiresome, whining, pettifogging little pipsqueak‚Äù, and DH Lawrence as ‚Äúa plaster gnome on a stone toadstool in some suburban garden‚Äù. Now her address book, which was found among family ephemera at Weston Hall in Northamptonshire, reveals her private takes on those who annoyed her, from the ‚Äúimpertinent Catholic ass‚Äù to the ‚Äúpsychopath who insulted me after television‚Äù.
Sitwell, born into a family of landed gentry, was the eldest of three siblings who all became celebrated writers. She and her brothers Osbert and Sacheverell formed a kind of literary clique that some viewed as a rival to the Bloomsbury set. Her books include The Mother and Other Poems (1915) and Fa√ßade, which were set to music by her protege William Walton.

                    <span>The straight leg hip lift simultaneously activates hamstrings, glutes and core
When we‚Äôre sitting at a desk, we‚Äôre usually in a rounded position. This exercise will encourage us to do the opposite, and strengthens some of the muscles that keep us upright. It used to be part of my gymnastics training warmup as it simultaneously activates hamstrings, glutes and core in an extended position (which can be helpful for posture). Ensure you tuck your tailbone under, and squeeze your glutes to get the most from it.

                    <span>The glossy optimism of the location is a sleight of hand. Old Glasgow has been left to decay
Sailing up the Clyde was once how most travellers from abroad reached Glasgow, as well as those from Ireland, the Hebrides and the peninsulas of Argyll. Passenger liners came right up the river to within a mile of the city centre from New York and Boston and imperial cities where Scottish influence was particularly marked: Calcutta, Rangoon, Halifax, Montreal. As late as the 1960s, a traveller could step ashore in Glasgow having embarked in Dublin, Belfast or Bombay, though by that time the bigger transatlantic ships were ferrying their passengers ashore in the deeper water off Greenock, 25 miles downstream.
This trade contracted slowly in the last 50 years of the last century, and then suddenly it vanished. Other port cities have been similarly deserted, but perhaps in none of them, even New York, did the loss feel so confounding. Glasgow, after all, had seen a steamship long before it saw a steam locomotive; the first commercially successful steamboat in Europe began operating on the Clyde in 1812, beaten only to a global first (so Glasgow patriots reckoned) by the sharp practice of an American who had stolen the idea and put it to work on the Hudson. Today, the last vessel to perpetuate this two-centuries-old tradition is the elegant paddle steamer Waverley, built in 1947, which sails to and from Glasgow for two or three months every summer and whose near-miraculous survival is a testament to the love that Britain affords old machines.

                    <span>Writer and creator of the animated children‚Äôs series Roobarb, featuring an adventurous green dog and Custard the pink cat
Grange Calveley, who has died after suffering a stroke aged 78, was the creator and writer of Roobarb, the visually groundbreaking, popular cartoon series screened on British television in the early 1970s, during a golden age of children‚Äôs animation. His inspiration came when he and his wife, Hanny, moved into a new Hertfordshire home and bought a Welsh border collie. ‚ÄúWe came to live in this lovely house with its big garden, its shed and its old conker tree,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúOh, and the rhubarb that grew under an old rusty bucket. That‚Äôs about when our four-legged Welsh friend moved in and the first thing he did was to water the rhubarb. And, from that moment on, we called him Roobarb.‚Äù
Calveley started drawing sketches of a dog‚Äôs adventures and kept knocking on the door of the BBC, imploring it to take up his idea, which also featured a cat called Custard, based on his neighbours‚Äô pet. The pre-school children‚Äôs show Play School considered his stories too short for its 15-minute slot, but Calveley was persistent and finally able to sell his idea when the Australian-born director Bob Godfrey ‚Äì who had already made a cartoon series featuring the Beatles and mock-erotic short films such as Kama Sutra Rides Again ‚Äì suggested producing a 30-second black-and-white sample.

                    <span>Afghanistan‚Äôs new rulers are far better equipped than the US and its allies to take the fight to the Kabul airport bombers
After the bloodshed at Kabul airport, the grim reality for those who want to prevent Islamic State‚Äôs affiliate causing further murder and mayhem in Afghanistan is that in practice their best partner for this complex and difficult battle would be the Taliban.
Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ‚Äì the name is borrowed from that used by early Islamic empires to describe much of modern Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan ‚Äì was founded six years ago. Until this week it had been something of a failure. Though the group made early gains, these were rapidly lost as the Taliban fought back hard: they were not going to allow an upstart newcomer, particularly one largely composed of disaffected former Taliban commanders, Pakistanis and Uzbeks, to take over.

                    <span>Frank Herbert‚Äôs sprawling sci-fi saga completely defeated Alejandro Jodorowsky in the 1970s, while David Lynch hates his own compromised 1984 version. Is the third time a charm?
What kind of fool of a film-maker would proceed with part one of a major fantasy epic without first establishing that the studio backing it will stump up the cash for part two? That was the position Ralph Bakshi found himself in when his divisive 1978 animated take on JRR Tolkien‚Äôs Lord of the Rings failed to wow critics, and it‚Äôs the one Denis Villeneuve finds himself in with regard to his forthcoming take on Frank Herbert‚Äôs space fantasy Dune, which arrives in cinemas and on the streaming service HBO on 22 October.
There is no doubt that the first big-screen take on this tale of interstellar rivalries since David Lynch‚Äôs 1984 misfire has hype in spades. Early trailers featuring Timoth√©e Chalamet as the messianic Paul Atreides, as well as a stellar cast including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem, wowed sci-fi fans. But then, Villeneuve‚Äôs previous sci-fi spectacular, Bladerunner 2049, was similarly a fan favourite and earned rapturous reviews, yet ended up with a middling box-office take. All talk of a third movie swiftly evaporated.

The damning verdict on John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam was made in 1973 by Morecambe and Wise, newly discovered film footage reveals. They were not only boring but ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù and that was ‚Äúirritating‚Äù, the comedy duo said.

The Gogglebox star Andy Michael has died at the age of 61 after a short illness, a statement from Channel 4 and Studio Lambert on behalf of his family has said.
The family first appeared on Gogglebox in its debut episode in 2013, but announced in 2014 that they were leaving because Michael was standing for Ukip in the general election.

Employers wake up to benefits of siesta

History is littered with famous power nappers, with Aristotle, Einstein and Winston Churchill all having embraced daytime snoozes of varying duration, while Homer‚Äôs Odyssey references polyphasic sleeping in separate chunks.
During the second world war, Churchill would nap for at least an hour in the early afternoon, writing in his war memoirs: ‚ÄúNature had not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without the refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts 20 minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces.‚Äù

                    <span>After lockdown some businesses understand better how flexible working hours enhance productivity
A three-hour break in the middle of the working day for a languorous lunch, followed by a restorative nap sounds like the Mediterranean dream, but employers in Spain are increasingly moving away from this rigid schedule, which for many workers feels more like a nightmare. 
The merits of introducing the siesta in the UK have been hotly debated this week after the National Trust unveiled plans to move towards ‚ÄúMediterranean working hours‚Äù at some sites in the south-east, to help cope with rising annual temperatures.

‚ÄòSafety and wellbeing is paramount‚Äô 
For many parents and children, the prospect of returning to school again in September should be an exciting one, but concerns are natural too. It‚Äôs something Munif Zia, principal of Hinde House academy in Sheffield has been working hard to alleviate.
Pupils can now look forward to a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù return, with the easing of restrictions meaning bubbles and social distancing will no longer be mandatory ‚Äì although such protective steps may be reintroduced in schools where there is a high prevalence of Covid across the whole school. Start and finish times will no longer need to be staggered, and face coverings will no longer be advised ‚Äì although schools may choose to maintain some of these measures.

Loafers, blazers, argyle and rugby shirts might sound more like classic boomer wardrobe staples, but with the preppy look back in fashion they are also increasingly likely to be found on 20-somethings this autumn.
In fact, the preppy look is threatening to oust the streetwear that has dominated young people‚Äôs style for the past decade. The luxury resale site The Real Real reports that searches for the streetwear brands Vetements and Yeezy are down 24 and 25% respectively, while searches for the classic preppy brand Ralph Lauren are up by 238%. Depop, meanwhile, has recorded a 57% increase in searches for ‚Äúprep‚Äù or ‚Äúpreppy‚Äù since June, with searches for Ralph Lauren up by 29%.

                    <span>A dark Surrey manor house gives its new American family a chilly welcome in Sean Durkin‚Äôs 80s-set ghost story cum emotional parable
Is it a ghost story? A parable of family dysfunction? Or perhaps a fever dream of neoliberalism‚Äôs troubled birth in the Thatcher-Reagan 80s and the special relationship of greed and good? Or is this rivetingly strange movie an adaptation of some 70s or 80s novel that we had somehow all forgotten about: something by Iris Murdoch, or maybe Piers Paul Read? The Nest‚Äôs director is film-maker Sean Durkin, his first since the intriguing quasi-Manson cult drama Martha Marcy May Marlene from 2011, and however much it feels like an adaptation, this is his own original screenplay ‚Äì and very original.
The setting is the mid-1980s, with news about President Reagan on the radio and everyone smoking indoors, and the story begins in the handsome suburban home in upstate New York of Rory O‚ÄôHara, an expatriate Briton played by Jude Law. He has made a fortune as a commodity trader in Manhattan and one morning high-handedly tells his American wife Allison (Carrie Coon), stepdaughter Sam (Oona Roche) and young son Ben (Charlie Shotwell) that he has accepted a job offer from his old boss in the City of London. Restless, mercurial, fast-talking Rory evidently has a yen to return in triumph to his old stamping ground, and maybe cautiously reconnect with his glowering widowed mum ‚Äì a terrifically potent cameo from Anne Reid.

Holed up in a town over the bridge from her adopted home of Lisbon, she spent the pandemic getting over a relationship, DJing on Soho Radio, starting a record label and teaching herself how to craft gorgeous, sun-dappled sad bangers.

As we argue over heat pumps and electric car charging sockets here in the UK, it is undeniable that most of our homes have a long way to go to be eco-friendly.
To reach net zero, we are going to have to change how we heat our houses. The way they are built will probably have to change, too. Perhaps the ubiquitous squat brick suburban house will become a thing of the past. Hopefully so will our Victorian pipe system and, for those of us who rent, our ancient boilers which make a disturbing noise.

While Paris‚Äôs winding Seine has been an inspiration for some of the greatest works of romantic art and literature, the unloved Senne running through Brussels has been buried away under concrete for the last 150 years, condemned by locals as little more than a sewer and cause of disease and unhappiness.
As a constant flood risk and source of cholera, it was vaulted in, built over and hidden from sight. Now, however, Belgium‚Äôs capital is preparing to stage an inauguration ceremony that officials hope will help force a rethink among Bruxellois about their centuries-held prejudices against the waterway.

Many seeds grew to make this book. My mother reading myths to me as a child. The teacher who taught me Greek. An independent LGBTQ+ bookstore near my house in Philadelphia called Giovanni‚Äôs Room, filled with luminous, potent stories.
But if I have to name a single beginning, it was the early months of 2000. I was about to graduate with my classics degree and begin a master‚Äôs. I was already working on my thesis, on a topic that had long frustrated me: the way that some scholarship dismissed the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, labelling them ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù. I‚Äôd read Plato‚Äôs Symposium, where Achilles and Patroclus are not just presented as lovers, but the ideal romantic relationship. I knew that interpreting their relationship as romantic was a very old idea, and I was angry at the way homophobia was erasing this reading.

The images plastered across our screens in recent days of Afghan civilians at Hamid Karzai airport desperately trying to flee the country, as well as the bombing on Thursday, have been heartbreaking. And, for me, slightly surreal. I lived in that airport while serving as a soldier in the British army.
Watching the scenes of chaos on the tarmac, my first thought was for the civilians who worked inside the airport. I spent many afternoons after work sitting in the Afghan-owned Istanbul Cafe, a ramshackle building of several floors that overlooked the airfield, drinking the strong coffee prepared by woman and men I came to know and respect. Their journey into work every morning was 10 times as dangerous as anything I ever did in Kabul. They ran the gauntlet on bicycles while we took shelter inside armoured vehicles. I cannot help but wonder: are they safe? Did they get out?

Sherry Dorathy has long lived in Miami, Arizona, a small, once prosperous copper mining town tucked behind rugged hills and wind-carved rock formations.
A former special education teacher, she‚Äôs now the gentle-voiced superintendent of the Miami Unified school district 40. The district, like at least 13 others in the Grand Canyon state, requires students and staffers to wear masks indoors amid Arizona‚Äôs dangerous new surge of Covid-19 spurred by the Delta variant.

Holiday keepsakes and souvenirs are a great reminder of the places we‚Äôve visited and the trips we‚Äôve enjoyed ‚Äì but while it might be traditional to bring home a fridge magnet, tea towel or local wine, they are not the only options. With this in mind, we want to hear about your most unusual holiday souvenirs.

Nicholas Shaxson is a co-founder of the Balanced Economy Project

While swathes of the economy splutter back to life, desperately attempting to survive after 18 months on life support, not everyone is struggling equally. The City of London is fire-hosing private equity firms with money, spurring them to borrow and buy up corporate Britain at a furious rate. The latest big target is Morrisons, which just agreed a $9.5bn (¬£6.9bn) takeover offer by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R). It‚Äôs not the first supermarket chain to have caught the attention of private equity tycoons: Asda took a big private equity investment last year from TDR Capital, alongside the Issa brothers.
But private equity‚Äôs appetite goes far beyond supermarkets. In the first half of 2021 there were 785 private equity deals in the UK with a combined value of almost ¬£74bn, according to KPMG. Telecoms, business services, IT, veterinary services and even children‚Äôs social care have all caught the eye of investors hungry for cut-price acquisitions. ‚ÄúPrivate equity is rampant,‚Äù said Martin Sorrell, the influential advertising boss.‚Äâ‚ÄúThey are the dominant force now.‚Äù

Kysty is a restaurant in Ambleside, where the entire country and their dogs seem to be holidaying right now. This is reasonable: during an enthusiastically invasive PCR test in the back room of a Madeiran chemist earlier this month, it struck me that it might have been far easier to stay in Britain. In the Lakes, maybe, where, yes, it may well pelt with rain throughout August, but you can at least get there quickly without entering an MC Escher hellscape of contradictory pre-flight government websites.
You can also leave easily, too ‚Äì after a nice scone and a look at Todd Crag ‚Äì and without paying some private medical charlatan ¬£70 for the ‚Äúpurchase code‚Äù for a ‚Äúday two landing test‚Äù, which you post off and they sling in a hedge. We are fortunate that the British Isles are so beautiful and varied, because only the very determined are leaving on a jet plane right now. Ambleside is particularly charming, because it‚Äôs a hodge-podge of cosy cafes, country pubs, climbing walls and art galleries, as well as home to roughly 86 places where you can buy Romney‚Äôs mint cake and quick-lock anti-shock trekking poles to take home and use on Clapham Common.

                    <span>The end of summer is a pivotal moment for hospitals, care homes and schools, where there is a palpable sense of mounting anxiety
Burnout is a word too often overused.
It‚Äôs more than just the September blues, that sluggish end of summer unwillingness to get back to the office. It‚Äôs not just about feeling stressed or exhausted or overwhelmed, either, but about feeling all of those things all the time, plus a gnawing sense of hopelessness on top. What‚Äôs the point of endlessly pushing boulders uphill, only for them to roll back down tomorrow? Is this really what you trained for? And at its worst, it‚Äôs compounded by what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúmoral injury‚Äù, or feeling forced into acting against professional and personal conscience. It‚Äôs not just about what happens in the working day, but the things that keep you awake at night.

                    <span>The party is set to become a partner to the SNP. Yet even though climate concerns are growing, it faces a raft of new challenges
Green politics in Britain has always had a problem with scale. The disparity between the damage being done to the planet and the forces mobilised against it, in electoral politics and on the streets, has so far been painfully stark.
The first British Green party (originally called the People party) was founded in the early 1970s, when anxiety about the environment was almost as widespread as it is now. Its initial election manifesto was based on A Blueprint for Survival ‚Äì a bestselling book that warned of ‚Äúthe breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet‚Äù if the economic status quo continued. Yet it took another 37 years, until 2010, for Britain to elect its first Green MP, Caroline Lucas. The representative for Brighton Pavilion still remains the only Green in the Commons.
Our electoral system‚Äôs hostility to new parties has obviously held the
Greens back. But so has the tendency of environmental emergencies to leave voters feeling overwhelmed and paralysed, or in denial. Meanwhile in protest politics, even the clarity and ingenuity of groups such as Extinction Rebellion often seem to have only a fleeting impact. When its city-centre roadblocks have been cleared away, the usual traffic and consumerism return, almost as if nothing has happened. Green politics, somehow both too big and too small to gain sustained mainstream attention, seems stuck in its niche.
But there are signs that this may finally be changing. Last week the Scottish Greens announced a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish National party. If it is accepted at a members‚Äô meeting on Saturday, the Scottish Greens will become the first British Green party to enter government.

This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from earlier in the year. This episode was first broadcast on 21 January.
Rachel Humphreys talks to the Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman about the television show Sex and the City. Last week the US streaming service HBO Max announced that the series will be returning under a new title, And Just Like That, and will feature the original stars apart from Kim Cattrall. Hadley tells Rachel why she thinks the original show was such a huge success ‚Äì offering a potent mix of escapism with serious, well-written plot lines that she feels sing with ‚Äúemotional truth‚Äù. Hadley notes that SATC is often singled out for criticism over its lack of diversity while other shows of that era such as the HBO series The Sopranos do not invite the same level of criticism.

The state‚Äôs governor has dispatched about 1,500 national guard troops to hospitals in the state and reinstated a mask mandate.

Having seen their initial bid of ‚Ç¨160m rejected this week after the PSG sporting director, Leonardo, said the offer was ‚Äúnot sufficient‚Äù, Madrid have returned with what they see as their final offer for a player whose contract expires at the end of this season.

                    <span>High marks for this emotionally pulverising documentary about a gang of teenagers starting their GCSEs mid-pandemic
Just about any documentary set in a school, among the scramble of children bulging this way and that and the tensile network of teachers arching protectively over them, is emotionally exhausting. If you have the slightest bit of imagination, empathy or compassion ‚Äì the slightest bit of sentience, really ‚Äì you cannot fail to sit back at the end of every one, exhale deeply and exclaim: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how they do it.‚Äù
Add Covid and a focus on the GCSE years to that little lot ‚Äì as Sixteen: Class of 2021 (Channel 4) does ‚Äì and you can expect to be pulverised. This is the first of a series of four films in which we follow the year 11s of the Link Academy in Dudley, in the West Midlands, as they return to school in September 2020, after the first lockdown. The previous year group had their exams scrapped, and grades given on the basis of mock results. As such, we learn that the year 11 mocks have been brought forward, in an attempt to mitigate disaster in the event of another lockdown.

Kane makes first start of season after agreeing to stay

Harry Kane showed his renewed commitment to his club‚Äôs cause by scoring twice on his first start of the season. Passage to the group stages of the Europa Conference League, which Giovani Lo Celso secured by claiming a third goal, may not be the summit of Spurs‚Äô ambitions but Kane‚Äôs role in a rousing team performance lifted the mood music around Tottenham.
A day after pledging his immediate future to Spurs, and perhaps while still trying to block out envious thoughts about the draw for the group stages of the Champions League, Kane made his first start of the season ‚Äì in Europe‚Äôs third-tier club competition.

Work to reinforce the foundation of Millennium tower in the city‚Äôs downtown came to a halt this week, after engineers found the building had sunk 1in in the months since work began. Engineers were working on reinforcing the foundation of the tower to prevent additional tilting and sinking.

Group A is by by some distance the toughest, featuring the defeated finalist of the past two seasons, plus RB Leipzig, who reached the semi-final two seasons ago. There will be a repeat of last season‚Äôs semi-final, in which Manchester City comfortably overcame Paris Saint-Germain in a battle of two mega-rich petro-clubs. City‚Äôs problem tends to come later in the competition as Pep Guardiola overthinks a major tie, but for once progress will not be straightforward against a PSG now bolstered by Lionel Messi and, perhaps more consequentially, Achraf Hakimi, Sergio Ramos and Gini Wijnaldum. Leipzig may not quite be so strong this season, in transition after Jesse Marsch replaced Julian Nagelsmann as coach, while Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahmim Konat√© have left. Club Brugge have never made it through the group stage.

The atmosphere was febrile: hours earlier, shots were fired to disperse an angry crowd as an Italian military transport plane carrying nearly 100 Afghan civilians took off, one of hundreds of foreign and private evacuation flights over the past 12 days.

Confusion is growing over whether all children aged 12 and over will soon be offered a Covid jab as schools in England prepare to return next week, with the NHS gearing up for vaccinations but government scientists warning of potential complications.
Amid uncertainty over the parallel issue of who may be given a third, ‚Äúbooster‚Äù, jab the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is understood to have concerns on issues including knock-on effects on other childhood vaccinations, and the logistics of a mass programme for 12- to 15-year-olds.

                    <span>Unite‚Äôs general secretary is more interested in the industrial struggle than the political one. For workers, that could be a blessing
The surprise election of Sharon Graham to head Britain‚Äôs biggest trade union, Unite, is more about the labour movement than the Labour party. Her victory represents a desire to make organised labour matter rather than let it sleepwalk into irrelevance. Ms Graham‚Äôs rise through Unite has been marked both by her attention to policy detail and a willingness to mobilise the power of workers to secure better terms and conditions. With a base in the union‚Äôs shop stewards, her arrival in the top job represents the triumph of workplace concerns over a leadership style that prioritised political positioning.
Unlike her defeated male rivals, Unite‚Äôs new general secretary is not beholden to any section of the bureaucracy. Over the past 40 years, this union machine has sent officials to negotiate with bosses from a position of weakness. Unite‚Äôs bark has been worse than its bite. Ms Graham‚Äôs pitch was that she wanted to force change in the workplace, not have change forced on workers. A leftwinger, her manifesto is open about Unite exercising its strike muscle to deter bullying employers.

                    <span>It is no surprise that anxiety is increasing, nor that it is distributed unequally. More money for mental health services is needed
It is 10 years since the UK government began to measure happiness. As part of its annual population survey, the official statistics body now asks interviewees questions about their satisfaction, mood and sense of life being ‚Äúworthwhile‚Äù. Not surprisingly, given present circumstances, the news at the moment is not good. While there isn‚Äôt a full decade‚Äôs worth of data yet, the most recent findings were on the gloomy side: measures of personal wellbeing significantly worsened in 2020, while anxiety reached record highs.
In a pandemic, what would you expect? Not joy, for sure. But Covid is far from the only shadow looming over us. The climate emergency and declining living standards are the most obvious reasons for pessimism. Many younger people, in particular, are filled with fears about a future that older people may never see, while millions face an increasingly difficult struggle to secure the basics of life (housing, food, health). Citizens Advice has warned that the upcoming ¬£20 a week cut to universal credit could drive 2.3 million people into debt.

Afghanistan ‚Äì live updates

A last-ditch attempt to evacuate all the British embassy guards on one of the final flights out of Afghanistan has failed, leaving them increasingly frightened about their future.
The international security company GardaWorld, which employed about 200 Afghan staff on contracts to protect the British embassy in Kabul, arranged 10 buses to collect their former employees to take them to the airport before dawn on Thursday.

A vast patch of warming water off the coast of New Zealand ‚Äì referred to as a ‚Äúwarming blob‚Äù ‚Äì has contributed to a decade long drought affecting parts of South America, according to scientists.
Researchers based in New Zealand and Chile have examined the rapidly warming hot blob which rose to prominence in 2019 after spikes in water temperature of up to 6C were recorded.

The Scottish government hopes the package of support material, released on Thursday, would ‚Äúembed anti-racism and race equality into all aspects of school life‚Äù ‚Äì and includes new guidance from Education Scotland on normalising diversity within the curriculum.

We have hardly slept over the last week. We have been following every lead and glimmer of hope to try to achieve this. We managed to get some of the women out, thanks to our wonderful British soldiers on the ground.

Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates are pressing Joe Biden to take new steps to end an immigration policy begun by his predecessor, Donald Trump, after the US supreme court ordered that the controversial ‚ÄúRemain in Mexico‚Äù program be reinstated.
The policy put in place by Trump, forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await US hearings, instead of being allowed to cross the US-Mexico border and follow their legal process, which can take years to play out, on American soil.

Has the pandemic killed off the ‚Äúrevenge dress‚Äù? This week, Kacey Musgraves teased her new album and short film Star-Crossed. The releases come after her divorce and there are deep echoes of Beyonc√©‚Äôs Lemonade. Billed as a ‚Äútragedy told in three acts‚Äù, the film uses fashion to tell her breakup story, but there is no ‚Äúrevenge dress‚Äù look.
Instead, we saw Musgraves in a number of outfits that seemingly semaphore a mix of tragedy and catharsis. There‚Äôs a wedding dress that is worn subversively with some extra high heels and bejewelled eyebrows. There‚Äôs a smattering of red tulle, a balaclava and some angel wings. A closeup image of a corset with a tiny sword through it was posted to her Instagram page after the teaser dropped.

A Thai police chief accused of torturing and killing a suspected drug dealer while in custody, allegedly in an attempt to extort tens of thousands of pounds, has been arrested following a manhunt. 
Thitisan Utthanaphon, 39, who has been removed from his position as superintendent of Muang police station in Nakhon Sawan, north of Bangkok, is accused of trying to extract 2m baht (¬£44,463) from the suspect. He disappeared days before a video of the incident went viral on social media, but was detained by police on Thursday.

Discussion of Graham‚Äôs insurgent victory inevitably turns to what this will mean for Labour. As it was founded by trade unionists, that is inevitable. Yet in many ways it does a disservice to trade unions that we talk about them so much through the prism of the Labour party.

Under the plan outlined to the Guardian by the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, another immediate policy would be to stop new bonds being issued in London to finance oil, coal or gas exploration.

The unprecedented demand for puppies during the pandemic has had serious consequences for animal health and welfare, a study has revealed.
Researchers at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) looked into the impact of the last 16 months on puppy purchasing amid concerns that a huge puppy welfare crisis was unfolding in the UK. They found that while many people who bought dogs during Covid did so with the best intentions, the extreme rise in demand has heightened the risk of puppies being sourced from poor welfare environments, bred or raised on puppy farms, or illegally imported.

Just after I started high school, there was the Cuban missile crisis, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if the world was going to be around much longer. It was a very intense, frightening 13 days, then suddenly it was over and I got into the more mundane problems of being a teenager. I wanted to act, was in plays at school and would read the plays of Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee. The weirder the better. I didn‚Äôt have an outlet for music then. I‚Äôd hated piano lessons. I listened to the usual teenage fare like Frankie Avalon or Bobby Rydell, but the folk music explosion changed everything. My older brother owned a record player and would play old-time country and bluegrass. Nothing did anything for me except Johnny Cash‚Äôs first record, Johnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar! Then suddenly there was Peter, Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Buffy Sainte-Marie. I cherished Dick Cerri‚Äôs radio show Music Americana, the Folk Music of America. Every night, he‚Äôd play the new folk artists I was just becoming aware of and I would sit on my little bedroom floor doing my homework, listening in awe.

As the Taliban started searching their neighbourhood, Abdul and his wife began to hide with different relatives across Kabul. One night they narrowly escaped, fleeing through a back door. Abdul is still carrying the job records and ID documents that could be their only ticket out. But if the Taliban find them first, those same papers could prove a death sentence.
Talking yesterday via a patchy WhatsApp connection, Abdul told me how he‚Äôs been on the run on and off ever since 2012, when he last worked as an interpreter for the British army in Helmand. His was the most dangerous, visible job: scanning locations for traps and other dangers before heavily armoured British troops moved in. Eventually, after threats from distant Taliban relatives, he fled.

                    <span>Lee Pearson triumphed in the Paralympic dressage to claim his 12th gold, and followed it with a heartfelt plea
‚ÄúLove has to prevail, really. Whatever shape or form, I think love has to prevail. If you‚Äôre born with a disability, if you have a child with a disability, if you‚Äôre born with same-sex attraction, if your daughter comes out or your son, then just love them. Nobody wants to be different but we have to embrace different people because that‚Äôs society, that‚Äôs the world. Those different people they‚Äôre not going anywhere. So you can say it‚Äôs illegal, you can make them feel awful, but somewhere in the world another gay boy or girl will be born. Somewhere in the world someone will be born with no limbs. Do you know what I mean? Life goes on and it‚Äôs silly in this day and age when we have countries that are still in the stone age, as we say, 100 years behind. But I‚Äôm just a horse rider. Promise.‚Äù
Some horse rider. On Thursday Sir Lee Pearson scored a comprehensive triumph in the Grade II individual test in dressage, to win the 12th Paralympic gold medal of his career. He did so on the back of a new partner, Breezer (son of Bacardi), and ahead of his great Austrian rival, Pepo Puch. In the stifling heat of the Tokyo afternoon, with the weather warning dropping just below the level local organisers term a ‚Äúdanger‚Äù, Pearson and Breezer, well, breezed home.

Britain‚Äôs economic recovery from the winter lockdown is showing signs of stalling amid shortages of workers and supplies due to the double whammy of Covid and Brexit, according to a Guardian analysis.
Despite the easing of most government pandemic restrictions, consumer caution appears to have crept higher in the past month as the Delta variant fuels a persistently high infection rate. In the meantime, UK businesses have come under pressure from global supply chain disruption and staff shortages.

I will confess that my sleepy heart sang when I read the news that the National Trust would be introducing siestas for its staff. My people, I thought. A French friend of mine notes that Britain is one of the only countries where it is acceptable to withdraw socially for ‚Äúa lie down‚Äù simply because you‚Äôre tired of company, but the working day, in its punishing Protestantism, is a different matter. Part of my dislike of offices, aside from them being the enemy of creativity for anyone who needs peace in which to work, is that there are never enough places to nap.
Naturally, I‚Äôll be met with accusations of laziness for even saying this. We are in the middle of a tedious and strung-out debate about work and flexibility, and a disturbing number of people seem to have Stockholm syndrome. Only yesterday I read a piece in Fortune magazine entitled: ‚ÄúWant to work 9-to-5? Good luck building a career‚Äù. The concept of work/life balance has ‚Äúbecome emblematic of a woke work environment ‚Äì one that acknowledges that an employee base is composed of actual humans, often with spouses, children and outside interests‚Äù, said the writer. God forbid!

                    <span>Campaigners and union leaders praise accord, which replaces one agreed after 2013 Rana Plaza fire
Campaigners have hailed a new agreement designed to protect garment workers in Bangladesh, signed by the likes of H&amp;M and Inditex, which owns Zara and Bershka.
The accord replaces another agreement signed by more than 200 international fashion companies after the Rana Plaza factory fire in 2013, in which more than 1,100 people died. For the first time, these companies faced legal action if their health and safety standards were found lacking or if they did not address problems in an agreed time period. More than 38,000 inspections have been carried out since 2013, and nearly 200 factories have lost their contracts owing to poor safety standards.

Devastating floods across Europe, killer heatwaves in Canada, wildfires across the US. Extreme weather has hit the headlines across the world in the past few weeks, and even climate scientists have been shocked by its severity and extent, which they say is clearly linked to human activity in heating the planet.
It all comes as no surprise to Paul Brown, the Guardian‚Äôs former environment correspondent. He was warning of the consequences of climate change nearly four decades ago, from the mid-1980s, as scientists began to raise the alarm over greenhouse gas emissions and their potential impact.

The government has successfully resisted disclosure of potentially explosive WhatsApp messages between ministers and Boris Johnson about decisions to send hospital patients into care homes without first testing them for Covid.
Two bereaved women whose fathers died from Covid in care homes that received infected NHS patients in April and May 2020 asked the high court to force disclosure of the texts, as well as emails sent from a private account by the then health secretary, Matt Hancock.

The movie might be flawed, but Driver‚Äôs performance (playing opposite the similarly excellent Alba Rohrwacher) is outstanding, winning him the Volpi Cup at the Venice film festival. He plays Jude, a young man who meets his future wife Mina (Rohrwacher) in New York when they are bizarrely locked in a restaurant toilet together. They marry, have a baby and at first everything is wonderful ‚Äì but then she begins to show symptoms of postpartum psychosis and Jude has an agonising dilemma: if and when to take the baby away from her. Driver plays it with overwhelming sincerity and force.

Aaron Dessner and Justin ‚ÄòBon Iver‚Äô Vernon recruit Taylor Swift, Fleet Foxes and more for this album full of misty autumnal beauty ‚Äì and a quiet punch
Aaron Dessner cuts a very low-profile figure, even by the standards of both bookish US alt-rockers and blue-chip pop collaborators, neither of whom require otherworldly charisma or an outrageous image. Put it this way: the New York Times recently ran a lengthy profile piece, lauding his achievements ‚Äì his work on Taylor Swift‚Äôs multi-platinum, Grammy-winning 2020 album Folklore; its follow-up Evermore and her ongoing project to re-record her entire back catalogue; the National‚Äôs 20 year career, including their own Grammy for 2017‚Äôs Sleep Well Beast; his collaboration with Bon Iver‚Äôs Justin Vernon as Big Red Machine ‚Äì and illustrated it with a photo not of Dessner, but his brother Bryce. An easy mistake to make ‚Äì the Dessner brothers are twins ‚Äì but nevertheless.
Dessner, though, seems happy with quiet anonymity. He had to be coaxed from the background to add three lead vocals to Big Red Machine‚Äôs second album, and would doubtless balk at the notion of this collective being a supergroup, although that‚Äôs precisely the label How Long Do You Think It‚Äôs Gonna Last? would have earned them in a previous era. As well as Dessner and Vernon, the album variously features Swift, Fleet Foxes‚Äô Robin Pecknold, Sharon Van Etten, This Is the Kit, Ana√Øs Mitchell ‚Äì the singer-songwriter whose 2010 album Hadestown begat the multiple Tony-winning Broadway musical of the same name ‚Äì Ben Howard, Lisa Hannigan, My Brightest Diamond‚Äôs Shara Nova, and Naeem Juwan, the rapper formerly known as Spank Rock.

Cliff camping seemed like a great idea during the pandemic, when we were craving adventure. After a couple of hours spotting seals, abseiling and rock climbing with our very patient guide, we abseiled down to our bed for the night, and spent the next seven hours lying on a portable ledge above the crashing waves. I spent the night going from laughter to fear. There were some moments of calm however, and we even spotted a few shooting stars.

It is a crisp, sunny day ‚Äì the kind that brings tourists to Montauk, a small fishing village at the end of Long Island, New York. Although the town is better-known as a resort destination, it is the state‚Äôs largest commercial fishing port, only one of two major ports that are still in operation.

                    <span>The 2010 earthquake response was riddled with failure. Haitians cannot afford another catastrophe
The latest statistics from Haiti‚Äôs August 14 earthquake are stark: at least 2,207 people have been confirmed dead and more than 12,000 injured. More than 130,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks continue, and new landslides in the wake of the follow-on Tropical Storm Grace mean those numbers are expected to rise in the coming weeks.
But the most dispiriting number is 11. That is the number of years that passed between Haiti‚Äôs last major earthquake and this one ‚Äì years in which corruption has hollowed out the state, armed gangs have expanded their territorial control, and political turmoil has intensified, culminating in the assassination of the president, Jovenel Mo√Øse, in July.

The north of the island of Lanzarote is a hidden idyll where sunsets burn golden orange and surf pounds the wild shores. Famara Beach is a surfing paradise for families looking for winter sun and a relaxed beach community. Staying in a yurt in nearby Arrieta is fantastic: at night you can watch the stars from your bed as you gently drift asleep listening to the waves. La Graciosa is a 20-minute boat ride away and hosts two tiny but perfect beachside restaurants serving freshly caught sardines. Spanish fills the air and British voices are rare. The mountains here are home to huge agave plants, aloes, bougainvillaea, date palms and pepper trees.

                    <span>Fight to save fish tells story of how European food preferences clashed with tribal systems, shaping what we choose to protect
Perry Chocktoot remembers the last time he ate a C‚Äôwaam suckerfish. It was 1984. The fish was canned by a Klamath Tribes member and served with Tabasco. After finishing off the meat, Chocktoot was left with a tin of smoky fish oil mixed with hot sauce. ‚ÄúWe just tipped it back and drank it,‚Äù Chocktoot recalled. ‚ÄúIt was so good.‚Äù
Just four years later, the C‚Äôwaam and its cousin the Koptu were put on the endangered species list. Since then, for more than three decades, no member of the Klamath Tribes has legally harvested the species, which are endemic to a lake and series of rivers in southern Oregon known as the Klamath Basin and once formed the backbone to the tribes‚Äô seasonal food system.

We are as far away from 1980 now as we were then from 1939. I know that because I read it on the internet. I didn‚Äôt check it, because why would they put it there if it wasn‚Äôt true? Yet at the same time, it is patently absurd; more than ridiculous, mad. In 1980, the late 30s were pure history, and all we could remember about the humans in them was the way they crowded around radios and drank cocktails containing tiny pickled onions. The early 80s, by contrast, were effectively yesterday, and we can all remember them with pin-sharp clarity.
At least, I can: the evidence keeps reminding me that young people can‚Äôt remember the era at all.

If you were to drive through Medford, a small city in southern Oregon, you‚Äôd pass by an unremarkable motel. You‚Äôd see guests sitting out on their balconies, smoking cigarettes, walking their dogs across the small patch of lawn, and watching the kids laugh and play in the pool.
But these people aren‚Äôt typical hotel guests. They are 159 fire refugees, displaced after losing their homes during one of the worst fire seasons the west coast has ever experienced. As the climate crisis causes higher-than-normal temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds, Oregon and California are facing more intense blazes than ever before. This new breed of fires is destroying entire communities ‚Äì the 8 September 2020 conflagration known as the Almeda fire, for instance, decimated two towns in southern Oregon, torched 2,700 houses and displaced 3,000 people.

Food manufacturers have called on ministers to alleviate labour shortages by allowing them to employ prisoners. This comes as other firms, from hauliers to supermarkets, are also finding themselves short of workers for reasons relating to Brexit and the pandemic. Prisoners could indeed help out, if they are given the opportunity to do real work for a real wage ‚Äì but a lot would need to change to make this happen, not least the prisons.
Very few prisoners have the opportunity to do real work, and many would jump at the chance to get out of their cells and do something useful and social that would give them money to support their families and buy little luxuries like soap, some extra food and even enrol in education programmes.

                    <span>Following two anglers into an area of deep forests and swift rivers brings a new appreciation of the mindful appeal of fly-fishing
I first learned about fly-fishing in a story by Truman Capote called Handcarved Coffins. In America‚Äôs midwest, Capote‚Äôs help is solicited by a small-town sheriff stumped by a string of diabolically ingenious murders in his remote farming community. The victims have been killed in ways suggesting intimate knowledge of their habits, yet nowhere is there any apparent motive. In the end Capote has no evidence but meets up with the man he reasons must be the killer. He‚Äôs fly-fishing. Waist-high in a stream, he talks about the ‚Äúwill of God‚Äù. As little as I then knew about the sport, it somehow made perfect sense that the killer would be fly-fishing.
In a larger sense, fly-fishing is a discipline of the mind, about things unseen. In the run-up to my trip to Sweden‚Äôs fly-fishing mecca √Ñlvdalen, four hours north of Stockholm, I listened to fly-fishing stories on the internet. Many are about technique, or about making the ‚Äúflies,‚Äù the tiny lures fly-fishers use; also, oddly, there are a great many tales about fly-fishing as a sort of personal, even spiritual, quest, about people who go to restore a relationship, to help them unravel some knotty issue in their lives or just find peace of mind. Somehow fly-fishing makes that possible.

At the end of the 1990s, when Diane Warren was the unrivalled queen of the power ballad, her music publisher presented her with a quartet of gold discs and a plaque hailing her as ‚Äúthe career saviour of the 90s‚Äù. The discs celebrated the windswept mega-hits Warren had written for Toni Braxton (Un-Break My Heart), LeAnn Rimes (How Do I Live), Celine Dion (Because You Loved Me) and Aerosmith (I Don‚Äôt Want to Miss a Thing), the first two of which are still among the bestselling US singles ever.
To be imperial in one pop era is usually to be defined by it for evermore, but Warren has been writing hits for almost four decades, notching up nine US No 1s and 32 Top 10 hits.

                    <span>The families of some 9/11 victims are still pursuing compensation from those complicit in the attacks ‚Äì but is Sudan, already ravaged by years of US sanctions, really the right target?
Five months after the terrorist strikes by al-Qaida on 11 September 2001, a lawyer named Ron Motley received a phone call from Deena Burnett, whose husband had been killed in the attack. Thomas Burnett, she explained, had been on one of the hijacked planes. She wanted to ask whether he would help her to find a way to sue those responsible for the attack that claimed her husband.
Two weeks after the call, on 2 March 2002, Motley and a team of lawyers with his firm, Motley Rice, spent a day with the Burnett family at their home in California. They described how, upon realising the plane had been taken over for a suicide mission, Thomas Burnett had led the charge on the cockpit on flight 93. He and his fellow passengers managed to divert the plane from its target ‚Äì the White House. The cockpit flight recorder captured his now-famous last words before they stormed the hijackers: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going in!‚Äù Shortly after, the plane crashed, killing all 44 people on board. Burnett was 38 years old.

Alison Webster was once showing prospective students around the university where she was studying medicine when a sixth former said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so old ‚Äì why are you even doing this?‚Äù Webster laughs at the memory, home after the end of a shift as an A&amp;E doctor. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòWhen you go home, ask your mum if she likes her life. I bet there‚Äôs something your mum‚Äôs always wanted to do that she‚Äôs not had the opportunity to do because of you. Ask what her dreams were, and see if she has fulfilled them.‚Äô‚Äù
Webster‚Äôs childhood dream was to be a doctor, but she didn‚Äôt do well in her A-levels, ‚Äúso that got put to one side. But it was always in there.‚Äù She ran a music distribution company, but as she approached her 40s, the business was struggling and she had started to wonder what to do with the rest of her life. Was a career in medicine really out of reach?

Afghanistan withdrawal ‚Äì live updates

It is a treacherous journey of thousands of miles that crosses arid deserts, steep mountains, rivers, armed checkpoints, barbed wire and metres-high concrete walls. But for the Afghans fleeing the Taliban, this inhospitable route ‚Äì traversing Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and into the Balkans ‚Äì is the pathway, they believe, to freedom.
After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban this month, following weeks of rapid successive victories across the country, the instinct of many Afghans has been to escape by any means possible.

                    <span>After 21 competitors died during a 100km mountain race in Gansu province earlier this year, the Chinese government suspended all extreme sports. But those who love ultrarunning insist it can be safe ‚Äì and has changed how they see the world. What keeps them coming back?
This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from the year so far. This episode was first broadcast on 8 June.
To most people, the horror of 21 lives being lost during a race across 100km in a Chinese mountain range will have been amplified by how obscure the sport seems to outsiders. But ultrarunning has boomed in popularity in recent years, with the number of finishers around the world rising from 120,000 to more than 600,000 in a decade. Now there are concerns that in China and beyond, a proliferation of new races has created a risk that safety rules will not always be enforced, and with it a chance that some of the most obsessive participants will discard vital protective equipment in the interests of gaining an advantage over their rivals.

New Zealand is battling to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant that swiftly led to a nationwide, level four lockdown ‚Äì the highest setting ‚Äì which has been extended until at least the end of the week. There are now 210 cases in the community.

                    <span>Cambridge astronomers identify new hycean class of habitable exoplanets, which could accelerate search for life
Signs of life beyond our solar system may be detectable within two to three years, experts have said after rethinking the kinds of planets that may be habitable.
Researchers have mostly looked for planets of a similar size, mass, temperature and atmospheric composition to Earth. But University of Cambridge astronomers believe there may be more promising possibilities after recent work suggested that a ‚Äúmini-Neptune‚Äù more than twice the radius of Earth and more than eight times as massive may also be habitable.

British car factories produced the fewest cars for any July since 1956 as they struggled with worker absences and the global shortage of computer chips.
UK carmakers made 53,400 vehicles in July, a 37.6% drop when compared with the same month in 2020, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry‚Äôs lobby group.

The findings have emerged from a survey of medics by the British Medical Association, which said the results were appalling and the incidents made for shocking reading.

None of us realised how good we had it in 2007, in our pre-Trump, pre-Brexit, pre-Covid bubble. We even had a Labour government, for chrissakes.
And we had Gossip Girl, a perfect confection of madness, the bubbles at the brim of our overfilled cup of complacency. It followed a group of uber-rich Upper East Side New York high schoolers who had names as excellent as their lives. Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester ‚Äì yes, the actors had equally unbelievable names) was the queen bee, while her best friend/frenemy was Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively ‚Äì see!). The permutations of their relationships with Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick), Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford, whose jawline should have got separate billing), poverty-stricken Dan and Jenny Humphreys (Penn Badgley and Taylor Momsen, who lived in a loft apartment in ‚Äì ugh ‚Äì Brooklyn) and Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr) formed the mainstay of the show. There were also the times Blair became the princess of Monaco and Elizabeth Hurley played Nate‚Äôs boss and girlfriend so badly for 14 episodes that it is spoken of only in hushed whispers on the darknet.

Ty Garbin admitted his role in the alleged scheme weeks after his arrest last fall. He is among six men charged in federal court but the only one to plead guilty so far. It was an important victory for prosecutors as they try to prove the other five men were involved in the astonishing plot.

Wigan on the brink of dropping out of Super League‚Äôs play-offs

Sometimes, the statistics speak entirely for themselves. Wigan Warriors are one of rugby league‚Äôs most famous and successful clubs but there is no doubting that at present this proud sporting institution are simply not at the races ‚Äì and they are now on the brink of dropping out of Super League‚Äôs play-off places altogether.
For the first time since 1991, Wigan have failed to score at home. They have gone over 200 minutes without scoring a try. The Warriors have not failed to score a try at home in consecutive games for almost 60 years, dating back to 1965. Given the lofty standards Wigan have created for themselves throughout rugby league history, those numbers scream more about their current plight than this result or performance ever could.

Against a Championship club‚Äôs reserves, admittedly, but this was a demonstration from which Mikel Arteta and his team can take heart.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his first start of the season, and Nicolas P√©p√©, Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette also netted in a match in which the visitors threatened to score nearly every time they attacked. Now all they have to do is play like this regularly against stronger opponents. Then trust will grow in Arsenal‚Äôs players and Arteta‚Äôs process.

Guileless hero Christopher Blank is ‚Äòborn without a single funny bone in his body‚Äô in a one-man play that paints a near future US in broad brushstrokes
Comedians becoming politicians and pundits. Politicians playing the lovable buffoon. Are we edging into a world that overvalues humour and ostracises the serious-minded? That‚Äôs the dystopia imagined in John Feffer‚Äôs one-man play, which traces the journey of Christopher Blank, ‚Äúborn without a single funny bone in his body‚Äù, through a near-future US where a lack of humour is a crime. It‚Äôs a grabby premise and I‚Äôm absolutely here for an inquiry into the insidious uses of humour in public life. But its relationship to our current reality feels tenuous.
Not that there‚Äôs any gainsaying Feffer‚Äôs expertise: by day, he‚Äôs a foreign policy expert at Washington DC‚Äôs Institute for Policy Studies. In a performance recorded at Baltimore Theatre Project earlier this year, he plays both our guileless hero Christopher and the wisecracking Groucho Marx-alike President Gumball; other characters are projected (video design by Kelly Colburn and Dylan Uremovich) on to a stacked-boxes set. We watch as social misfit Christopher is cast out by his uncomprehending parents, co-opted at university by a revolutionary cadre of humour-phobes, then caught up in a cold war between the US and the so-called Federation, a USSR-alike where jokes are strictly samizdat.

It‚Äôs 11.23am and Virat Kohli is jogging down the Headingley steps. The sky is a watery grey, the air is thick with cheers and boos and India are four for two. In his 15-year career as a batter and captain, Kohli has pretty much seen it all. He has played international cricket in 17 countries, overcome adversity of every sort, faced down every kind of challenge in every format. But he has never won the toss at Headingley before.

Afghanistan: live updates

British nationals of Afghan origin are being overlooked in the evacuation from Kabul, lawyers and campaigners have claimed, as Dominic Raab said nearly all single-nationality UK citizens had been airlifted from the Taliban-controlled country.
About 50 British citizens, many with dual Afghan nationality, were understood to be outside Kabul airport on Wednesday. Some said they were waving their UK passports aloft in a desperate effort to flee as the deadline for western forces‚Äô departure closed in.

There are several reasons to commit hours of your life to a TV series: to be provoked, to laugh, to explore universal elements of the human condition, to become totally absorbed, to be turned on by voyeurism, fashion/wealth porn or hotness, to have fun (whether intentionally or not). Nine Perfect Strangers, the Hulu limited series which premiered on 18 August, would appear to offer at least some of these draws.

The government is under pressure to relax post-Brexit migration rules to unblock Britain‚Äôs worst supply-chain crisis since the 1970s, with business leaders warning that continued disruption could ruin Christmas.
Industry bosses said urgent changes to the visa system were required as retailers struggle to keep shelves stocked, and restaurants run out of food and drink in the meltdown triggered by Covid and Brexit.

Most of the system that puts food on the 21st-century table is a mystery to the consumer, who is usually happy in ignorance. If the complex logistics ‚Äì picking, processing, packing, and distributing ‚Äì make headlines it is because something has gone wrong.
Currently, two very big things have gone wrong, leading to gaps on supermarket shelves. One is the pandemic, which has slowed the movement of goods and people across borders, while raising shipping costs. Any broken link in global supply chains causes a cascade of disruption which affects many countries. But Britain has a second, aggravating condition to contend with ‚Äì Brexit.

                    <span>Richer countries must wake up and see the bigger Covid picture
The statistics are stark and shaming. During an exasperated intervention earlier this week, the World Health Organization‚Äôs director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that of 4.8bn Covid vaccine doses delivered around the world to date, around 75% have gone to just 10 countries. The level of vaccine donations from richer countries, he added with some understatement, has been ‚Äúreally disappointing‚Äù. In Africa, where a third wave of the virus has been on the march since May, less than 2% of the continent‚Äôs population has received a first dose. While high-income countries across the globe have administered around 100 doses for every 100 citizens, the equivalent figure for low-income countries is 1.5.
As a consequence, while the United States, Britain and other richer nations begin to roll out programmes for booster shots in the autumn, a pandemic of the unvaccinated continues unabated elsewhere. The WHO‚Äôs target of reaching 10% of the population of every country with a first shot by the end of September is unlikely to be met. This grotesque inequity, as Mr Ghebreyesus and others have repeatedly pointed out, is ultimately in no one‚Äôs interest. Allowing much of the planet to operate as a variant factory, and the more transmissible Delta variant to run riot, stores up trouble for the future. ‚ÄúVaccinating the world‚Äù should therefore be seen as sound strategy as well as an ethical obligation. But, in Europe and North America, early good intentions have so far come a distant second to domestic priorities.

When coronavirus hit international fashion manufacturing centres last year, many Australian designers pivoted to making clothes onshore. But as Sydney‚Äôs lockdown extends into the second half of 2021, garment factories are struggling to stay open and the long-term viability of manufacturing in Australia is under threat.
Sydney‚Äôs inner west is usually a busy hub of clothing manufacturing. But the machinists who power this industry often commute in from the city‚Äôs south west, an area subject to the strictest lockdown orders in New South Wales.

Yodel‚Äôs lorry drivers are voting whether to go on strike in a move that could worsen the UK‚Äôs supply chain crisis.
The GMB union said it had opened a ballot on industrial action for more than 250 of its members on Wednesday, after failing to reach an agreement with Yodel over pay and working conditions affecting the delivery company‚Äôs lorry drivers.

Police deploy Taser stun guns too often, with black people more likely to face prolonged use lasting over five seconds, an official report has found. 
The study by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) warned of a loss of legitimacy after a review of 101 Taser cases from 2015-20. They represent the most serious cases it investigated, and a fraction of more than 94,000 uses over that period ‚Äì leading police to attack the findings as selective and out of date.

A first poster has been released for Spencer, the forthcoming film about three days in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, starring Kristen Stewart and directed by Pablo Larra√≠n. The poster comes a week before the biopic is due to premiere at Venice film festival.
The image appears to show Stewart bent double and weeping into a vast white gown, likely to be a version of the ‚ÄúDiaghilev‚Äù gown Diana Spencer wore on occasions such as a visit to the Royal Opera House and the film premiere of The Living Daylights. It was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who also created her wedding dress.

With the disturbing news that the window for evacuations from Afghanistan is closing (UK evacuation from Kabul to end within ‚Äò24 to 36 hours‚Äô, defence sources say, 24 August), all governments should ask themselves: what is the moral response to this deepening crisis?
We urge the British government to go further in helping at-risk Afghans, human rights defenders and women activists, and create safe passages so that people can find sanctuary without resorting to dangerous journeys. We have seen in our parishes the warm response to refugees from Afghanistan and other parts of the world. As a nation, we should not be led by a quota, but by the need and pain before us.

Re your report (Nuclear storage plans for north of England stir up local opposition, 23 August), it is no surprise that ongoing discussions to choose locations for the dumping of nuclear waste are cloaked in secrecy.
Over the last decade, the nuclear power industry has successfully rebranded an appallingly toxic energy industry as ‚Äúzero carbon‚Äù and even ‚Äúclean‚Äù (Zero-carbon electricity outstrips fossil fuels in Britain across 2019, 1 January 2020) by never mentioning the terrible legacy of nuclear waste. Nuclear energy is neither clean nor zero-carbon when you consider its complete fuel cycle, from uranium mining overseas to the energy-intensive production of fuel rods to the management of highly toxic radioactive waste products such as plutonium.

Graham, who was the surprise winner in the three-way contest with 37.7% of the vote, was elected on a manifesto that said ‚Äúwe have tried our political project within Labour ‚Äì it has failed‚Äù. She has said she intends to prioritise workplace organising in her new role.

                    <span>Workplace democracy would allow us to come out of the pandemic with a greater sense of control over the future
With most formal Covid restrictions all but melted away, freedom prevails. Back to the workplace, Tory ministers make demands of our newly liberated workforce: the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, warns young workers that continuing to work from home may risk their careers. Though markedly softer in tone than last summer ‚Äì when ministers demanded, through the press, to ‚ÄúGo back to work or risk losing your job‚Äù ‚Äì the message is clear, at least in England: pubs and bars may be thronged again, but the ancien regime of work must be restored in full.
Yet as wars have disrupted the old ways of doing things, spurring on demands that widespread sacrifice should be rewarded with new rights and freedoms, so it should be with the pandemic. In her successful campaign to become general secretary of Britain‚Äôs largest private sector union, Unite, Sharon Graham said the organisation ‚Äúshould get back to the workplace and deliver what it says on the trade union tin ‚Äì a relentless fight for jobs, pay and conditions‚Äù.

Five weeks before a general election, in which at one point the party was leading in the polls, the one-minute-long commercial is being seen by some critics as a deliberate and last-ditch attempt to appeal to as wide a constituency as possible as it battles for second place against the resurgent Social Democrats.

                    <span>Celebrated artist admired for her paintings of flowers and the first woman to be elected to both the Royal and Royal Scottish academies
In 1994, the year that Damien Hirst made his first vitrined sheep, Away from the Flock, pickled in formaldehyde, the artist Elizabeth Blackadder, who has died aged 89, finished a work called Still Life With Cats. The cats were painted in oil on canvas, joining many others in Blackadder‚Äôs oeuvre, alongside arum lilies, Japanese fans and tins of sweets.
Mere difference of age does not explain the gap between Blackadder‚Äôs art and Hirst‚Äôs. Painters of her own generation ‚Äì Bridget Riley was born in the same year, 1931 ‚Äì worked in a style that was insistently modern. This was not Blackadder‚Äôs way. When she and her husband, the artist John Houston, visited New York in 1969 on the way to paint the Wyoming landscape, they made trips to the Museum of Modern Art to see Picasso and Matisse, not Pollock and Warhol. Modern art institutions returned the compliment: there are only half a dozen or so Blackadders in the Tate, all but one of them lithographs, few ever on show and none more recent than 1963. The British Council Collection holds only two Blackadders, the Arts Council‚Äôs none at all. And yet, there is more to the story than meets the eye.

Every year since 1978 the world‚Äôs central bankers have gathered to chew the fat at Jackson Hole in the Grand Tetons. This year‚Äôs star attraction is the most influential central banker of them all ‚Äì Jerome Powell ‚Äì and financial markets will hang on every word from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Powell won‚Äôt reveal much and for good reason: he doesn‚Äôt have all that much to say. He is worried about inflation but there are also signs the US economy is slowing as coronavirus infection rates rise. The pace of recovery is moderating in the UK, Germany, China and pretty much everywhere else as well. There are shortages of materials and labour. In a world of lockdowns, quarantines and travel restrictions, it is proving harder to sustain a model built around frictionless movement of people, parts and finance. Global supply chains are under pressure.

Candyman, in its first incarnation, stepped daintily out of the mirror in 1992, in writer-director Bernard Rose‚Äôs US-set version of the Clive Barker novella The Forbidden, a parable of English class shame set in a Liverpool housing estate. Rose shifted the locale to Chicago‚Äôs deprived Cabrini-Green projects, switched the racial identity of the demon from white to black and gave filmgoers that inspired premise of exactly how he is summoned by rash unbelievers and giggling teens. Since then, Candyman has spawned sequels, references, memes and gags: such as Handyman ‚Äì say his name five times in the mirror and he shows up three hours later and does a horrific job on your boiler.

                    <span>Vogue, Harper‚Äôs and Elle turn the spotlight on razzle dazzle and bright colours as we emerge from Covid gloom
In an unusual move, the cover of British Vogue features the time the photograph on it was shot: 4.57am. The image, of actor and activist Gemma Chan reclining on a boat on the Thames as the sun rises, is symbolic of a new dawn in this September‚Äôs glossy magazines. The biggest, bulkiest and most important of the year, they signal what can be expected in the industry in the months ahead. This year, though, they herald not just a new season but what can be expected from post-pandemic dressing (even if the pandemic isn‚Äôt yet fully in the rear-view mirror).
From Vogue to Elle and Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, this year‚Äôs offering, which is slimmer on the ground than in recent years, since Marie Claire stopping print in 2019 and Katy Grand exited Love Magazine last year, seem to be on the same page in terms of laying out new sartorial spirit. Now is the time, they say, for sequins and silver and dressing up for parties and going out-out rather than dressing down for sofas. Just as, after the first world war and the 1918 flu pandemic, the 1920s brought flappers and flamboyance, this new dawn is the 21st century‚Äôs own roaring 20s. And the vibe is one of hedonism and creativity after the Covid restrictions caused stasis and the rise of elasticated waists.

                    <span>This year‚Äôs Karlovy Vary saw the premiere of a dizzying single-take drama featuring a potent lead performance from Graham as a chef enduring a nightmarish evening
Philip Barantini serves up a single-take headlong nightmare in this drama set in a restaurant, starring the formidable Stephen Graham as an up-and-coming chef called Andy who is running on pure adrenaline, and maybe something more in that water bottle of his. Without any cuts to darkness or a camera flash, Barantini follows the dizzying continuous action in the kitchens and out in the dining room as the pressure begins to take its toll on everyone. And if it looks a bit like TV sometimes, that could be because cookery shows with stressed-out gobby chefs yelling at people are all over television. One of those shows was actually called Ramsay‚Äôs Boiling Point.
Andy is seen showing up ominously late for work one evening, talking on his mobile, trying to juggle some tricky situation in his disintegrating domestic life. Already, his highly professional support staff are dismayed at his behaviour and how they will be expected to cover up for him, even as he takes it out on members of the team junior to them. His trusted seniors are Carly (Vinette Robinson) and commis chef Freeman (Ray Panthaki). Meanwhile, the front-of-house maitre d‚Äô Beth (Alice Feetham) is far too ready to accommodate off-menu requests from annoying food influencers with big Instagram followings. There are many other plot-flavours in this seething stew, but the biggest nightmare is that Andy‚Äôs former boss, telly celebrity chef Alastair Skye (a fantastically unctuous Jason Flemyng) has chosen tonight of all nights to show up, bringing with him sleek food critic Sara Southworth (Lourdes Faberes); for all Alastair‚Äôs fame he is none too pleased at how well his former protege appears to be doing. Could his appearance be some sort of implied threat?

Gatwick airport is to press ahead with plans to convert its emergency runway for routine use, in a sign that the aviation industry expects demand to rebound in full soon after the coronavirus pandemic.
London‚Äôs second biggest airport will launch a public consultation next month on a scheme to enlarge capacity to a potential 75.5 million passengers a year ‚Äì despite still only serving about a quarter of its pre-Covid traffic in August.

Apple knowingly lets underage users access apps intended for adults, according to an investigation by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), despite having asked for and recorded their dates of birth.
The investigation asserts a disconnect between the information Apple knows about a user, which includes their self-declared age, and the ways it polices age restrictions on its App Store.

It‚Äôs easy to find out when Ian Botham last played cricket, because there is Wisden, but it‚Äôs hard to find out when John Cleese was last funny. Some people think he had some moderately amusing lines in A Fish Called Wanda (1988). There was a period in the 2010s when he had an idiosyncratic vendetta and went around town saying ‚ÄúMichael Palin‚Äôs travel show‚Äù and then yawning, which a small niche found rather tickling.
It would be fair to say it‚Äôs not a recent body of comic work that has recommended Cleese for a Channel 4 show about ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù, any more than it is Botham‚Äôs sporting career that equips him to be the trade envoy to Australia for ‚Äúglobal Britain‚Äù. They have been drafted in for the vibes.

While working from home during the pandemic, many workers have put the time they would have spent travelling to and from the office to good use with more leisurely activities, such as exercising or cooking from scratch. But as more workplaces reopen, many may feel that they are losing that time to the commute.
With this in mind, we would like to hear readers‚Äô advice on how to make the most of the journey. Do you cycle to work instead of a morning run, perhaps? Or do you have a go-to podcast for your longer commute? Let us know using the form below.

Sharon Graham‚Äôs victory to replace Len McCluskey and become the first woman to lead Unite, one of Britain‚Äôs most powerful trade unions, may have come as a surprise to many. But not to those who know her determination and fearlessness.
Some say Graham, 51, was written off because she was a woman. Her refusal to bow to pressure to stand down to make way for a leftwing unity candidate, Steve Turner, who was judged most likely to ensure the defeat of the Keir Starmer-supporting Gerard Coyne, earned her ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù online opprobrium, some of which was unquestionably misogynistic.

The hot, dry and windy weather conditions fueling the huge wildfires that have besieged the western US this summer have increased in frequency over the past 50 years, a new study has found.
Since 1973, global heating has desiccated the west, driving increases in ‚Äúfire weather‚Äù days from the Pacific coast to the Great Plains, according to research by the non-profit Climate Central. It found that the number of fire weather days increased steeply in parts of Texas and in California‚Äôs interior, and that southern Nevada, south-east California and swathes of New Mexico had the highest number of average annual fire weather days ‚Äì with nearly a quarter of the year in some regions being characterized as having elevated risk.

I wanted to believe I was there for the right reasons, namely to help the Afghan people and deter future terror attacks. But the doubts always remained, fuelled by witnessing civilians caught up in exchanges of fire, or seeing eerie ghost towns that had been abandoned after ceaseless violence.
For those who haven‚Äôt served in the army, it‚Äôs easy to assume soldiers are obedient and unquestioning. Yet as long as combat operations directly involve humans, doubt will always be part of the equation. Questioning the moral objectives of our mission was, for me at least, a necessary precursor to participation.

Tully Kearney and Reece Dunn led the way for ParalympicsGB on the first day in the pool in Tokyo, winning silver medals in the women‚Äôs 200m freestyle S5 and men‚Äôs 100m butterfly S14 respectively, after the 18-year-old Toni Shaw had taken bronze in the women‚Äôs 400m freestyle S9.
Both Kearney and Dunn were the fastest qualifiers for their finals and Kearney, the winner of three gold medals at the 2019 world championships, went down to an agonising defeat after leading for all but the final few yards of her first Paralympic final.

Afghanistan withdrawal ‚Äì live updates

The Taliban have captured more than 100 Russian-made helicopters in various states of operability, the head of a Russian state arms exporter has said, but will be largely unable to use them with little access to maintenance crews and spare parts.
As the Taliban overran the Afghan army and took control of large stores of arms and vehicles, it also captured at least 100 Mi-17 Hip helicopters, a Russian-made transport aircraft procured by the US for the Afghan armed forces because it was comparatively cheaper and easier to fly than US-made UH-60 Black Hawks.

In 2011, Sam Fender was, by his own admission, ‚Äúa little stoner‚Äù who had flunked out of his A-Levels in his hometown of North Shields, living with his mother in a flat with black mould on the walls. A decade later, he‚Äôs one of the UK‚Äôs best and most successful singer-songwriters: his 2019 debut album Hypersonic Missiles went to No 1, he won a Brit award, and his knack for writing songs about 21st-century disaffections marked him out from cheerier peers such as Ed Sheeran and George Ezra. His second album Seventeen Going Under, a superb record that channels the sound of Bruce Springsteen and the War on Drugs into an examination of his family, youth and frailty, is out in October.

Four weeks ago the Biden administration officially began implementing the child tax credit in what was hailed by Columbia University as an initiative that could ‚Äúcut child poverty in half in the US‚Äù. Most eligible families have received just one monthly installment so far ‚Äì but for many American parents struggling to make ends meet during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, it has already made a huge difference.
The American Rescue Plan ‚Äì passed in March ‚Äì included expanded credit payments, which increased from $2,000 in 2020 to $3,600 for each child under age six, and $3,000 for children ages six through 17, this year. The funds are distributed in monthly payments of either $250 or $300 for each child.

Coronavirus was ‚Äúweaponised‚Äù by domestic abusers during the pandemic and police forces should remain alert to ‚ÄúCovid blaming‚Äù as an excuse or defence by suspects, a study has found.
The Domestic Homicide Project, established by the National Police Chiefs‚Äô Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, revealed that domestic homicides in England and Wales had not increased dramatically during the pandemic but still remained at about three a week, with 163 recorded in the 12 months to March. This was similar to the previous year‚Äôs figure of 152 and in line with the 15-year average.

Everyone knew that Charlie Watts‚Äôs heart was always in jazz. Even when he grew his hair long and put on hippie garb while the Rolling Stones were going through their Satanic Majesties period, underneath he was still the cool bebopper who could see through the nonsense that surrounded his group and the rampaging egos at its heart.
Wisely, he never let his true musical allegiance show in his playing with the Stones. When they recruited him from Alexis Korner‚Äôs Blues Incorporated in January 1963, not long after he‚Äôd been serving an apprenticeship with trad jazz bands, he listened to the records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin‚Äô Wolf and Muddy Waters in order to absorb the way that master Chicago blues drummers such as Earl Phillips, Fred Below and Elgin Evans kept things simple, soon appreciating that simplicity is often the hardest thing of all to achieve.

                    <span>Australians are very protective of their national cake, and with good reason, but who makes the best?
Lamingtons are one of those things, like Tim Tams and toad racing, that are big in Australia but, despite the best efforts of the residents of Ramsay Street, almost unknown elsewhere. Antipodeans of my acquaintance, however, go into nostalgic raptures at the very mention of these little cakes, a staple of Australia Day celebrations and school bake sales. (One friend claims he ate two a day as a child, so he may well be the only person who‚Äôs ever lost weight by moving to the UK.)
Said to have been named after ‚Äì or, by those less familiar with the culinary skills of your average Victorian aristocrat, invented by ‚Äì a former governor of Queensland, it‚Äôs also been appropriated, not uncontroversially, by New Zealand (food writer Irina Georgescu informs me that the same cake is also very popular among the Swabian community in Romania and Germany). Far be it from me, a mere Pom, to comment on the issue, but I will say that whoever came up with them was a clever little sausage.

Bah made her way through a maze of streets to the meeting point where a car was waiting with two strangers inside. When they took her to the airport, Bah felt her heart beating through her chest. She had not realised until then that she would be leaving her country. Aged 17, she had no belongings and no idea where she was going.

                    <span>By boosting dominant species such as great tits, human-provided food can make life harder for many woodland birds
Feeding birds is hard-wired into our national psyche. The apocryphal Victorian ‚Äútuppence a bag‚Äù for seed for the Trafalgar Square pigeons has morphed into a national pastime, with an estimated 17m households spending ¬£250m a year on more than 150,000 tonnes of bird feed ‚Äì enough to feed the entire breeding population of the 10 most common feeder-using bird species year-round three times over.
The habit has been enthusiastically encouraged by environmental NGOs, which recognise it as a way for people to connect with nature. This was brought into sharp relief during the pandemic, with many of us discovering the joy of attracting birds to our own gardens after losing access to wildlife and wild spaces. So we know that bird-feeding can be good for humans, but what about for birds?

                    <span>Spencer Elden, who appeared at four months old on iconic album design, claims the image is child pornography
Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on one of rock music‚Äôs most iconic album covers ‚Äì Nevermind by Nirvana ‚Äì is suing the band, claiming he was sexually exploited as a child.
In a lawsuit filed in a Californian district court against numerous parties, including the surviving members of the band, Kurt Cobain‚Äôs widow Courtney Love, and the record labels that released or distributed the album in the last three decades, Elden alleges the defendants produced child pornography with the image, which features him swimming naked towards a dollar bill with his genitalia visible.

                    <span>Feline fancies began in the UK in 1871, with proud cat owners grabbing the chance to show off their perfect pets. What is the secret of their enduring appeal?
The air in the sports centre has a base note of urine. A soundtrack of plaintive mewling is interrupted occasionally by the sharp scratch of a hiss. Humans dart around the floor, attending to the whims of their lusciously furred, bouffant companions. Hairbrushes are wielded; coats are teased to 80s volumes. Over the PA system, an announcement is made. ‚ÄúLong-haired kittens are required in ring five!‚Äù
The first cat show took place in Crystal Palace, south-east London, in 1871. I have come to the LondonCats Worldwide (LCWW) 150th anniversary celebration show. Over two days, 200 competitors will converge on the Crystal Palace national sports centre, cat carriers in hand. In six rings along one wall of the show floor, judges will assess each animal for temperament, condition and conformity to the breed standard, before an audience of paying spectators.

                    <span>As the pandemic drives calls for a radical overhaul of the food system, can the president take on the meat giants?
Both the planet and US politics have heated up in tandem over recent decades, but few sectors have stewed in controversy quite like America‚Äôs beef industry. Four super-powered meatpackers control more than 80% of the US beef market, an extraordinary concentration of market power that the Biden administration is not happy about. 
A recent executive action signed by the president aims to increase competition in the beef industry, with the White House noting that, over the past five years, ‚Äúfarmers‚Äô share of the price of beef sales has dropped by more than a quarter ‚Äì from 51.5% to 37.3% ‚Äì while the price of beef has risen‚Äù. 
But how were the big four meatpackers able to capture so much of the US beef processing capacity? They had help.

                    <span>Today the media are looking for scapegoats, but 20 years ago they helped facilitate the disastrous intervention
Everyone is to blame for the catastrophe in Afghanistan, except the people who started it. Yes, Joe Biden screwed up by rushing out so chaotically. Yes, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab failed to make adequate and timely provisions for the evacuation of vulnerable people. But there is a frantic determination in the media to ensure that none of the blame is attached to those who began this open-ended war without realistic aims or an exit plan, then waged it with little concern for the lives and rights of the Afghan people: the then US president, George W Bush, the British prime minister Tony Blair and their entourages.
Indeed, Blair‚Äôs self-exoneration and transfer of blame to Biden last weekend was front-page news, while those who opposed his disastrous war 20 years ago remain cancelled across most of the media. Why? Because to acknowledge the mistakes of the men who prosecuted this war would be to expose the media‚Äôs role in facilitating it.

                    <span>Violence, when it happens, is clumsy and banal. The possibility of a repeat kicking lurked around every corner and the hometown I loved was cast in sinister hues
The first time I was beaten up in the street I was 16 and had intervened when a boy tried to throw a friend of mine through a shop window. The third time, I had my nose broken at 2am in Luton for laughing when three jeering lads called me ‚ÄúJohn Travolta‚Äù (a reference to Grease, presumably; I was going through a big Rocket From The Crypt phase).
But the second time was the most significant. It was 1993, the summer before I failed my A-levels majestically, and two friends, D and M, and I were stumbling home several miles from a Durham nightclub (whose door was run by a young Dominic Cummings) back to our estate outside a north-east town. We were innocent indie kids; we played in punk bands, changed hairstyles regularly and took absolutely nothing seriously save for books, music and high times. We were not fighters. Life was for laughing at.

                    <span>Fashion and beauty expert David Yi has written a book that reveals how prejudice has kept men‚Äôs beauty routines hidden
The history of the male beauty ritual has been largely undocumented ‚Äì and forgotten about ‚Äì due to a combination of gender prejudice and misogyny, according to a new book by David Yi, writer and founder of the gender-inclusive skincare website Very Good Light. ‚ÄúFor centuries, it is as if speaking about a king‚Äôs cosmetics predilections or a famed ruler‚Äôs aesthetics meant they were feminine which meant them being less powerful,‚Äù he says. 
The author of Pretty Boys: Legendary Icons Who Redefined Beauty concludes that history omits the grooming rituals of leaders and rulers in an attempt to put a modern, heteronormative-filter on the past. Yi says: ‚ÄúMany historians are fearful that the men they have studied and revered would be stripped of their dignity, or perhaps even deemed less powerful, if it was discovered that they wore makeup or had a passion for being pretty.‚Äù

Lucy Dawson was skating through life. Everything came so easily to her: she had friends, confidence, academic success. At the age of 20, she was studying criminology at the University of Leicester, determined to join the police. Then, in the summer of 2016, she got a terrible headache that refused to go away.
The headache was to change Dawson‚Äôs life. It took almost four months for her to be diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the brain that leaves many people with permanent brain damage and has a mortality rate of about one in 10. She was showing classic symptoms of encephalitis from the off (confusion, personality change, hallucinations and the headaches) which should have been spotted within a couple of days.

Sophia is the story of Scotland‚Äôs first female doctor and her pioneering campaign against a hostile, all-male medical establishment. It not only draws our eye to forgotten women‚Äôs histories but interrogates the biographical process itself: how a life is presented on paper, who presents it, what is included and what left out.
Playwright Frances Poet nimbly entwines Sophia Jex-Blake‚Äôs groundbreaking battles with the story of her ‚Äúofficial‚Äù biography in this audio play, part of the Sound Stage series by Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh.

Joe Biden has rejected the pleas of domestic and international allies to keep troops in Afghanistan for evacuation efforts beyond the end of the month, citing the growing threat of a terrorist attack.
In a move likely to fuel criticism that America is abandoning Afghan partners to the Taliban, the US president made clear that he is resolved to withdraw forces from Kabul airport by next Tuesday‚Äôs deadline.

In the wake of her breakthrough Wimbledon, this has been the challenge before Emma Raducanu as she has spent the past few weeks travelling around the United States and playing to crowds a fraction of Court One‚Äôs capacity. So far, she has thrived.

Paris Saint-Germain are considering a ‚Ç¨160m (¬£137m) bid from Real Madrid for Kylian Mbapp√©, with the France forward hoping to seal a move to the Spanish giants.
The 22-year-old has less than a year remaining on his contract in the French capital having turned down more than three different proposals from PSG to extend it over recent months. Despite the arrival of Lionel Messi from Barcelona, Mbapp√© has made it clear that he would like to move to La Liga after signing from Monaco on an initial season-long loan in 2017 before joining permanently for ¬£165.7m a year later.

Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies aged 80
A life in pictures
Obituary

By any standards, Charlie Watts was an unlikely candidate for rock stardom.
He was quiet, drily funny and unfailingly modest, characteristics theoretically better suited to his initial profession as a graphic designer than the scream-rent world of 60s pop. Furthermore, by his own admission, he didn‚Äôt particularly care for rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anything about it ‚Ä¶ I used to hate Elvis Presley. Miles Davis ‚Äì that‚Äôs what I considered someone,‚Äù he told an interviewer in 1993) and had initially had to have the rhythm and blues so beloved of his bandmates explained to him: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was. I thought it meant Charlie Parker, played slow‚Äù.

The Premier League, which has backed the clubs‚Äô stance, has also registered its concern at Fifa‚Äôs decision to allow Conmebol teams to play three fixtures in the next two international breaks.

A hefty storm is brewing outside a ramshackle office on the isle of Guernsey, carrying with it stories of ghosts and ghouls. Written by James Milton and Paul Morrissey, with localised stories of whispers in tunnels and faces in forests, When Darkness Falls smartly entwines history and folklore. After a shaky start, this is a show that gets smarter and scarier as the night goes on.
Working for the Guernsey Historical Society, John (Will Barton) has stayed late to record a vlog with a writer and paranormal researcher (Alex Phelps). Looking back on the ghost stories that haunt the ancient island, the writer tells John five stories, testing his lack of belief with tales of witches, apparitions and unresolved revenge.

In a development that suggests recovery from the pandemic could be at risk, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said stock levels in relation to expected sales fell to their lowest level in August since it began tracking retail industry trends almost four decades ago.

Ofgem‚Äôs price cap will climb to its highest level since it was introduced in early 2019 owing to a surge in global gas market prices. The regulator said that for 11 million households who pay by direct debit, energy bills would increase from an average of ¬£1,138 a year to ¬£1,277 from October.

                    <span>Ordinary Afghans will pay the highest price for the west‚Äôs defeated ambitions
It speaks volumes about the world today that a US president was more worried about the Taliban looking weak than about his western allies. Britain, France and Germany asked Joe Biden to continue evacuating civilians from Kabul past his self-imposed deadline of 31 August. But the US rejected these requests. Mr Biden wanted to end the chaotic TV scenes from Afghanistan that hurt his domestic poll ratings. But he also accepted that Kabul‚Äôs new rulers could not afford to look weak in front of their rival Isis, which is looking for an opportunity to embarrass its Taliban peer.
The west‚Äôs airlift will therefore be over by next Tuesday. It is the Afghan people who will pay the highest price for the west‚Äôs defeated ambitions for their country. They now face living under Taliban rule for a second time. There is no guarantee that a grinding civil war is over. The scale of the west‚Äôs failure is not just that the world‚Äôs biggest economies will almost certainly fail to evacuate all those who were employed by its armies and diplomats. It is that we have let down a generation of urban Afghans, especially women, who grew up believing that their lives would be better than their parents‚Äô.

Ukraine‚Äôs president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, could be forgiven for cursing his luck as the country celebrates the 30th anniversary of its independence from the former Soviet Union. On Tuesday, Mr Zelenskiy presided over a military parade in Kiev, attended by an impressive array of dignitaries and heads of state. But in a week when he hoped to concentrate the minds of western allies on Russian bullying and intransigence, their focus is firmly on Afghanistan.
The struggle to stay on the diplomatic radar has become a familiar one. On Monday, Ukraine held an attention-seeking summit on Crimea, illegally annexed by Vladimir Putin in March 2014. The European Union, with which Ukraine signed an association agreement months later, imposed sanctions, and refuses to recognise the territory as part of Russia. At the summit, the European council president, Charles Michel, promised that the EU would continue to ‚Äústand tall‚Äù against such violations of international law. But in truth, the Russian annexation is a fait accompli that no one now expects to be reversed. Sending late apologies, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel failed to appear at the event.

The Edinburgh festival fringe has launched a ¬£7.5m emergency appeal after it lost millions of pounds during the Covid pandemic.
The festival‚Äôs directors said the crisis had had a devastating impact on the event, which until last year was the world‚Äôs largest annual arts festival. It was entirely shut down in 2020 and this year has operated at a fifth of its normal size.

Simon Akam is right, the military does want to ignore its failure in Afghanistan (Britain‚Äôs military will want to ignore its failure in Afghanistan. It must face reality, 22 August), but it does so by deflecting responsibility on to the politicians.
There is also a strong reluctance to publish books and articles that are critical of the military, even by those who served. All three books cited by Akam are by journalists who are ex-military.

In Italy, mandatory Covid tests required for travel have a fixed price of ‚Ç¨15 set by the government, with a result provided within 20 minutes (Cowboy‚Äô providers could lose approval to sell PCR travel tests, 23 August). This is a sensible and fair approach that is helping lead the tide of optimism in Italy. Perhaps it has something to do with the country‚Äôs health minister being so appropriately named Bob Hope (Roberto Speranza).

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúResearch ‚Ä¶ does not suggest a direct correlation between the rises in gun sales and violence‚Äù (Editorial, 22 August). I don‚Äôt think I have ever read anything so ridiculous.

Arteta‚Äôs side face trips to West Brom and Manchester City

Mikel Arteta has admitted turning Arsenal‚Äôs fortunes around will ‚Äútake some time‚Äù and urged supporters to get behind the team when they travel to West Brom in the Carabao Cup tonight before facing Manchester City on Saturday.
The 2-0 home defeat against Chelsea on Sunday left Arsenal without a point or goal from their opening two Premier League matches to increase the pressure on Arteta after failing to qualify for European competition last season. That meant Arsenal enter the League Cup at the second-round stage for the first time since 1995.

Britain was not expelled from the European Union, although some of the dismay at the consequences of Brexit would make more sense in that scenario. Customs checks at the border are likened to a blockade. Rules that apply to all non-EU countries are described as punishment beatings. The expectation that Boris Johnson uphold the treaty he signed is cast as unreasonable spite.
This is all consistent with the sacred rule of English Euroscepticism, according to which ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù must always be understood in terms of things done to us by them; never things we do to ourselves.

A pink neon sign glows beneath a light-studded ceiling in the new entrance lobby of the National Youth Theatre, bringing a touch of Broadway glamour to the Holloway Road.

‚ÄúEven one of the local councillors didn‚Äôt know we were here,‚Äù says the NYT‚Äôs artistic director, Paul Roseby. ‚ÄúOur sign was hidden behind the trees, the front door was always closed and people were shuffled in through a side entrance into a miserable lift lobby.

After a ¬£4m makeover, led by architects DSDHA, it‚Äôs now impossible to miss it. Clad in glossy green glazed bricks, oozing the jovial civic air of a Victorian pub, the new structure houses a community studio right on the street, with big shop windows giving passersby a glimpse of the action inside. ‚ÄúAll we‚Äôre missing is a Hollywood-style Walk of Fame,‚Äù says Roseby. ‚ÄúOne day I hope we‚Äôll have stars in the pavement between here and the Odeon.‚Äù

                    <span>‚ÄòAlarming‚Äô drop in workers signing up, with many put off by requirement to be fully vaccinated against Covid by 11 November

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

An army of volunteers could be needed this winter to tackle rising staff shortages in care homes fuelled by the looming requirement for all care home workers to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, providers have said.
As the health secretary, Sajid Javid, urged care workers to book their jabs in time to meet the 11 November deadline for all staff in registered care homes in England to be fully vaccinated, the Independent Care Group said operators could be forced to hand back contracts to councils or close care homes and relocate residents because of a staffing crisis, exacerbated by ongoing vaccine hesitancy among a minority of staff. It is leading calls for retired nurses, doctors, carers, to be trained and DBS-checked to fill vacancies in case of a feared ‚Äúwinter meltdown‚Äù in staff numbers.

A series of murders in Marseille has sparked a political row over the growing turf wars between drug gangs who are terrorising poor housing estates, where one recent shooting victim was only 14 years old.
Dominique Laurens, the public prosecutor in Marseille, warned this week that France‚Äôs second-biggest city was facing ‚Äúa very difficult moment‚Äù as she detailed an explosion in violence and score-settling killings that were defined by ‚Äúextreme cruelty and a complete lack of humanity‚Äù.

The location for the Paralympics opening ceremony, at least in the imagination, was that of the Para Airport. After all the dispiriting pandemic processes every athlete has been forced to endure after getting off the plane in Japan, they might not have welcomed the reminder, but there you are.
It was a different kind of airport though, one of sweeping colour, soft purples and greens, one awash with music and a place which gave flight to themes of creativity, endeavour and possibility. It also had 380 volunteers dressed in hats with big purple propellers on them, and you don‚Äôt get that at London Luton.

                    <span>Inspired by a Guardian article, the theatre‚Äôs surreal and spellbinding show AI is a collaboration between humans and the system GPT-3
Last autumn, a deep-learning computer programme wrote an essay for the Guardian. The GPT-3 system argued that humans had nothing to fear from robots. Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, read it and felt inspired. Could there be a future in creative collaboration between AI and humans? If AI could write an article, could it create a play too, in real time, before an audience?
The Young Vic‚Äôs new show, AI, explores these questions, casting the same technology as its virtual star. The production is not so much a piece of theatre as dramaturgy, rehearsal and workshop all in one, and contains its own riveting meta drama: a play is constructed over multiple evenings, culminating in a short show that combines human direction and performance with machine imagination and stagecraft (the use of algorithms to create its soundtrack, for example).

Social media platforms were buzzing on Monday after a post emerged that appeared to show the trailer for Marvel‚Äôs much-anticipated Spider-Man: No Way Home. Despite the poor quality of the clip, which seems to be filming a phone playing the watermarked trailer, fans across the world squinted at the footage to ascertain what lies ahead for Tom Holland‚Äôs Peter Parker as he appeared to encounter Doctor Strange, and some faces from the past. It was catnip for Spidey followers, who had become frustrated with the lack of promotional material for a film that is less than four months from cinemas. It has also been the subject of furious speculation, as Marvel‚Äôs multiverse arc opens the possibility of several Spider-men crossing paths.

The Paralympics begins this week, and we‚Äôre about to see some fantastic sport, from Ellie Simmonds in the pool to Sarah Storey in the velodrome. But, unfortunately, we‚Äôre also about to hear lots of cringe-worthy takes on disability.
The most jarring opinion I have repeatedly come across online is the idea, rooted in the ‚Äúdisabled shirker‚Äù narrative, that Paralympic athletes represent what all disabled people could achieve if they just applied themselves. If Hannah Cockroft can wheel 100m in 17.42 seconds, then surely the rest of us can at least make our way to a job interview?

                    <span>Hasan Piker, a leftwing commentator with a huge online following, has attracted criticism after buying an expensive new home. But shouldn‚Äôt the left be concentrating on other things, such as getting into power?
Hasan Piker, AKA Hasan the Hun, AKA ‚Äúwoke bae‚Äù, has bought a house. If you‚Äôre extremely online then you‚Äôll know exactly what this means and already have a strong opinion about it. If you are a normal, well-adjusted, human being then you will have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. So, in brief: Piker is a 30-year-old dude who has gained a massive following through leftwing political commentary on the streaming service Twitch. Spending several hours a day ranting about politics on the internet hasn‚Äôt just earned him more than a million followers, it‚Äôs also made him a lot of money: Piker has just bought a $2.7m (¬£1.9m) house with a swimming pool in West Hollywood. Cue screams of ‚Äúclass traitor‚Äù and ‚Äúhypocrite!‚Äù
Piker‚Äôs new pad has drawn a lot of criticism from fans who think he has betrayed his socialist values. It has also drawn predictable ire from the rightwing media, who have used the story to try to prove socialists don‚Äôt have any values. There is nothing conservatives love more than an opportunity to write a story along the lines of ‚ÄúFRAUD: self-proclaimed socialist buys something!‚Äù They seem to think that you can‚Äôt possibly critique capitalism if you own any sort of property. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example has been criticised by rightwing commentators for owning a nice jacket and a Tesla; Bernie Sanders has been slammed for owning three houses; Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter and self-described Marxist, has been dubbed a hypocrite for buying multiple houses.

What‚Äôs the secret to great Spanish cooking?
Neil, Richmond
To read a list of Spanish pantry staples is to feel instantly hungry. Extra-virgin olive oil, salt and sherry vinegar, as Andalusian master chef Dani Garc√≠a of Bibo in London points out, make an excellent gazpacho dressing, and are also the foundational trio of Spanish cuisine. To these, add aromatics: white onion (for sweetness), lots of garlic, piment√≥n (smoked paprika) and saffron, the latter both in moderation.

                    <span>Musically-minded villain doesn‚Äôt really make this a feminist film, or bring much coherence to the mayhem she orchestrates
Another entry to chalk up in the neo-giallo wave currently being led by Prano Bailey-Bond‚Äôs Censor, this also flips the misogynistic precepts of the genre ‚Äì in this case making the murderous point of view very much female. Kamia Benge plays music student Alexis, a young deaf girl who is far from being traumatised by an incident of terrible violence in her home, and instead finds that a meat tenderiser‚Äôs squelchy impact causes her to see a constellation of hallucinogenic lights ‚Äì along presumably all the feels.
Years later, her hearing returned, Alexis (now played by Jasmin Savoy Brown) and fellow student Marie (Lili Simmons) are recording in an S&amp;M dungeon when the flesh-strikes start tickling her dormant synaesthesia ‚Äì and she tries pushing the gimp beyond his limits. Out walking one night on a break from her music, Alexis shoves a street harasser in front of an SUV ‚Äì causing a full-on multi-coloured synaptic big bang. Sensing the possibilities, this uncompromising avant-gardist decides to take her musically motivated pain infliction much further, giving new meaning to the term sick beats.

Rishi Sunak‚Äôs approval ratings tell their own story. The chancellor‚Äôs stock is high, because the Treasury‚Äôs furlough scheme has limited the job losses from the pandemic. But while Sunak has had a much better crisis than some of his colleagues, his record is far from flawless.
Two errors of judgment stick out: the ‚Äúeat out to help out‚Äù discounts for diners, blamed for a wave of infections last autumn, and the decision to raise the threshold on stamp duty for home purchases in England and Northern Ireland from ¬£125,000 to ¬£500,000.

                    <span>Beefy At Davos is an episode of long-running sitcom The United Kingdom that we‚Äôd all like to watch
I am disappointed to note that a certain mirth has attended the news that Beefy Botham has been made a UK trade envoy. There seems to be some sense that his lordship is not up to the job, despite being a former cricketer with his own wine range, and despite the position of trade envoy being one that even Prince Andrew could manage for many years.
Not that Beefy has stepped directly into Andrew‚Äôs sweat-free shoes ‚Äì Lord Botham‚Äôs appointment is Australia-specific, announced on Monday by pitilessly bubbly trade secretary Liz Truss. As she put it, ‚ÄúIan will bat for business Down Under‚Äù ‚Äì a statement that underscored the fact that if cliches were trade, Liz would be running a huge surplus. Alas, not everyone is as meaninglessly upbeat as her. (They couldn‚Äôt be: it requires suspending all critical faculties in the service of positioning oneself as the sort of glass-half-full person who would make a nice badminton partner or chancellor of the exchequer to a man who can‚Äôt bear bad news.)

‚ÄúOur catchphrase was, ‚ÄòWhat are they going to do, sack us?‚Äô‚Äù says Adam Hills. ‚ÄúWe were only meant to be on air for 10 days, so we were happy to push boundaries. Little did we suspect we‚Äôd still be here nine years later.‚Äù

                    <span>Online communities are not just used for propaganda but are valuable fundraising tools and crucial to recruitment
The Taliban took over Afghanistan in two weeks, ending 20 years of fighting with western troops and the Afghan national army. Many factors, such as a problematic peace deal, a lack of political will among the former Kabul administration to fight the Taliban and rampant corruption contributed to the group‚Äôs rapid advance and the fall of Kabul ‚Äì but notable among them was a successful modern media strategy.
Prior to 2001 the Taliban banned the use of the internet, dismantled state-run television stations, ordered citizens to stop watching TV altogether and banned music. But after they had been ousted by international forces, the group rapidly expanded its online presence, starting in 2003 with a new insurgency. They launched a new radio station called Voice of Sharia, which had its own website, Al Emarah. Despite numerous attempts to block and remove it, Al Emarah has remained the official website of the Taliban. The site primarily contains battlefield news and videos, as well as the Taliban‚Äôs official statements. In the aftermath of their defeat, the Taliban focused their efforts on reviving the group online, ‚Äúa virtual emirate‚Äù, as one scholar called it.

After watching Pedro Almod√≥var‚Äôs Broken Embraces, which draws heavily on the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, I was determined to visit. A Google image search of the island made my head fizz: black sand beaches, alien-green ponds, mountains, great pyramids of ochre dirt and dead lava. In the summer of 2016, I finally booked a solo hiking trip there to mark the completion of my first book, Anxiety for Beginners. It was breathtaking, in all kinds of ways.
In the excitement of having written a book, the difficult experiences I had reflected upon in my childhood and teen years (a near-fatal illness and quite a difficult home life) had begun to feel a little academic ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt connecting to the person I had talked about on the page. I realised it wasn‚Äôt just the content of the book I had needed to process, but where I was in my life.

As if first dates aren‚Äôt awkward enough, along comes video dating to add an extra layer of tech frustration and misinterpreted body language to the mix. During lockdown, video calls ‚Äì either within a dating app, or on platforms such as Zoom ‚Äì took off. But as restrictions lift, many dating experts predict the format is here to stay ‚Äì or at least that it has become a helpful additional step. Dating apps rolled out video call functions last year, and Hinge found that 65% of people who had been on a virtual date planned to continue post-pandemic. Of Tinder‚Äôs younger users (Generation Z daters, in their late teens and early 20s), half have used video dating. So you may as well perfect your on-screen hairstyle, decide what to wear on your upper half and embrace it. Here are some tips on how to succeed.

In 2010, the One Million Trees initiative was announced by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai. The aim of the launch was to increase green areas in Dubai through afforestation, while contributing to overall beautification of the city.

During months of lockdown, homeworking and homeschooling, many families have relied on screens to teach and entertain their children during the pandemic.
We‚Äôre interested to hear from parents about their children‚Äôs screen time: Has the time your child spends in front of screens increased since the pandemic began, and if so, how do you feel about it?

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

It may be difficult to unpack, but shoppers could soon find the no-frills minimalism of Ikea has been lent a little glam-rock flair thanks to one of Britain‚Äôs most famous fashion designers.
Dame Zandra Rhodes has announced she had designed a line of homeware products for the Swedish furniture chain, a decision she made after painting her Billy bookcase ‚Äúan iridescent Frida Kahlo blue‚Äù.

                    <span>The San Onofre nuclear power plant shut down years ago ‚Äì but residents and experts worry what will happen with the waste left behind
More than 2 million visitors flock each year to California‚Äôs San Onofre state beach, a dreamy slice of coastline just north of San Diego. The beach is popular with surfers, lies across one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the Unites States and has a 10,000-year-old sacred Native American site nearby. It even landed a shout-out in the Beach Boys‚Äô 1963 classic Surfin‚Äô USA.
But for all the good vibes and stellar sunsets, beneath the surface hides a potential threat: 3.6m lb of nuclear waste from a group of nuclear reactors shut down nearly a decade ago. Decades of political gridlock have left it indefinitely stranded, susceptible to threats including corrosion, earthquakes and sea level rise.

The mobile phones of nine Bahraini activists, including two who were granted asylum protection and are now living in London, were hacked between June 2020 and February 2021 using NSO Group spyware, according to new findings by researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.
A report due to be released on Tuesday will reveal that the hacked activists, some of whose phones were being monitored by Citizen Lab researchers at the time they were hacked, include three members of Waad, a secular leftwing political group that was suspended in 2017 amid a crackdown on peaceful dissent in Bahrain.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

British tourists face difficulties in proving their vaccine status in Europe following a delay in linking the NHS Covid pass to the EU‚Äôs system due to gaps in the British government‚Äôs application to Brussels.
An IT tie-up would ensure automatic recognition across the 27 member states of the information held on the NHS app, facilitating both international travel and access to hospitality where proof of vaccine status is required.

In recent years, Love Island has become as ingrained in the British calendar as April showers in spring, and that sludgy stuff that appears in the road when cars drive over fallen leaves in autumn. Love Island is summer, summer is Love Island and ‚Äì as all seasonal phenomena must ‚Äì it drew to a close last night. Deflate your novelty doughnut-shaped rubber ring; hang your bikini over a chair to finally dry.
The thing about events that come around every year, however, is that while they‚Äôre sometimes comforting, they can also be boring. Last night, denied of the banter outcome (that is, a win by Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran, a couple with the delightful, fizzy energy of two Beroccas dissolving in the same glass), we instead looked on politely as Liam Reardon and Millie Court were crowned the winners of Love Island 2021, the prosaic prom king and queen of the villa.

                    <span>Covid and the boom in streaming platforms are being touted as a huge threat to cinema-going. But so was telly. And surely we‚Äôre all desperate to leave the house and make a big social occasion of it all?
So are we in or out? Is this going to be the old normal or some new normal that the business still hasn‚Äôt yet grasped? As we look forward to what‚Äôs on offer in cinemas this autumn, we see new films mixed in with a deja-vu raft of old product delayed from the distant ‚Äúbefore times‚Äù of pre-Covid. These films are beginning to feel like pizzas removed from the freezer cabinet, thawed out, and then unhygienically put back in the freezer. And of course we are all still absorbing the fact that Covid conforms neither to the accepted news cycles or movie distribution release structures. There could still be a fourth or a fifth wave. Cinemas could still be shut down again.
Covid might have changed the movie world temporarily or permanently or not at all, but as we fret fruitlessly about the discomfort of wearing masks in cinemas, the revolution could have already arrived in the new economy of streaming ‚Äì which had been changing the game anyway.

Margie remains completely still. Around her in the sun-dappled woods, six dogs catch her scent and begin to circle. She pulls her head and legs inside her shell and hinges it shut, tight as a trap, but the dogs are clearly professionals.
Ruger, a one and a half year old Boykin spaniel, prevails. He clamps his jaws around Margie‚Äôs shell and carries the 25-year-old eastern box turtle like a trophy to the feet of turtle tracker John Rucker.

This law follows earlier restrictions by Viktor Orb√°n&#x27;s government on trans rights and adoption by gay parents. Patrik and Zsolt think gay people are the latest scapegoats for the governing Fidesz party, but Budapest&#x27;s Pride parade is an opportunity to protest against the new laws and to rally support.

Mani*, 21, began dating Noor*, 17, two years ago. They couldn‚Äôt see each other during the Covid lockdowns, but when restrictions began to ease, they would meet on the deserted banks of a canal in a small town in Tamil Nadu. The couple hoped to marry one day, but then Noor fell pregnant, and life turned into a nightmare.
Two months ago, Mani was charged with rape under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) law. After 48 days in jail, he was released on bail. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment.

Planting trees without plastic tree guards should be standard practice, a UK study has found, as leading conservation charities and landowners seek sustainable alternatives to reduce plastic waste.
The Woodland Trust has announced it is aiming to stop using plastic tree guards by the end of the year. It is trialling plastic-free options at its Avoncliff site in Wiltshire, including cardboard and British wool. The charity plans to plant 10 million trees each year until 2025.

                    <span>I fell hard for life in the Vosges in France. But when it got dark I couldn‚Äôt helped being spooked by every rustle, bark and footstep I heard. Then a night drinking outside changed everything
Eighteen-and-a-bit years ago, pushing 40, tired of England and keen to spend more time with my daughter, who was growing up in France, I packed in my job, left London and moved to the Vosges mountains in the east of the country. It was an idyllic spot: a little stark, vaguely unkempt, full of dark forests, crystalline lakes and gnarled locals with chainsaws in their sheds and bulldozers in their gardens. When they weren‚Äôt turning trees into firewood, they were digging out ponds ‚Äì or possibly graves. In the second world war, they told me, there had been a murder near my home; the killer had buried his victim in a cabbage patch. But I digress.
Home was a draughty stone shack a couple of miles from the nearest village, down a dirt track flanked by spruces and silver birch. My nearest neighbour was a three-minute walk away, and when the birches were in leaf you couldn‚Äôt see another house. Indoors, I was plagued by dormice, and a shrew once dropped from the bedroom ceiling. Outside, there were red squirrels, buzzards and small animals that ran and squeaked in the undergrowth all day long. Sometimes I would open my front door to find a doe and her fawns cropping the lawn. I fell hard and fast for the Vosges.

                    <span>Trans children and their families still often face suspicion and suppression, but attitudes are changing
‚ÄòMy preconceptions about trans people came from the media, and I certainly hadn‚Äôt heard of trans children. So it just flummoxed me having an assigned male child who didn‚Äôt have especially ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô interests and yet was saying consistently, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a girl.‚Äô‚Äù
Kate was telling me about her eldest daughter, Alex. (Names of all trans young people, and of their parents, have been changed for their privacy.) It was a warm July evening, and we were sitting in the kitchen of their family home, in a comfortable British suburb populated by middle-class couples with young families. Alex, still at primary school, is trans. A few years ago, her mum assumed she was a boy who was clumsily trying to ask for typically feminine things. ‚ÄúI remember I used to have conversations with her at a very young age in the car because she‚Äôd get really upset. I‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòBut I don‚Äôt understand what would be different if you were a girl? What can‚Äôt you do that you could do if you were a girl?‚Äô I‚Äôd ask: ‚ÄòDo you want a doll?‚Äô She‚Äôd just reply: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like dolls!‚Äô‚Äù

Its sturdy presence has threaded through more than 2,000 years of history, fuelled by fans that were said to have ranged from the Carthaginian general Hannibal to Roman legions.
These days, however, the longstanding tradition of swordmaking in the Spanish city of Toledo has dwindled to just two artisan swordmakers ‚Äì the last living link to a tradition that stretches back millennia.

Another accuser took the witness stand on Monday at R Kelly‚Äôs sex-trafficking trial, testifying that the R&amp;B superstar had sexually abused her on his tour bus and in hotel rooms when she was still a high school student and an aspiring singer.
The woman, identified only as ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù, said Kelly had once beaten her with a shoe and wept when she also claimed that she had contracted herpes after having sex with him. She said he hadn‚Äôt disclosed he had a sexually transmitted disease.

The record-shattering rainfall that caused deadly flooding across Germany and Belgium in July was made up to nine times more likely by the climate crisis, according to research.
The study also showed that human-caused global heating has made downpours in the region up to 20% heavier. The work reinforces the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs landmark report this month that there is ‚Äúunequivocal‚Äù evidence that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause of worsening extreme weather.

The leader of the Proud Boys extremist group was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn down from a historic Black church and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the nation‚Äôs capital days before the 6 January Capitol attack.
Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.

                    <span>The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami is a story that didn‚Äôt need to be overdramatised. But Channel 5 appear to have missed the memo with this formulaic, melodramatic mess
The colossal scale of the Boxing Day tsunami ‚Äì a 9.1 magnitude earthquake under the Indian Ocean displacing 30tn litres of seawater that hit the coasts of mainland Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India in waves that rushed at 500mph ‚Äì would compel even if it were not for the human catastrophe that accompanied its incomparably destructive force. A quarter of a million people were killed. Entire towns and communities were wiped out. Survivors‚Äô stories are uniformly harrowing.
There have been a number of dramas ‚Äì most notably the Abi Morgan-scripted miniseries Tsunami, the Aftermath in 2006 ‚Äì but Channel 5‚Äôs three-part film, following the minute-by-minute progression of the tsunami from the moment the two tectonic plates 19 miles under the sea finally ruptured at 7.58am on 26 December 2004, is one of only a few documentaries about it. Dr Xand van Tulleken presents the main thrust of the story ‚Äì travelling to the affected areas as he outlines the terrifying phenomenon‚Äôs journey and interviewing those who were caught up in it. Raksha Dave visits scientists who explain the facts behind the waves‚Äô emergence, evolution and effects.

‚ÄúAny athlete you talk to, they have resilience,‚Äù said Shahrad Nasajpour during a press briefing in Tokyo on Monday. ‚ÄúPart of it comes from the athletic background, so any athlete you talk to they have it. But when you are a refugee athlete or Paralympian, which makes it even harder, the adversity behind makes you more perseverant in your life and in your career.‚Äù
Nasajpour, who has cerebral palsy, left his native Iran in 2015 and was granted asylum in the US. He was instrumental in setting up the Paralympic refugee team which competed for the first time in Rio in 2016, and indeed formed 50% of its number. Now, as part of a six-strong team, he will be competing in the F37 discus once again and when the Games get under way in Japan on Tuesday the resilience, perseverance and athletic talent that Nasajpour represents will be the qualities organisers hope to project to a watching world.

Don‚Äôt expect the shock of the new from the BBC Radio 4 stalwart, but audience suggestions and music really lift the second half
Is it a live show ‚Äì or an impersonation of a live show? BBC Radio 4 favourite Dead Ringers takes up residency at the London Wonderground, with a compendium of sketches to tickle their fans. Many have already been broadcast; all are recited script-in-hand. Within those parameters, Duncan Wisbey, Debra Stephenson and Jon Culshaw deliver a likable hour of mimicry, in which the voices are always enjoyable, even when the jokes are uninspired.
Of course, we don‚Äôt expect the shock of the new from this 20-year-old institution. If we did, Culshaw‚Äôs dress sense ‚Äì he‚Äôs wearing a smoking jacket ‚Äì would soon disabuse us. Give or take a barbed remark from Wisbey, this is genteel satire-lite that couldn‚Äôt be more ‚ÄúRadio 4 comedy‚Äù (unreflective, a little pleased with itself, blandly non-partisan) if it tried. The opening stages, parodying the Today programme, are full of predictable news-based gags, making sport of sex-mad Johnson, abnormal Gove and policy-free Starmer. Elsewhere, there‚Äôs an off-putting fixation on the idea that Andy Murray is dominated by his mum.

Tributes to those who have died in the recent wave included some from the family and friends of Samantha Willis, 35, a mother of four from Derry who contracted Covid-19 while heavily pregnant and died 16 days later after having given birth to her daughter Evie Grace.

The video, taken on Fregate Island in July 2020, shows a female giant tortoise slowly stalking a lesser noddy tern chick, snapping at it unsuccessfully before delivering a lethal bow by clamping its jaws directly around its head.

Body says it is a ‚Äòretention tool for key senior leaders‚Äô

Tom Harrison and a group of senior executives at the England and Wales Cricket Board are poised to share a projected ¬£2.1m bonus pot despite making 62 job cuts last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The most recent ECB accounts show that a five-year Long-Term Incentive Plan is due to be settled in cash in 2022, with the Guardian having learned that Harrison, the board‚Äôs chief executive who was paid ¬£512,000 last year despite a voluntary pay cut, and Sanjay Patel, managing director of the Hundred, are among its intended recipients.

‚Ä¢ Actors told they‚Äôre ‚Äòtoo disabled‚Äô for disabled roles in UK television
I had mixed feelings on being offered the MacTaggart lecture this year. The first was surprise: had anyone ever heard me speak? I once did a Bafta speech that Piers Morgan described on Twitter as the worst in the history of the awards. The second was disbelief that I had been afforded such an honour. The third was a sense of extreme responsibility. I knew it was an opportunity to talk about disability ‚Äì or the lack of disability ‚Äì on TV, how television gets key discussions wrong, and how I might dare represent that cause.
The issue of representation has reared its head in the past 10 years in particular. I am not going to use the word diversity because I don‚Äôt love the word. Diversity feels celebratory: ‚ÄúLook how diverse we are, aren‚Äôt we wonderful.‚Äù Representation implies a responsibility. If TV is not representative then it fails. And when it comes to disability, the failure is really stark.

‚Ä¢ Jack Thorne: why it‚Äôs time to end TV‚Äôs deplorable prejudice against disabled people
Actors have been told they are ‚Äútoo disabled‚Äù to play disabled roles in popular television series, with parts instead going to able-bodied people, according to a leading screenwriter who has called for television companies to adopt quotas for people with disabilities.
Jack Thorne said funding for shows featuring disabled characters is difficult to obtain, disabled writers are regularly unable to attend script meetings because production offices are inaccessible, and recalled the time a friend who uses a wheelchair was forced to crawl along a muddy floor to reach her desk while working on a film shoot.

Ending lockdowns and other public health restrictions once 80% of the adult population is vaccinated could result in 25,000 deaths in total and 270,000 cases of long Covid, new modelling warns.
The work by researchers at three leading Australian universities predicts more than 10 times as many deaths as the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins the national four-phase roadmap. That plan was adopted by national cabinet in July but is subject to different interpretations by state and territory leaders.

                    <span>Lack of planning and coordination has left the west scrambling to do the right thing
At the weekend, in advance of Tuesday‚Äôs crisis meeting of G7 leaders, Boris Johnson tweeted that it was vital for the international community to work together to ‚Äúensure safe evacuations, prevent a humanitarian crisis and support the Afghan people to secure the gains of the last 20 years‚Äù. Had this exhortation been made at June‚Äôs G7 summit in Cornwall ‚Äì when America‚Äôs intention to pull out of Afghanistan at reckless speed was already known ‚Äì it would have been a little more impressive and meaningful.
Delivered belatedly against a backdrop of lethal chaos and confusion at Kabul airport, the prime minister‚Äôs words serve only to underline how little planning and coordination took place when both were urgently required. As a result of Joe Biden‚Äôs precipitate haste to get the withdrawal over and done with, and the negligent response of allies such as Britain, a humanitarian crisis is already in train. For tens of thousands of justifiably terrified Afghanis, the evacuation process is a dangerous lottery that represents a betrayal of the trust they placed in the west. The ‚Äúgains of the last 20 years‚Äù, such as greater freedoms for women and girls, will now be subject to the internal politics of the Taliban, as it decides which face it wishes to present to the world.

                    <span>The liberalisation of betting has had some damaging effects and the industry should stop denying it
New Labour liberalised gambling in Britain with the 2005 Gambling Act, which introduced one of the most permissive regulatory frameworks in the world. The idea was that more betting would deliver economic benefits, and in one sense it did. The gross take from gambling has nearly doubled, with punters losing ¬£10.2bn a year. The industry‚Äôs marketing spend has boomed. And HM Revenue and Customs has gained too: Denise Coates, who runs the Stoke-based gambling giant Bet365, paid ¬£573m in taxes in 2019-20 ‚Äì over ¬£100m more than anyone else.
But along with the increase in gambling came rises in the harms associated with it. When the legislation was passed, concerns were focused on supercasinos. But what happened, instead of the creation of giant hubs, is that gambling (like so much else) moved online and to smartphones, where in-play betting during the course of a football match or other event became one of the most popular ways to bet. The other big change was the spread of fixed-odds betting terminals, from which gambling companies earned huge amounts: ¬£1.8bn in profits each year until the maximum stake was slashed from ¬£100 to ¬£2 in 2020, following a public outcry and the high-profile resignation of a Conservative minister, Tracey Crouch.

The seven-day average for deaths within 28 days of a positive test now stands at 100, figures released by Public Health England on Monday show, a number that was last exceeded on 18 March.

The north-east port town of Hartlepool is one of the sites in the frame as a potential site for a geological disposal facility (GDF), while a former gas terminal point at Theddlethorpe, near the Lincolnshire coast, is another. Cumbria, where much of the waste is stored above ground, is also being considered.

Despite a commitment from the Foreign Office on Friday that visas would be given to all the Afghan security staff contracted through the international security firm GardaWorld to protect the embassy, the guards have still been given no information about if and how they may be helped to leave the country.

It was a baking hot day at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi, and for the observing media the only available shade was next to a small marquee ‚Äì really, just a glorified tent ‚Äì that had been erected for the batsmen to pad up and the bowlers to take a breather.

                    <span>Analysis: Tuesday‚Äôs meeting called by Boris Johnson may include postmortem on Joe Biden‚Äôs handling of crisis
The emergency meeting of G7 nations on Tuesday ‚Äì called by Boris Johnson as this year‚Äôs chair of the G7 ‚Äì is in essence a gathering of the vanquished but faces a threefold agenda: how to ensure as many Afghans as possible can leave Kabul, and whether the US is prepared to stay beyond the original 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of all US forces; how a resettlement programme can be coordinated for the medium term; and finally, how to encourage the Taliban to form an inclusive government, including by threatening sanctions or withholding recognition.
But each country will bring its own concerns and an ugly postmortem on Joe Biden‚Äôs handling of the crisis cannot be ruled out.

                    <span>Readers respond to Alexei Navalny‚Äôs message from prison on steps that the west can take to tackle corrupt regimes
Alexei Navalny rightly asks: ‚ÄúIf corruption is preventing us from finding solutions to the problems of the ‚Äòbig agenda‚Äô, has the time perhaps come to raise it to a priority on that agenda?‚Äù (Only action against corruption can solve the world‚Äôs biggest problems, 19 August).
In respect of the UK, this seems unlikely to happen because corruption ‚Äì ‚Äúthe exploitation of an official position for personal gain‚Äù ‚Äì is rife in the UK government also, albeit in a slightly less serious form than in certain other countries. For what is the funnelling of government contracts to manifestly incompetent companies run by cronies, or by political donors, if it is not corruption? What is the exercise of ministerial prerogative to benefit some individual, who shortly thereafter makes a donation to party funds, if not corruption?

                    <span>With children‚Äôs care in crisis, it is not enough to just paper over the cracks, writes Sue Hardman, while Prof Mike Stein recommends the implementation of progressive income tax and wealth reform to properly fund public services
Your editorial on children‚Äôs care in crisis (19 August) states that there has been a huge increase in referrals to social services, and notifications relating to domestic abuse. The article states that there is ‚Äúno scenario in which increased spending can be avoided‚Äù on children‚Äôs care.
My fear is that any increase in resources will at best paper over the cracks, and be allocated to the sharp end of child protection out of sheer necessity. But if we truly want to make a difference to our children, then we need much, much more support for early intervention, particularly with regard to those children who have witnessed domestic abuse. NSPCC research reports that one in five children may witness domestic abuse. Any child who sees such abuse is at risk of suffering from poor mental health, not only in their younger years, but well into adulthood too.

Growth is slowing and price pressures are mounting. Consumers are anxious and an important commodity is in short supply. That was the state of the UK in the mid-1970s, when a single word was used to describe a combination of recession and a rising cost of living: stagflation.
And, in a much milder form, it is the malaise that is afflicting the economy today. The shortage is of computer chips rather than crude oil but the latest snapshot from IHS Markit/Cips suggests businesses again face supply and demand constraints.

Arms jabbed, throats and noses swabbed, antiseptic liquids flowing along with the real ale and the tears: Green Man was back. As with most festivals, last year‚Äôs Covid-related cancellation imperilled this carnival of pastoral-psychedelic delight beneath the Welsh mountains. But its late summer berth allowed organisers to gamble on restrictions lifting in time for a full return in 2021. Fans kept the faith ‚Äì most tickets were rollovers from 2020 ‚Äì and were repaid with a programme that, despite few international artists, still somehow felt as solid as ever: a magical mixture of cosmic rock, alt-folk, ecstatic jazz and sanitised hands-in-the-air club music.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Finance ministers, central bank governors and political leaders are hard at work preparing for the 2021 G20 heads of state and government summit in Rome on 30-31 October. With the Covid-19 pandemic stretching well into its second year, the meeting will come at a time of heightened uncertainty about public health and the global economy. And though the mechanisms of international cooperation have been weakened by the pandemic and remain bruised by Donald Trump‚Äôs legacy, they are more important than ever.
‚ÄúCooperation‚Äù need not refer to international coordination of national monetary or fiscal policies. For the most part, countries on their own can move those levers in whatever direction is best for them. Instead, the G20 should focus on financial stability, trade and vaccination. This is in addition to other important areas, especially the existential issue of global climate change, which should and will receive a lot of attention.

In my first year as a doctor, I witnessed the fetid reality of crumbling NHS real estate. Arriving at work one morning on the emergency assessment unit ‚Äì the frenetic hub through which most of the hospital‚Äôs acutely unwell patients passed ‚Äì I discovered it had ground to a malodorous halt. Men in hard hats were shouting orders to nurses, porters were evacuating patients on trolleys. I was told a main waste pipe on the floor above had ruptured, with predictably rancid and unhygienic consequences. So much for being an NHS teaching hospital of global renown: we were literally awash with slurry.
I was reminded of these unsavoury events by Sajid Javid, who tweeted last week: ‚ÄúLooking forward to opening one of new 48 hospitals [sic] later today.‚Äù Imagine bragging about building all those new hospitals when the existing ones are so rundown and dilapidated, they can‚Äôt even contain their human excrement.

                    <span>The 14-times Paralympics gold medallist can leapfrog Mike Kenny‚Äôs record tally if she successfully defends her three titles in Tokyo
Sarah Storey‚Äôs campaign to become Britain‚Äôs most-decorated Paralympian gets under way on Wednesday, when she competes in her eighth Games in Tokyo.
Now 43, Storey, 14 times a Paralympic gold medallist, is the leading British female Paralympian. If she successfully defends titles in the C5 individual pursuit on 25 August, and C5 time trial and C4-5 road race on 31 August and 2 September, she will go past swimmer Mike Kenny.

Squirrelling away little parcels of ‚Äônduja, the intensely spicy and garlicky spreadable sausage from Calabria, in the fridge or freezer is the type of modern-day household management that I feel Mrs Beeton would appreciate; it‚Äôs the culinary equivalent of having some frankincense and myrrh in your back pocket. Its rich, rounded flavour comes from a chilli particular to Calabria, and its flavour melts and seeps into other ingredients, lending them some of its gutsy, sassy attitude. It is beautifully feisty in this seasonal tagliatelle.

                    <span>Tom Cruise doesn‚Äôt just have a single chicken tikka masala when he goes to Birmingham ‚Äì he has another one straight after. Has any man ever been more on-brand?
When Tom Cruise commits to something, he commits. When a Mission: Impossible stunt called for him to climb up the outside of the world‚Äôs tallest building, he actually climbed up the outside of the world‚Äôs tallest building. When Collateral required him to become an invisible assassin, he temporarily became a Fed-Ex driver to teach himself anonymity. When he fell in love with Katie Holmes, he did it with such couch-leaping intensity that it derailed his career for half a decade.
So when Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, he really went to Birmingham to have a curry. When Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, he did it with the same vigour that he uses to ride motorbikes or jump out of planes or scream at crew-members for not following Covid compliance protocols. Which is to say that when Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, Tom Cruise went to Birmingham and had two curries, one after the other.

Horrifying scenes are unfolding in Afghanistan. Taliban forces are reportedly going door to door, making blacklists of anyone who has worked with the former government. Even if Britain had not played a part in what‚Äôs unravelling right now, we would have a moral duty to act.
In this context, announcements from some UK regional leaders that they will accept Afghan refugees are welcome. But a years-long wait for resettlement cannot be the only protection we offer. The events unfolding in Afghanistan, with people forced to flee without a moment‚Äôs notice, show what it means to become a refugee and call into question an already rotten asylum system, which is due to go from bad to worse if the government‚Äôs new borders bill is passed.

Britain‚Äôs economic recovery from lockdown has slowed sharply in the past month despite the removal of most remaining pandemic restrictions, as businesses suffered the worst shortages of workers and materials in decades.
The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed that growth in private sector output slowed to a six-month low in August.

                    <span>Climate-conscious individual choices are good ‚Äì but not nearly enough to save the planet. More than personal virtue, we need collective action
Personal virtue is an eternally seductive goal in progressive movements, and the climate movement is no exception. People pop up all the time to boast of their domestic arrangements or chastise others for what they eat or how they get around. The very short counterargument is that individual acts of thrift and abstinence won‚Äôt get us the huge distance we need to go in this decade. We need to exit the age of fossil fuels, reinvent our energy landscape, rethink how we do almost everything. We need collective action at every scale from local to global ‚Äì and the good people already at work on all those levels need help in getting a city to commit to clean power or a state to stop fracking or a nation to end fossil-fuel subsidies. The revolution won‚Äôt happen by people staying home and being good.
But the oil companies would like you to think that‚Äôs how it works. It turns out that the concept of the ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù, that popular measure of personal impact, was the brainchild of an advertising firm working for BP. As Mark Kaufman wrote this summer:

                    <span>Pretend you‚Äôve got one foot in the Med with this cheerful medley of seafood in a chilli-and-tomato sauce that‚Äôs just made for tossing through pasta
Somewhere ‚Äì probably in one of the shoe boxes in a larger box, Russian doll-style, under the bed ‚Äì is a strip from a magazine. It is a cartoon of a man sitting at a table eating, while under the table his feet are in two trays, one containing water, the other sand. Over the table is a striped umbrella, across from another man. Both are delightedly drinking well-decorated cocktails and wearing sun hats and sunglasses, while on the other side of the room is a cat, looking unimpressed, presumably because his litter tray is being used for another purpose, or maybe because he is simply unimpressed.
When I ripped the strip, I had a particular friend in mind. One who refuses to be defeated by anything, especially regarding food. When it rained on the day of a barbecue, she was up on the roof suspending a makeshift awning. If rain turned into a storm, she would drag the grill into the largest available space and hand out cardboard for fume wafting. Her usual response to bad news or bad days is to invite people over for a meal, often with a theme, and she generally invents a new drink ‚Äì the parma violet is particularly memorable, although later painful. If you are having a bad day, she will run you a hot bath, make you chicken and barley soup, and either talk, not talk, or keep you company while watching five hours of TV.

                    <span>Ashleigh, 33 and Matt, 32, met at a fancy dress party in Vancouver. They live in London with their son and three-legged cat
Matt had been living in Vancouver for a year when he was invited to a student fancy dress party in the spring of 2014. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd moved to study for a master‚Äôs degree in entomology,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúComing from Ohio, it was the biggest city I‚Äôd ever lived in. I‚Äôd never even ridden a city bus before.‚Äù The event had a lumberjack theme, popular at Canadian house parties at the time. ‚ÄúEveryone had to dress up in plaid and overalls, and there was a giant wooden Jenga game. You had to wear a hard hat to play,‚Äù he says. When he spotted Ashleigh across the room, he couldn‚Äôt resist going to say hello. ‚ÄúI thought she looked just like Kate Bush. I‚Äôd recently discovered her music, so I went to speak to her.‚Äù
Ashleigh had moved to Vancouver from Toronto to be with her boyfriend, but it wasn‚Äôt working out. ‚ÄúI had a job in a museum, but was living in a cockroach-filled apartment and had no friends. I wanted to meet new people,‚Äù she says, and an acquaintance invited her to the party. When Matt approached, she was busy trying to negotiate the party playlist with another guest. ‚ÄúI used to have a student radio show and was really into music,‚Äù she says. They talked for a while before Matt got the courage to tell her she looked like Kate Bush. ‚ÄúPeople have actually said that about me before,‚Äù she says.

                    <span>From the right way to exercise, to what to eat and drink and the case for HRT, experts explain how women can prepare for midlife changes to their bodies
Sometimes your body notices things before your mind does: you might think you‚Äôre so far away from the menopause that a hot flush is just a thing you can fake to get out of a boring situation, but your midriff knows better. Lucinda Meade, 57, is a physiotherapist and personal trainer. She has trained many clients through the menopause and says it tends to start with surreptitious weight gain around the middle, which they then can‚Äôt shift. It may be accompanied by aches and pains in smaller joints, and an unappetising sm√∂rg√•sbord of ‚Äúmood changes, sleep changes, annoying visits to the GP to be given antidepressants‚Äù.
All this makes perfect sense from a hormonal perspective, as another trainer, Sarah Overall, 51, describes: ‚ÄúOestrogen governs so many of your bodily processes, and one of the things it‚Äôs involved in is water regulation. It‚Äôs a lot easier for tendons and ligaments and joints to become dehydrated. And that can also lead to a resurgence of old injuries.‚Äù Plus, ‚Äúwhen your female hormones decrease, you go from having a gynoid shape, carrying fat on your hips and thighs, to android obesity, abdominal fat, which is a male shape.‚Äù

Mark Sanford is not the first Republican to turn against former US president Donald Trump and pay a political price. But he is unique in publishing a memoir that links his decision to lessons learned from an extramarital affair and his attempt to cover it up.
Sanford was the governor of South Carolina when, in 2009, he flew to Argentina to be with a woman who was not his wife but told his staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. The falsehood was rapidly exposed, made lurid headlines and ended his 20-year marriage.

Annie Murphy moves straight from Schitt‚Äôs Creek to another swearily titled series, this time a bold meta-TV experiment. Part classic canned-laughter sitcom, part dark crime drama, Murphy stars as Allison, a sitcom character who constantly has to stomach her doofus husband‚Äôs sexist jokes. But the moment she‚Äôs away from him, the show morphs into a different beast, and she plots to bump Kevin off by any means necessary.

My favourite part of childhood summer holidays with my dad was our trip to the Yorkshire Dales agricultural show, a respite from his usual gruelling regime of mountain walks and examining dead fauna. Between prize rams and displays of trimmed leeks we watched the fell-running races: infants and gnarled pensioners scampering up and then down a sheer crag, all for a biscuit and a certificate.
‚ÄúLook at the little bastards!‚Äù Dad would exclaim, gesturing incredulously, plastic pint glass slopping bitter as wiry five-year-olds whizzed past, legs a blur. Lumpen by his side, mouth crammed with cake, I would feel an obscure longing: why wasn‚Äôt I a fearless, muddy-kneed dynamo?

                    <span>The Brazilian butt lift has become the world‚Äôs fastest growing cosmetic surgery, despite mounting concerns over the number of deaths from the procedure. What is driving its popularity?
This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from the year so far. This episode was first broadcast on 2 March.
Rachel Humphreys talks to Guardian writer Sophie Elmhirst about the increasing popularity of the Brazilian butt lift (BBL), which is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery in the world. Since 2015, the number of butt lifts performed globally has grown by 77.6%, according to a recent survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The BBL began in Brazil, birthplace of aesthetic surgery and the myth of the naturally ‚Äústicky-outy‚Äù bottom, the kind seen in countless tourist board images of bikini-clad women on Copacabana beach. As part of her research, Sophie spent time with the British aesthetic surgeon Dr Lucy Glancey and her patient Melissa*, who was planning to have her second BBL. Sophie tells Rachel why she thinks more and more women are demanding the procedure despite the risks ‚Äì the BBL has been called the world‚Äôs most dangerous procedure.

The game was originally suspended in the 75th minute when Marseille players and Nice fans had to be separated after bottles were thrown between the two during their league match. An on-pitch melee ensued and the game had to be delayed by the match officials.

Celtic have described racist social media footage ‚Äì featuring travelling Rangers fans mocking the Japanese forward Kyogo Furuhashi ‚Äì as ‚Äúsickening and pathetic‚Äù.
Rangers have launched an investigation after the video, from a supporters‚Äô bus, emerged on Sunday afternoon, when Steven Gerrard‚Äôs side were in Dingwall for a 4-2 win over Ross County. Fans were seen singing racist songs and making offensive eye gestures to mobile phones.

Boris Johnson will personally lobby Joe Biden at the G7 leaders summit, No 10 said on Sunday night, pleading with him to keep US troops at Kabul airport beyond the end of August, after a weekend of tension between the UK and its closest ally.
With the Taliban tightening their grip at the airport, Downing Street confirmed the PM would lobby the US president on Tuesday at the virtual meeting. The news came as Taliban forces sought to assert their authority, blaming the US for the ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù at the airport and insisting they were the only ones capable of restoring order. Throughout the day, Taliban fighters fired their guns into the air and used batons to force people into orderly queues in an attempt to halt the desperate scenes in which at least 20 people have died.

When Ruby Wax Met ‚Ä¶ (BBC Two) gives us a double whammy of Wax, then and now, and proves to be an absorbing analysis of celebrity, fame and the massive cultural shifts that have taken place over the past four decades. In the 90s and early 00s, Wax pioneered documentary-style celebrity interviews, with the camera often rolling before she and her subject had even met. She spent time with A-list stars such as Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn and OJ Simpson (more on him later) and was granted a level of access that is unheard of in this age of brand management and ‚Äúcontrolling the narrative‚Äù.
Now a writer, comedian and mental health campaigner, Wax says she has not seen these interviews for 25 years: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another life. It doesn‚Äôt even feel like the same skin.‚Äù

States are continuing to push back against the terms of a nationally agreed plan to open up the country once vaccination rates hit 70% and 80%, warning the worsening Covid crisis in NSW could yet be a dealbreaker.
As a pared-down federal parliament prepares to sit in Canberra on Monday amid the ACT‚Äôs lockdown, the prime minister Scott Morrison is insisting that growing case numbers are not a reason to abandon the national plan agreed to by all states and territories.

                    <span>The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. It is now set for its highest number of gun killings in 20 years
As Covid cases surge once more in the US, another public health crisis is pummelling the country too. Last year, gun killings soared by around 4,000, to almost 20,000 in total ‚Äì the worst single-year increase on record. So far, 2021 looks even worse. In the first five months alone, more than 8,100 people died. America is set for the deadliest toll in nearly two decades.
Alarmingly, there is also a surge in gun purchases. The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. But last year saw a 64% jump compared with the previous year, to an estimated 20m guns. Around a fifth of buyers were first-time owners. The pandemic sparked a rush to purchase firearms, and some bought because so many others were doing so. The backlash against Black Lives Matter protests may have played a part. Black Americans saw the highest increase in gun ownership and, reportedly, Asian Americans also bought more guns, as hate crimes have risen. Sales have continued to grow this year, with manufacturers struggling to produce enough ammunition.

                    <span>An acute shortage of staff offers an incentive to improve a stressful working culture
White Heat, by Marco Pierre White, is one of the most influential recipe books of the past 30 years. Published in 1990, its edgy black and white photography popularised an idea of the chef-as-hero, immersed in the creative Sturm und Drang of a frantically busy restaurant kitchen. Its cover features a handsome 28-year-old Mr White in a butcher‚Äôs apron, looking moody and a little like Jim Morrison.
For most chefs the reality has always been much less romantic. Long, unsociable hours are often poorly rewarded, and a sometimes brutal workload makes cheffing one of the most stressful ways to earn a living. Burnout is commonplace, and a healthy work-life balance difficult to maintain. One 2019 survey found that eight out of 10 employees in professional kitchens had experienced mental health problems during their career. Research by the Unite union discovered that 52% of chefs have a negative view of their jobs and only 22% would recommend the life to school-leavers. Happily, there are some tentative early signs that the hospitality hiatus caused by Covid may lead to change for the better.

Antibody tests are to be offered widely to the UK public as part of a new programme which a leading scientist said could lead to targeted booster vaccinations for vulnerable people.
Thousands of adults will receive tests each day as part of a government scheme exploring how much natural protection people have after getting coronavirus.

                    <span>Author and illustrator of relatable yet magical children‚Äôs books, including The Worst Witch and Whatever Next!
The children‚Äôs author and illustrator Jill Murphy, who has died of cancer aged 72, was loved across generations for picture books that capture the essence of childhood in a realistic yet magical way.
Her career began at the age of 24 when her first book, The Worst Witch (1974), was published. An immediate success, it has consistently been on every list of top recommendations for seven-year-olds ever since. Equally successful have been her picture books about the everyday life of both the Bear family in Peace at Last in 1980 and the Large family in Five Minutes‚Äô Peace in 1986. They and their sequels have been go-to books for children and parents alike with their humorous interpretations of the trials of parenthood.

Watching recorded dance on your laptop at home couldn‚Äôt be further from the Edinburgh fringe experience: the buzz on the streets, the overload of shows, the odd venues and out-there experiences. But there‚Äôs still plenty that‚Äôs out there on the digital side. You can get your fix of, say, naked experimental circus, in Race Horse Company‚Äôs O‚ÄôDD for example. It‚Äôs not wholly naked, I should say: later in the solo, Rauli Dahlberg‚Äôs body wrapped in clingfilm, flipping on a trampoline is rather mesmerising. 
There are more trampolines in a meditative quartet Ground Unplugged; four dancers on trampettes locked in a synchronised bounce. Or there‚Äôs Touchdown, a half-dance, half-physics lecture from Taiwan, in which Cheng Hao combines discussing the reckless and unpredictable nature of electrons with insomniac musings on the meaning of life, while seemingly peeling himself from the ceiling.

The figures show that the use of fossil-fuel hydrogen, or ‚Äúblue hydrogen‚Äù, would create the same carbon emissions each year that more than a million petrol cars would produce, compared with using zero-carbon ‚Äúgreen hydrogen‚Äù.

Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo praised Harry Kane for helping Tottenham Hotspur to victory at Wolves in the striker‚Äôs first appearance of the season. With Kane‚Äôs future remaining uncertain as Manchester City contemplate whether to make another attempt to prise him from north London, the player came on as a 71st-minute substitute at Molineux, where Spurs won 1-0 thanks to an early penalty by Dele Alli.
Kane was applauded on to the pitch by the travelling fans, a gesture he reciprocated after the final whistle. ‚ÄúHe did well, he helped the team,‚Äù said Nuno of the striker who could have marked his return with a goal but saw his shot saved by Jos√© S√°. ‚ÄúHe is still in the process of improving his fitness.

                    <span>The ex-Inbetweener‚Äôs new work-in-progress standup show, about breaking beyond being typecast, has a self-lacerating character
The maladroit comic parlaying their anxiety into humour is as old as standup itself. But it‚Äôs a highwire act: other people‚Äôs neuroses can be funny, or ‚Äì one wrong step ‚Äì troubling instead. Is it unfair to expect sure-footedness from Trying Not to Panic, the standup debut of ex-Inbetweener Joe Thomas? Perhaps ‚Äì it‚Äôs a work-in-progress after all, like so many of the offerings on this year‚Äôs Edinburgh not-quite-the-fringe. Comedians have had few opportunities to hone their shows, or their craft, over the past 18 months. It‚Äôs not been the optimum period in which to launch a new set, much less a new standup career. (A difficulty with which fellow Inbetweener Simon Bird has also wrestled.)
So: the good news is that this is a striking debut from Thomas, here to lament his career stasis and how the Channel 4 sitcom for ever defines him in the public perception. And the less good news? Well, I‚Äôm not sure the show‚Äôs humour is sufficiently buoyant ‚Äì yet ‚Äì to lift audiences above Thomas‚Äôs pit of despair. Some of the gags are awfully cynical, and the self-lacerating character of the comedy left me uncertain whether to laugh with Thomas, or worry for him.

                    <span>Theatr Clywd, Mold
Letting the audience choose props and costumes adds both absurd and affecting possibilities to this selection of 15 new short plays
Directed by Theatr Clwyd‚Äôs artistic director, Tamara Harvey, Curtain Up is an appropriately celebratory title for the company‚Äôs three-week season of 15 new short plays by writers from Wales, performed by a cast of 30. For each of the three weeks, five plays are performed by 10 actors at each performance.
With each play at little over 10 minutes in length, it allows for swift and playful variations in dramatic tone and formal experimentation. In the first week‚Äôs plays, Samantha O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs Finding Feet was a movingly heartfelt monologue of love at first sight, while in The Ongoing Eternal Search for ‚ÄúDa‚Äù by Mari Izzard, sexual tensions were inflamed to Nintendo sound effects.
The central conceit common in all of these dramatic vignettes is that each contains an unspecified significant object. These props are chosen by the audience at the beginning of each performance, as well as a costume, unknown to the performers. We are also invited to intervene in the casting of roles. The performance begins, and the five plays unfurl according to the audience‚Äôs interventions, in this case performed by the first week‚Äôs uniformly great cast.

You have to admire the genius of the UK‚Äôs refugee policy: first, no one who gets here unofficially can be considered for asylum and the only way to get here is by official routes ‚Äì but there are no official routes in (UK to take 20,000 Afghan refugees over five years under resettlement plan, 17 August). And second, with the Afghan crisis, we are told by Whitehall that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to do this on the basis of whoever can get themselves to Kabul airport over the course of the next week ‚Ä¶ that means most people will be coming via third countries‚Äù. And there is the genius of the approach: anyone coming via third countries will be told that they should claim asylum in the first one they come to, absolving the need for the UK to take any at all. Catch-22 made real.
And we have to endure boasts about the UK‚Äôs long record of welcoming refugees ‚Äì one MP was heard bleating on BBC Radio 4 last week that Britain leads the world in taking people in. Lord Dubs was quoted in the same report as saying that if Canada can take in 20,000 refugees now, why can‚Äôt the UK do better than 20,000 over five years?

                    <span>Sue Miller and Sean Tompkins on the importance of retrofitting and reuse of materials in construction in order to reduce the UK‚Äôs carbon emissions
Your article on the importance of retrofit and reuse of buildings over new-build is most timely (Editorial, 18 August). As the planning bill makes its way through parliament this autumn, it could be amended to reflect the shocking disparity in carbon emissions that you highlight. Indeed, as the bill is likely to be debated while the UK hosts Cop26, it would seem perverse of the government not to take the opportunity to bring the planning system and construction industry into line with the Cop26 objectives. 
Sue Miller 
Liberal Democrat, House of Lords
‚Ä¢ Changes to VAT rates on the refurbishment and repair of buildings are long overdue. There are nearly 30m buildings in the UK, and approximately 28m of these will need to be retrofitted by the end of 2050 to meet our net zero commitments. Given that the energy used to run our homes accounts for over a quarter of all CO2 emissions, there is an urgent need to do more.

United wiped the floor with Leeds last weekend but had to settle for a point here as Mason Greenwood equalised to extend their unbeaten away league run to 27 games, matching Arsenal‚Äôs top-flight record.
Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r‚Äôs side were erratic and off-colour, teasing only patches of class for the noisy travelling fans. Southampton proved fiendish opponents, successfully shackling United‚Äôs glittering cast and could have earned victory on another day. For Solskj√¶r, the warning signs were there long before Adams‚Äô shot beat David de Gea, via a wicked deflection off Fred, with half an hour gone. ‚ÄúWe lost our heads when they scored,‚Äù Solskj√¶r said.

Spanish police have arrested a couple over accusations they were carrying out rituals ‚Äì billed online as ‚Äúinternational ancestral medicine‚Äù ‚Äì involving an array of banned substances ranging from toad venom to ayahuasca.
The couple, aged 42 and 38, allegedly ran an association that performed ceremonies involving psychotropic substances for as much as ‚Ç¨150 (¬£129) a session. Weekend retreats were also on offer at a cost of up to ‚Ç¨350 (¬£300).

Sainsbury‚Äôs could be on the shopping list of private equity outfits as the race to buy Morrisons highlights the attractiveness of the big supermarket chains to investors.
Last week the buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) won the backing of the Morrisons board for its ¬£7bn offer to buy the UK‚Äôs fourth largest supermarket chain. That bettered the ¬£6.7bn already on the table from rival suitor Fortress.

Parts of state receive quarter of annual rainfall in a morning

Catastrophic flooding in Middle Tennessee left at least 10 people dead and dozens missing as record-shattering rainfall washed away homes and rural roads, authorities said.
Business owner Kansas Klein watched in horror from a bridge on Saturday morning as cars and entire houses were swept down a road in Waverly, a town of about 4,500 people that Klein, 48, has called home for more than half his life.

                    <span>From Neil Young to Keith Richards, a generation of musicians revered Phil and Don‚Äôs haunting music
‚Ä¢ US music star Don Everly dies aged 84
Among the hundreds of hours of outtakes from the recording sessions that eventually became the Beatles‚Äô Let It Be album, there is a version of Two of Us, taped on 25 January 1969. As John Lennon and Paul McCartney harmonise, the latter says to the former: ‚ÄúTake it, Phil‚Äù, a reference to Phil and Don Everly, the duo upon whom the pair had originally attempted to model themselves. On an early holiday, Lennon and McCartney attempted to impress local girls by telling them they had a band back home and they were ‚Äúthe British Everly Brothers‚Äù.
Shortly afterwards, the pair temporarily stopped working on the song entirely and began performing a ragged cover of Bye Bye Love instead. It‚Äôs both oddly sweet ‚Äì a fleeting moment where the ill-tempered sessions actually achieved their aim of returning the Beatles to their roots ‚Äì and oddly telling. At the end of a decade in which they had done more than anyone to alter rock music entirely, shifting its parameters until it was occasionally unrecognisable from the state in which it had started the 60s ‚Äì and rendering the likes of Don and Phil Everly old news in the process ‚Äì John Lennon and Paul McCartney still wanted to sound like the Everly Brothers. Throughout it all, McCartney later wrote, ‚Äútheir music echoed through my mind‚Äù.

                    <span>Any evaluation of the campaign must prioritise genuine investigation over reputation management
It was an extraordinary volte-face. On 7 August Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff and professional head of Britain‚Äôs military, wrote an op-ed on Afghanistan in the Times stating that it was too soon ‚Äúto write off the country‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are increasing signs that the population is rallying in defiance,‚Äù he added. Eleven days later, after the Taliban had taken Afghanistan‚Äôs provincial capitals, followed by Kabul, and the Afghan army ‚Äì raised by the west at a cost of $83bn ‚Äì had melted away, Carter appeared on television. ‚ÄúYou have to be very careful using the word enemy,‚Äù he told Sky News. ‚ÄúPeople need to understand who the Taliban actually are ‚Ä¶ They are bound together by a common purpose which is they don‚Äôt like corrupt governance ‚Ä¶ I do think that they have changed.‚Äù 
The general deserves some compassion. Like the rest of the leadership of Britain‚Äôs army, the post-9/11 wars defined his professional life. Carter commanded a brigade in Iraq in 2003-04 and later led a ‚Äúregional command‚Äù in Afghanistan. His recent public pronouncements suggest an understandable desire not to undercut the sacrifices of his troops. Nonetheless, Carter‚Äôs dramatic pivot, combined ‚Äì more bluntly ‚Äì with the fact that he is still in post, underlines an important point. There is an urgent need within the British military now for a root and branch appraisal of why this has all happened. Yet, due to a variety of factors, both inside and outside the military, a full postmortem is unlikely.

The hottest summer nights of my life were in Australia around the Christmas of 1988. My brother was on a gap year with a mate, working in a factory in Dandenong, a suburb of Melbourne. They were living in a tiny, scruffy caravan in an overgrown field when I went to visit. It had come with air-conditioning, they explained, but on their first night it shook violently for a few seconds upon being switched on, before dying.
The heat in this oven they called home was simply appalling. I slept not at all. But this was only the third-most terrible night of my life; the second-worst and the very worst were still a couple of weeks away.

                    <span>Exclusive: travellers let down by private providers are being forced to fall back on the taxpayer-funded NHS service

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

A Covid-19 testing company co-owned by a former Labour justice minister and a Labour councillor has been accused of failing to deliver kits and test results and not refunding customers, forcing them to fall back on the NHS.
RT Diagnostics is one of hundreds of firms that won government approval to sell PCR tests to travellers planning to enter England, after ministers decided to leave provision to the private sector, under a system that has drawn criticism over allegations of poor service against several companies.

Ali Jawad posted a picture of himself on a table top this weekend. Mask on, power shake to hand, Jawad‚Äôs arms were raised in celebration. The British powerlifter, who was born without legs and also deals with the debilitating effects of Crohn‚Äôs disease, had made it to the athletes‚Äô village in Tokyo. ‚ÄúArrived in the Paralympic village!! Absolutely amazing view from our rooms,‚Äù he wrote, adding a drooling emoji to reinforce the point.

The first time the Taliban took Kabul, 25 years ago they tortured and killed former President Mohammad Najibullah, dragged his body behind a truck through the streets, then hung it from a lamp-post.
Last week, with Kabul surrounded and a second victory almost inevitable, the Taliban ordered their troops to hold back from entering the city, to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. When they did march in, it was to a soundtrack of their commanders offering an ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù for anyone who had opposed them over the last two decades.

A former defence minister has said the UK failed to ‚Äústand up‚Äù to the US over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, amid more questions about Dominic Raab‚Äôs holiday-induced absence last weekend.
Raab, the foreign secretary, has faced repeated demands to resign for remaining until Monday on a family holiday in Crete while the Afghan government collapsed, and delegating tasks to junior ministers.

An old party with an ageing membership, fronted by a politician with all the charisma of a middle-ranking bank clerk, following the humiliating descent from national institution to electoral also-rans already suffered by its comrades across Europe. The obituary of Germany‚Äôs Social Democratic party (SPD) had already been written.
Yet as Germany‚Äôs election campaign is about to enter its home stretch, it is the centre-left party of Olaf Scholz that is enjoying a surge of energy as its rivals start to lag.

I find myself wondering why I am still so invested in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale on a weekly basis, as the camera slowly closes in on Elisabeth Moss‚Äôs face, her character June pained and broken by cruelty after cruelty. The apocalyptic drama is coming to the end of its fourth run, and when this season began, it found itself boxed into an inevitable corner. How could it sustain the story far beyond Margaret Atwood‚Äôs novel, without keeping its characters in a cage, and becoming an unrewarding display of relentless misery?
It had begun to go around in circles. June would defy the rules, escape the authorities, get captured, undergo torture, and then begin the whole cycle again. It made it hard for viewers to feel satisfaction in her victories. What was the point in rooting for her, if she would inevitably end up back at the start?

Forty years ago a small group of women, along with a few men and children in buggies in tow, left their homes in Wales to protest against the arrival of US nuclear warheads at RAF Greenham Common. The steps they took that day would lead to the establishment of the Greenham women‚Äôs peace camp, which at its height gathered more than 70,000 women for direct action and became the biggest female-led protest since women‚Äôs suffrage.
Now hundreds more will march 130 miles to mark the 40th anniversary of the camp and call for the original women who led it to be remembered and respected as much as the suffragettes.

Channel 4 plans to broadcast a record 1,300 hours of coverage of the Tokyo Games, almost three times the amount the BBC managed with its Olympic coverage, cementing its place as the world‚Äôs leading Paralympic broadcaster.

This is the most extraordinary summer I can remember. The day on which monsoon-style rains smashed my tomato plants to rags was followed by one so hot and dry I could barely find the energy to toss a salad. This is the future I guess, when those of us who like to cook not only seasonally but also for the weather will be kept on their toes. (Last week we went from eating tomato salad in the garden to wanting pie and mashed potatoes by the fire in the space of 24 hours.) I am getting used to planning no further ahead than my next meal. A certain spontaneity is required if we are to cook in tune with this crazy, unpredictable weather.
There was a tray of sardines at the fishmonger‚Äôs the other day ‚Äì silver, black and gold with eyes as bright as jewels. An all too rare sighting of a seasonal fish I first met as a kid, tucked up in golden tins of tomato sauce that you opened with a little metal key. Then we ate them on toast for tea.

Tucked into the foothills of northern Spain, the village of Trasmoz attracts thousands of tourists each year. For many, the allure is not its half-ruined castle nor stunning mountain backdrop but rather a curious quirk of history: Trasmoz is Spain‚Äôs only excommunicated and cursed village.

                    <span>The foreign secretary was in good company in woefully misjudging the Taliban threat
Many of the excitable characters who impulsively phone talk radio stations without having thought through their contradictory positions are rightly horrified by footage of desperate people falling off planes into the chaotic inferno of hate of Biden and Johnson‚Äôs bodged British and American withdrawal from Afghanistan. Others, explaining that Brexit was about stopping refugees and immigration, want everyone there to be left to die, as sorting out the mess we have made is apparently not our business. Admittedly, I have the same attitude to the toilet bowl after an ill-advised lamb phaal, but I am just a 53-year-old ‚Äúso-called‚Äù comedian, not an elected leader of the free world with blood on his hands.
On Wednesday, I drove distractedly across England listening to a baffling prime minister‚Äôs questions. Various politicians, trying to read the fickle electorate‚Äôs current position on the hate/compassion mood board, swinging again like it did after the death of little Alan Kurdi, explained how welcoming Britain has always been to refugees. I stopped to eat an artisanal steak pie at the Rollright Stones and wondered how our legendarily welcoming nature squared with the government‚Äôs new nationality and borders bill, which aims to criminalise anyone who attempts to seek asylum and anyone who attempts to help anyone seeking asylum. Even lifeboat men and women risking their lives to dredge dying children from the Channel could be criminals it seems, the horrible bastards. A fake Home Office website called Migrants on the Move, like the fake Conservative Campaign HQ factcheckUK site Dominic Raab defended during the last election, even purports to offer objective but deliberately discouraging advice to would-be Britons. Who even knew that the UK was full of venomous hamsters and that, in Kent, human hair is illegal?

                    <span>Hordes of capybaras have taken up residence at a gated community, sparking a debate on the environment and inequality
Nordelta is Argentina‚Äôs most well-known gated community: an enclave of spacious homes for the rich amid a dreamy landscape of lakes and streams north of Buenos Aires.
But environmentalists question its very existence because it is built on the wetlands of the Paran√°, the second most important river in South America after the Amazon.

                    <span>According to addiction expert Dr Anna Lembke, our smartphones are making us dopamine junkies, with each swipe, like and tweet feeding our habit. So how do we beat our digital dependency?
Dr Anna Lembke, a world-leading expert on addiction, is concerned about my ‚Äúphone problem‚Äù. During our interview I confess, in passing, to having an unhealthy attachment to my iPhone, checking it every few minutes like a compulsive tic (sound familiar?) Lembke is having none of it. She wants me to abstain from using it for at least 24 hours by locking it in a drawer and going out. The first 12 hours will be filled with anxiety and Fomo, but as time unfolds, I‚Äôll experience a sense of ‚Äúreal freedom‚Äù, will gain insight into my relationship with my digital companion and will ‚Äúresolve to get back to using it a little differently‚Äù, she says, speaking with a soothing yet firm tone.
I‚Äôd do well to heed her advice. As the chief of Stanford University‚Äôs dual diagnosis addiction clinic (which caters to people with more than one disorder), Lembke has spent the past 25-plus years treating patients addicted to everything from heroin, gambling and sex to video games, Botox and ice baths. The bespectacled 53-year-old psychiatrist has written an influential book about the prescription-drug epidemic, delivered Ted Talks on America‚Äôs opioid crisis and appeared as a talking head in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma to discuss the drug that is social media. She‚Äôs a whiz on why we get hooked on things ‚Äì and how we can enjoy pleasurable things in healthier doses.

Being in someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs house when they are not there (and you‚Äôre not a burglar) is a contemplative experience, like walking round a film set. It may be people that make a home, but an empty home, that once held people, still holds something. I‚Äôm in my mother‚Äôs house and she‚Äôs not here, because she‚Äôs away and even though I‚Äôve been here a hundred times since I left home, this time it feels different. I fill the sink with cups that I only wash on a need-to-use basis, and I eat chicken fillets and berries, like a forager with access to a deli counter. I live like this for days. I visit the dentist and then my old friend, Andrea, picks me up and feeds me pizza and the most glorious five-ingredient (chocolate, eggs, sugar, butter and flour) Claudia Roden torta di cioccolato from Roden‚Äôs The Food of Italy, which I urge you to buy and try.

Depending on where you look on social media, making money seems to be straightforward. Learning how to buy a property in the UK with no money, or getting the basics of being a day trader in 30 minutes, are both lessons on YouTube, along with a plethora of advice on how to earn from cryptocurrency. Meanwhile ‚Äúfinfluencers‚Äù, with varying degrees of knowledge, have blossomed on Instagram and TikTok.
But the standard of advice varies widely from grounded, sage information on how to invest, to unregulated personalities offering shallow quick takes without fully setting out the pitfalls of what might happen to your money.

Last July, Filippo Mancini, a fourth-generation ice-cream maker, ran the Belly Banger competition from his shop on the esplanade at Prestwick beach in Ayrshire.
Punters paid ¬£7.50 for 12 scoops ‚Äì ‚Äúwhatever flavours you wanted, a wee biscuit in the top and some cream‚Äù. They had 15 minutes to eat them. If they managed it they got a certificate and their money back. Mancini, who says about a dozen people succeeded, plans to run the competition again this September.

                    <span>Having suffered a 90% drop in population, they still face extinction in Britain ‚Äì but a new initiative offers a glimmer of hope
A hundred and fifty water voles were last week settling into new homes on the riverbanks of Hertfordshire. The animals had been released from pens the previous week as part of a campaign to halt the devastating drop in Arvicola amphibius number across the British Isles over the past 50 years.
Once widespread in the UK, water voles ‚Äì whose most known incarnation is Ratty in Wind in the Willows ‚Äì have suffered a 90% drop in population since the 1970s. Feral mink, which kill young voles in their nests, in combination with major changes in land use, have resulted in the widespread eradication of a species that was once a ubiquitous presence along the banks of Britain‚Äôs rivers.

                    <span>Allowing yourself to daydream about the perfect home is one thing, but the romance is spoiled as soon as you open the door on to real world
My friend is trying to buy a flat in Bristol, and each time he sends me a link with a little question mark, I get a complicated rush. Looking at property websites has been an anti-pleasure of mine for many years now, and sometimes I browse as meditation, other times masochism, often as a sorbet-like palate cleanser before paddling into a crisis.
But this week the flat he was viewing had an oddness to it and it took a minute for me to work out what was wrong. I realised, with unsurprised shock, that the furniture was not of human size. The rooms had been staged ‚Äì with a chest of drawers the width of a shelf, a single bed had been made up with two pillows to appear as a double, and so on ‚Äì with a certain poetry. The decoration was to nobody‚Äôs taste, which I respect ‚Äì pastel velvet cushions, many small and sharp-angled mirrors, a wide-backed chair masquerading as a sofa, a cheese plant instead of a wardrobe. The flat was furnished for an unhappy couple seen from a distance and still he was outbid, which is good because it means I can carry on looking.

                    <span>Many of us have been confounded by recent figures, but the British model remains flawed
British capitalism seems to be on a roll. A million job vacancies were advertised in July, a new monthly record. Early signs are that unwinding the furlough scheme, now under way, is not going to cause a sharp rise in unemployment.
House prices are rising at the fastest rate since 2004. Public borrowing in July halved compared with last July. Many new companies are being created. Business confidence is rising. The recovery is moving so fast as threats of lockdown recede that the UK on average will get back to pre-pandemic levels of output before the year is out. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, can indulge his boss‚Äôs tantrums; his political position could hardly be stronger.

                    <span>The Oscar-winning film-maker‚Äôs image, shot on a vintage train in Germany, features in a new book of his off-duty documentary photography
Long before he was a cinematographer, Roger Deakins was a photographer. The film-maker‚Äôs eye that has earned Deakins 15 Oscar nominations (and two Oscars) in celebrated work with the Coen brothers, Sam Mendes and others first found its expression in documentary photography of rural north Devon in the early 1970s.
Some of those formative pictures of farm hands and country fairs are collected in the first monograph of Deakin‚Äôs photography work. They take their place alongside images such as this one, which was taken on the set of The Reader, the film of Bernhard Schlink‚Äôs Holocaust novel, made in Germany in 2007. Although Deakins says he often used a still camera to take photographs of locations or to plan lighting rigs for particular scenes, occasionally, off duty and off set, he returned to his first vocation, just looking for little moments that captured his attention.

                    <span>At the Jackson Hole bankers‚Äô summit this week, the talk will be of ending quantitative easing ‚Äì and this time it will be serious
It is credited with preventing the worst global recession since at least the second world war from turning into something far worse. But after the injection of trillions of dollars into financial markets to cushion the blow from Covid-19, the era of quantitative easing could be coming to an end.
This week, attention will turn to the gathering of central bank chiefs in Jackson Hole for clues about how the US Federal Reserve plans to bring its vast QE bond-buying programme to an eventual halt after more than a year of emergency stimulus.

Israeli aircraft struck Hamas sites in Gaza late on Saturday, the military said, in an escalation of hostilities after earlier cross-border gunfire seriously injured an Israeli soldier and wounded 41 Palestinians, including two critically.
The injuries came during a Gaza protest organised by the enclave‚Äôs Islamist rulers, Hamas, and other factions in support of Jerusalem, where Palestinian clashes with Israeli police helped spark an 11-day Israel-Hamas conflict in May.

Afghanistan is facing an ‚Äúabsolute catastrophe‚Äù involving widespread hunger, homelessness and economic collapse unless an urgent humanitarian effort is agreed in the wake of the US withdrawal, world leaders are warned today.
With growing anger over Britain‚Äôs chaotic evacuation effort and people killed in a crush around Kabul airport yesterday, a meeting of G7 leaders has been hastily arranged for early this week. Senior figures in Kabul warned that the latest chaos is combining with drought, huge displacements of people and economic paralysis to create a disaster requiring immediate international action.

Even Jorginho finds the idea that he could win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr this year hard to accept. He did not take it as an insult when he heard Antonio Cassano, the former Italy striker, say that any journalist who votes for the Chelsea midfielder ‚Äúshould have his licence taken away‚Äù.
Instead of picking a fight with Cassano after finding him on an Italian beach earlier this summer, Jorginho found common ground with the 39-year-old, agreeing that it would be a scandal if he takes the Ballon d‚ÄôOr off Lionel Messi. ‚ÄúNow I admire Jorginho even more,‚Äù Cassano said last week. ‚ÄúWe were talking for a good 90 minutes.

The celebrated leader Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r channels most often is Alex Ferguson, not Theodore Roosevelt, but even as he seeks to borrow from his mentor‚Äôs blueprint, the Manchester United manager turned to a past US president to argue Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford should be spared the sort of vitriolic reception that greeted David Beckham after the 1998 World Cup.
While Rashford is sidelined by a shoulder injury, Sancho, another to miss a penalty in England‚Äôs fateful Euro 2020 final shootout, could make his first appearance on enemy territory at St Mary‚Äôs on Sunday.

Experts have described the fall of Afghanistan‚Äôs government as a setback to potential evidence-gathering activities stemming from the Brereton report, even though it is possible the Taliban would be receptive to such investigations.

It‚Äôs also the problem of clubs: for all the talk of identities and DNA, very few of them actually have a cogent philosophy that binds first team to youth sides, or at least not one that has been in place for long enough to turn out a player who can return almost two decades after their debut to find an academy still turning out players shaped by the same prevailing idea.

                    <span>Admitting cowardice is a subversive act within cultures that demand lip service
Most of us aren‚Äôt brave. We wouldn‚Äôt protest in the streets of Kabul as armed and triumphant clerical reactionaries fingered their guns. I am hardly breaking news when I say that fear makes us keep our heads down and conform. But how we conform makes a world of difference. Oppressive regimes, organisations and political cultures insist that we pretend to go along with them willingly. On occasion, the most courageous way to fight them is simply to admit we are afraid.
Outside abusive personal relationships, fear produces sycophantic subservience in two areas that dominate life in otherwise safe and democratic countries. In most workplaces, managers allow little or no free discussion or criticism. The cases of dictatorial power that have become famous are when managerial megalomania has led corporations to disaster ‚Äì Enron, for instance, or NatWest. But anyone who looks honestly at their working lives will accept that in many hierarchies most of the time men and women in superior positions demand subservience and, like absolute monarchs, are shocked when they do not receive it.

The final major of 2021 may deliver the most extraordinary story of all. In among the big names on a gloriously tight leaderboard at the Women‚Äôs Open sits Louise Duncan, the 21-year-old amateur champion. The only time Duncan had cause to frown on day three here was when she was reminded she is not eligible for the ¬£640,000 bounty on offer to any professional winner. ‚ÄúThanks for that,‚Äù said Duncan, a University of Stirling student. ‚ÄúI could be drowning my sorrows tomorrow, tears rolling down my face.‚Äù
Imagine being so tantalisingly close to such riches one cannot claim.

A murder investigation has been launched after a man was stabbed to death in south-west London. The 22-year-old was found after police were called out at 3.45am on Saturday to reports of a disturbance in Clarence Street, Kingston.
The Metropolitan police said a 19-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and possession of an offensive weapon, while an 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both men are in custody at a south London police station.

Alan Johnson grew up in working-class Notting Hill, London, in the 1950s, raised by his teenage sister after their mother‚Äôs death. He left school at 15 and worked as a postman, a union leader and a Labour MP and cabinet minister under Tony Blair. The spry author of four award-winning memoirs, retirement is not his style. He left politics in 2017 and now, at 71, is publishing his first work of fiction ‚Äì a thriller ‚Äì The Late Train to Gipsy Hill.
I gather you wanted to be a writer before you ever thought of becoming a politician?
When the Beatles‚Äô Paperback Writer came out in 1966, I wanted to be a paperback writer. I‚Äôve dedicated The Late Train to Gipsy Hill to my amazing English teacher ¬≠‚Äì Peter Carlin. He had natural authority, a mellifluous voice and never went anywhere near the cane. I not only admired him, he was the first teacher I liked. He treated us as adults. I submitted short detective stories to him: Inspector Andrew and Mr Midnight. Mr Carlin said: ‚ÄúAlan, have you ever thought of sending these off?‚Äù When I got the inevitable rejections, he said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up. All great writers could paper their walls with rejection slips.‚Äù I sent him a facsimile of the book‚Äôs dedication for his 90th birthday.

Some economic effects of the coronavirus are obvious. Pre-pandemic, the share of retail sales conducted online had taken around eight years to go from 10% to 20%, but then in nine months shot up to 36% in January 2021.
But perhaps more surprising was a recent dramatic headline from Bloomberg: ‚ÄúUK Wage Growth Hits a Record as Vacancies Pass 1 Million‚Äù. This was based on estimates from the Office for National Statistics‚Äô monthly wages and salaries survey that average regular pay had increased by 7.4% over the past year. So why should we be cautious in interpreting this huge rise?

The Covid Delta variant has swept across south-east Asia over recent months, prompting lockdowns and overwhelming hospitals ‚Äì from Malaysia to Thailand and Indonesia. Now the impact is being felt in the Philippines, just as the country‚Äôs chronic lack of health workers reaches a crisis point.
‚ÄúThe disease has become very aggressive,‚Äù said Michael Bilan, who works on a Covid ward in Manila. This time, patients tend to require a higher amount of oxygen, for longer, he said. The number of Covid patients is also at a record high: last week, 277 were receiving treatment. New wards have been opened to meet demand.

                    <span>The professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience discusses his work to develop a scientific explanation for how the brain conjures consciousness
For centuries, philosophers have theorised about the mind-body question, debating the relationship between the physical matter of the brain and the conscious mental activity it somehow creates. Even with advances in neuroscience and brain imaging techniques, large parts of that fundamental relationship remain stubbornly mysterious. It was with good reason that, in 1995, the cognitive scientist David Chalmers coined the term ‚Äúthe hard problem‚Äù to describe the question of exactly how our brains conjure subjective conscious experience. Some philosophers continue to insist that mind is inherently distinct from matter. Advances in understanding how the brain functions undermine those ideas of dualism, however.
Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, is at the leading edge of that latter research. His Ted talk on consciousness has been viewed more than 11m times. His new book, Being You, proposes an idea of the human mind as a ‚Äúhighly evolved prediction machine‚Äù, rooted in the functions of the body and ‚Äúconstantly hallucinating the world and the self‚Äù to create reality.

                    <span>Writing a diary is a great way to offload ‚Äì and, if memory fails, it‚Äôs a wonderful window on the past
I still get funny looks from people when I mention that I keep a diary. Maybe the practice strikes them as shifty or weirdly old-fashioned. It‚Äôs true that I never feel more furtive than when my wife finds me writing it at our kitchen table ‚Äì it‚Äôs like being spotted entering a confessional box in church. What exactly have I got to tell this black book about a life that we share all day, every day? What secrets can I possibly be keeping?
The answer: nothing of any great note, and yet so much of my life is in it. I started writing a journal (as I used to call it) when I went on holiday. Twenty years ago I decided to go full-time and since then I‚Äôve kept it more or less every day. Why? I suppose it began as an experiment ‚Äì and became an obligation. You can‚Äôt hold back time, but you can try to save the past from being completely erased. It often feels trivial to record things as they happen (a stray remark, hearing a song, fleeting moments of doom or delight), but later they may prove useful, or instructive, or amusing. It also maintains the illusion of diligence ‚Äì that you‚Äôre not just pissing away the days. A diary is good exercise for the writing muscle, the way a pianist practises scales or a footballer does keepy-uppies. During lockdown, like everyone else, I got into routines that felt numbing in their repetition and diary-wise left me short of material. I took recourse to discussing the books and box sets I was involved with ‚Äì not exactly Pepysian, but it got me through.

Joan Bennett may not be a Hollywood name that readily trips off the tongue. Blame an incident in 1951, when the man she was with, her agent and lover, Jennings Lang, got shot twice ‚Äì once directly in the groin. Before it, Joan was a pioneering film-noir femme fatale, star of the films of Fritz Lang. She‚Äôd also just played Liz Taylor‚Äôs mother in Father of the Bride, and was building a career in TV. After the shooting, her career collapsed, never to fully recover. Lang‚Äôs attacker continued his career much like before. He was the film producer Walter Wanger, Bennett‚Äôs husband, to whom she would stay married for the next 14 years.

                    <span>The ‚Äòforever war‚Äô has finished with a debacle. If this marks the end of American interventionism, what will take its place?
A few months ago there were US bases all over Afghanistan where you could immerse yourself in Americana, buy Coke and Snickers bars from vending machines and watch live sport on TV.
Now the outpost has shrunk to one side of Kabul airport, a chaotic remnant of a 20-year stay where rearguard troops are trying to salvage the last scraps of dignity and honour, seemingly tossed aside by the political leadership in Washington, by trying to extract American stragglers and Afghan allies. Those allies, once inspired by talk of democracy, women‚Äôs rights and the free press, are now faced with the awful life-and-death dilemmas of preserving evidence of their work for or with the US-led coalition, in the hope of last-minute salvation, or destroying it, in a bid to escape execution.

                    <span>Biden‚Äôs Afghan chaos means Europe can no longer rely on him. Let‚Äôs hope a more balanced security relationship emerges
The North Atlantic measurably widened last week. The more Joe Biden tried to shift blame for the Afghan chaos, the bigger the gulf with America‚Äôs UK and European allies grew. This US president, who preaches the virtues of multilateralism yet acted on his own, has done more in a few weeks to undermine the western alliance than Donald Trump ever did with all his bluster.

                    <span>(The Last Music Co)
The late bandleader‚Äôs 70-year career packed in restless shifts of style, virtuoso skill and guest spots from jazz‚Äôs best
When Chris Barber died, aged 90, in March, he had only recently retired after leading a band for 70 years. You can‚Äôt celebrate that with an album and a few notes, especially with music as popular and wide-ranging as his. So what we have here is a package of four CDs and a book tracing Barber‚Äôs career as one track follows another. With its leader playing trombone, and occasionally double bass, Chris Barber‚Äôs Jazz Band combined New Orleans-style traditional jazz with whatever else caught his fancy. The results were sometimes quite spectacular.
The eighth of these 69 tracks, from 1956, has the band‚Äôs banjo player, Lonnie Donegan, singing Rock Island Line with bass and washboard accompaniment. It sparked a nationwide craze for amateur skiffle groups, without which there would have been no Beatles. Unlike other trad bands, Barber‚Äôs never got stuck in a rut. Every record, every tour was a fresh start. As the tracks roll on we hear blues, gospel, ragtime and guest stars such as Louis Jordan, Joe Harriott, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Dr John, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. One late recording, from 2010, features a lively Jools Holland.

                    <span>Renovating this old workhouse is a chance to let a designer‚Äôs imagination run free
As Victorian workhouses go, St Clement‚Äôs in Bow, east London, is unexpectedly beautiful. A grand ode to Italianate architecture, the building, which was also a former psychiatric hospital, is relishing its newfound revival as affordable housing, part of a regeneration project by the Greater London Authority. Just metres from the chaos and traffic of Mile End Road, the elegant courtyard and grounds of St Clement‚Äôs offer a hushed reverence to those living in this vast Grade II listed slice of 19th-century architecture and the sense of community is palpable.
Inside a ground-floor flat, sunlight floods across the sitting room of Tom Bax and his partner Dr Richard Cole, lighting up the bright hues that are painted on each arched window frame. Sculptural lighting, fitting for the elevation of these 19th-century rooms and a rich colourful narrative is interwoven throughout.

                    <span>Stockton-on-Tees is leading a radical rethink of our urban centres, which is now even more urgent as Covid takes its toll
A few months before the pandemic struck, Nigel Cooke found himself under incredulous interrogation at a Local Government Association get-together in Loughborough. As the Stockton-on-Tees councillor responsible for regeneration, it had been Cooke‚Äôs call to buy up a vast shopping centre that has dominated the town‚Äôs high street since the 1970s.
‚ÄúWord had got round that we‚Äôd bought a shopping centre that had come on the market,‚Äù says Cooke. ‚ÄúThe gist of the response from fellow councillors was: ‚ÄòAre you mad? There‚Äôs no future in shopping centres‚Äô. I said: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve not bought it to run as a shopping centre. We‚Äôve bought it to knock it down‚Äô. They said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre even madder than we thought‚Äô. No one had thought of doing what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

                    <span>The road to Tokyo has been hard but the British wheelchair racer is confident she can add to her five Paralympic gold medals
Hannah Cockroft prepared for the Tokyo Paralympics in the best way she knows how: breaking world records. ‚ÄúWait a minute ‚Ä¶‚Äù she says, trying to pull together her performances at the World Para Athletics grand prix in Switzerland. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ so across the four I broke the 100, 200, 400 and 800. But over the four I broke them seven times.‚Äù
Cockroft has consistently been setting the bar ever higher since she announced herself to the world at the 2012 Paralympics. After the London Games she went seven years unbeaten in the four distances she competes at the T34 wheelchair category, winning five Paralympic gold medals. That solitary defeat, to her British teammate Kare Adenegan in 2019, caused her to rethink her approach and launch another period of dominance on the track. To call her a natural-born competitor may be underselling it.

                    <span>With Afghan citizens‚Äô data now in the hands of the Taliban, assumptions about controls that check misuse of intelligence are wide of the mark
In the summer of 2013, shortly after Edward Snowden‚Äôs revelations about the surveillance capabilities of the American National Security Agency (NSA) began to appear, I had a private conversation with a former cabinet minister about the implications of the leaks. At one stage, I mentioned to him a remark attributed to a prime architect of some of the NSA systems ‚Äì that they had taken the US to ‚Äúa keystroke away from totalitarianism‚Äù. The MP scoffed at the idea. What I needed to remember, he told me, in that superior tone that toffs adopt when speaking to their gardeners, was that the US and the UK were ‚Äúmature democracies‚Äù. In such polities, the chances of anyone coming to power who might have the inclination to use such power for sinister purposes was, he said, zero.
Three years later, the US elected Donald Trump. Five years after Trump, look around: an increasing number of democracies are now run by autocrats of various stripes. Think of Orb√°n in Hungary, the Law and Justice party in Poland, Duterte in the Philippines, Erdoƒüan in Turkey, Modi in India, Bolsonaro in Brazil and others in Latin America. None of these autocrats has any scruples about using intelligence collected by state agencies against critics, dissidents and potential opponents. In fact, they positively relish being just a keystroke away from totalitarian control.

Back then, Piketty‚Äôs work on inequality was reported all over the world and sparked soul-searching among elites from Wall Street to Main Street. Some were surprised that Xi was paying attention, too.

                    <span>Director Michael Sarnoski promises a revenge thriller but delivers something much quieter and more profound
A truffle-hunting pig has been kidnapped. Her grizzled owner, Rob (Nicolas Cage), abandons a quiet, off-grid life in the woods and sets out on a recovery mission, chauffeured by a yuppie-ish truffle buyer named Amir (Hereditary‚Äôs Alex Wolff, dressed in pale blue linen and a flashy Gucci belt). It is soon revealed that Rob is a former superstar chef.
Forget the title: this film isn‚Äôt really about a pig. Instead, it‚Äôs an understated indie drama more interested in nostalgia, daddy issues and the restaurant industry in Portland, Oregon. Co-writer and director Michael Sarnoski has an eye for unadorned natural beauty, and Patrick Scola‚Äôs sensual cinematography celebrates the golden light that streams through a kitchen window and the textures of the Pacific north-west‚Äôs autumn foliage. It appears Sarnoski values no-frills authenticity on the plate too, having Rob unleash a haughty diatribe against the pretensions of molecular gastronomy over a dish of scallops ‚Äúbathed in the smoke of Douglas fir cones‚Äù.

I loved the fantasy of acting, the contrast of the worlds in which I lived. It‚Äôs not that one was better, but going from life with not very much to this extravagant, surreal set opened my eyes to possibilities.
Dad was charming and a genius with numbers ‚Äì he was also deep in the organised crime world. In the 60s, he worked with both the Kray twins (Reggie was my brother‚Äôs Godfather) and their arch enemies, the Richardsons. He went to prison quite a few times and Mum would never take us to visit him. Still, he was my dad who I loved deeply.

                    <span>Peer at odds with Priti Patel over climate activists on eve of more protests
A government extremism adviser has admitted during a private meeting that it is wrong to label Extinction Rebellion (XR) supporters as ‚Äúextreme‚Äù, despite the home secretary, Priti Patel, condemning the group as ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù who threaten the nation‚Äôs way of life.
John Woodcock, the former Labour MP who was asked by the Home Office this year to examine disruption and violence by extreme political groups, sought to reassure XR activists that he did not regard the movement as uniformly extreme during a Zoom video conference call last month. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried that I want to label everyone who supports XR as extremists and that is certainly not the case,‚Äù he said.

It was going to be the Pandemic Olympics; the cheerless games that would inspire ambivalence at best. And then sport did its thing. Despite the lack of crowds and the looming threat of Covid, Tokyo was amazing. It also became something else: the mental health Olympics.
When Simone Biles pulled out of the gymnastics events, she brought an unprecedented focus on the psychological challenges of elite sport. One of the greatest athletes of all time had decided to prioritise her mind over the will ‚Äì and enormous pressure ‚Äì to win. ‚ÄúThere is more to life than just gymnastics,‚Äù she said. After taking stock in a Tokyo gym, she returned to the beam event, taking a bronze medal in what might have felt like one of her biggest victories.

If you wanted to launch an overt attack on 30-year-olds, I could think of little better than rebooting Gossip Girl (Wednesday 25 August, 10.35pm, BBC One; all episodes on iPlayer), a series that ran for five years between 2007 and 2012, made stars of Blake Lively, Penn Badgley and Leighton Meester, and introduced an entire generation to the concept of typing something mean very quickly on a BlackBerry. The screaming, crying, skull-cracking sound you can hear in the distance is a generation of original viewers ‚Äì ‚ÄúBut, hold on, they are remaking Gossip Girl? The series of my youth? They are remaking it because ‚Ä¶ 14 years have gone by? Meaning I am no longer ‚Ä¶ young?‚Äù ‚Äì going through a profound existential crisis.

                    <span>Bromley, Kent: How we look at nature is very important. So I decided to look twice at this strange tree
Nature often shows that life and death are intertwined, and I have learned that what is important is how we perceive this. I went for a walk to my local woods. I loved the warm hug of the sun, the smell of refreshing rain-dampened grass and the soothing melodies of the birds. In that moment I was at peace, filled with a feeling of pure happiness and calm. Then I stumbled across a tree in the open field. It made me stop and think. I felt joy and sadness, because half of it was full of life and half was lifeless.
I stared and marvelled at how the tree could balance both life and death, yet still look so beautiful and serene. This made me realise how life and death coexist and that I had a choice to make on how I perceived this scene before me. Taking a deep breath, I looked at the tree again. This time I saw beauty throughout. On one side, the luscious leaves protected a bird‚Äôs nest. But also, the dead branches were serving as a perch for birds, and the hollow trunk was a shelter for small animals and a multitude of insects such as beetles. I saw positivity. What do you see?

A few dark clouds, remnants of the storm that whipped up the North Sea the night before, still hang in the big Lincolnshire skies, above a coastline famed for its kiss-me-quick holiday towns such as Skegness and Mablethorpe. But push on north towards Cleethorpes and the mouth of the Humber, past the caravan parks and imposing sea walls, and the shoreline becomes much wilder, a mix of mud flats and salt marshes, backed by a wide expanse of sand dunes frequented by a few hardy dog walkers.
This is the eastern outpost of Dynamic Dunescapes, a ¬£10m project supported by Natural England and conservation groups including Plantlife and the Wildlife Trusts, which aims to bring new life to sand dunes, with a radical approach to their management.

I went to a wedding at the weekend. That shouldn‚Äôt be a remarkable statement, but of course it is. It‚Äôs been a strange summer: the promise of normal life returning hasn‚Äôt quite materialised. Instead it has felt tentative, cautious. So I wasn‚Äôt sure how this big social event would feel. There was no cap on numbers, no social distancing, no miserable insistence on everything being outside, despite the season‚Äôs atrocious weather. It was a proper wedding, in the old style. And it was wonderful.
After 18 months of deprivation, I forgot what it was like to feel part of a community. Robbed of really celebrating these major life milestones ‚Äì birthdays and anniversaries, births and christenings, weddings and funerals ‚Äì life has felt atomised and dreary. That sense of connection you get from being around other human beings, including those you don‚Äôt know well, has been absent. So a huge, unapologetic, exuberant wedding was always going to be quite the experience.

For Lynton, a small village perched on a picturesque hill overlooking the north Devon coast, this year‚Äôs summer tourist season has been exceptional. Holidaymakers from all over the UK have descended in huge numbers, arriving by coach, by car and on foot.
The scenes are perhaps unsurprising, given how many households have decided against international travel this year when faced with the expense and uncertainty of Covid rules. In July, the Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that an extra ¬£30.5bn and 300,000 jobs would be injected into British travel and hospitality sectors if tourists across Europe switched foreign holidays for domestic ones ‚Äì with Devon one of the biggest recipients of this shift.

                    <span>The singer left one of the most successful girl bands of all time after a decade of relentless trolling. Now, as she prepares to go solo, she reveals why she‚Äôs ready to return to the spotlight on her own terms
Jesy Nelson is having her photo taken. For the first time in her career, it‚Äôs all about her. She is no longer one quarter of the hugely successful girl group Little Mix. Nelson is about to release her first solo single and she says she is happier than she has been in years. But you wouldn‚Äôt know it: she looks painfully self-conscious, unsmiling and anxious.
Photos done, she disappears to change clothes. When she returns, she‚Äôs unrecognisable. Dressed in black T-shirt, leggings and platform trainers, Nelson is all smiles; warm, giggly and uninhibited. I tell her I‚Äôve never seen such a contrast. She laughs. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm in front of a camera, I don‚Äôt know what to do. The other three girls would be in the weirdest positions and look fabulous. If I did it, I‚Äôd look awful.‚Äù

                    <span>Vaccine efficacy against infection is waning slightly with time ‚Äì but efficacy against severe symptoms remains strong
Federal health authorities have recommended booster shots for all adults who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with either the the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, citing evidence that suggests breakthrough infections could become more common over time.
The plan has faced scrutiny. Some US scientists have said data was insufficient to support the decision, and vaccines remain highly effective against severe disease requiring hospitalization and death. The World Health Organization harshly criticized US leaders for using vaccines to provide a third shot to people, even as most around the world haven‚Äôt had one.

For Donald Trump, the former US president, beating the drum of ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù was something of an obsession. ‚ÄúThe future doesn‚Äôt belong to the globalists,‚Äù he once told the UN. ‚ÄúThe future belongs to patriots.‚Äù
Last year, he was rejected by voters in favour of Joe Biden, a committed internationalist who vowed: ‚ÄúAmerica is back.‚Äù Yet the past week has shaken the faith of old allies and led some to question whether a strain of the ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù mantra lives on.

The inscription on the gravestone proudly attests to how far Marcus Venerius Secundio, a former slave of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, went in life. In order of importance, he lists his achievements after being liberated. The first was his role as custodian of the Temple of Venus, built soon after the creation of Pompeii as a Roman colony.
He also joined the ranks of the Augustales, a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship. But perhaps the most telling indication of his eventual status was that he financed entertainment events in Greek and Latin.

How many people have been evacuated from Afghanistan?
At least 12,000 people have been evacuated via Kabul airport since the start of a tumultuous rescue effort last Sunday. They include a mix of western government staff and aid agency workers, as well as Afghan residents who have worked with western governments or their agencies, or are perceived to be particularly at risk due to the nature of their work, such as journalists, translators or human rights activists.

                    <span>Royal Court, London
Dutch singer Wende performs songs conceived by playwrights ‚Äì on topics from bloody battles to online dating ‚Äì with magnetism and a talent for storytelling
In this glorious experiment with mixed results, five playwrights ‚Äì EV Crowe, Sabrina Mahfouz, Somalia Nony√© Seaton, Stef Smith and Debris Stevenson ‚Äì were asked for ideas for songs, the brief no stricter than that. Conceived by Chloe Lamford, the result is an ethereal, mishmashed concert with an always brilliant band and bewitching lead singer, but varied quality of songs and lack of a through-thread.
The show ‚Äì which I see a preview of ‚Äì is meant to be in the much larger auditorium downstairs, but flooding has pushed it to the Court‚Äôs smaller space upstairs. The intimate nature is perfectly suited to the cosy show, with the band clustered in a circle, their instruments almost on top of each other, the audience crowded on three sides. When we‚Äôre encouraged to join in for a chorus (don‚Äôt worry, participation is minimal), there‚Äôs a sense of being gathered round a crackling fire.

                    <span>Wigan 2-26 St Helens
St Helens score four tries in one-sided victory

There has been no shortage of unforgettable performances to settle derby matches between Wigan and St Helens in years gone by. And while this was a comprehensive victory for the reigning Super League champions, the clearest indicator yet about the gulf in class between these two famous clubs at present is that, really, St Helens had to be nowhere near faultless to inflict such an embarrassing defeat on their great rivals.
Wigan‚Äôs inconsistency has haunted them throughout 2021 while the Saints have lost only three games in all competitions as they relentlessly kept up their push for the treble here. But one stat above all else sums up this miserable performance from the Warriors: on the night they received more yellow cards than they scored points.

After the fractured skull and eye socket came the ankle ligament damage. Kevin De Bruyne has spent the summer being hurt, returning from injury and playing through the pain barrier.
His Premier League campaign began as his Euro 2020 ended, with De Bruyne a fitness doubt. He made a swifter-than-expected recovery ‚Äì another recurring theme ‚Äì to play for the last 12 minutes in Sunday‚Äôs defeat at Tottenham. But he missed training on Friday, leaving Pep Guardiola unsure if his talisman will face Norwich on Saturday. The Etihad Stadium will be packed for the first time since a De Bruyne masterclass against West Ham in February 2020, but he may be a spectator as his stop-start year continues. He is becoming a constant concern.

                    <span>Liverpool hope to reward Egypt international‚Äôs prolific form
‚ÄòI am involved in pretty much everything in club,‚Äô manager says

J√ºrgen Klopp has confirmed talks are under way on a new contract for Mohamed Salah as Liverpool look to reward the Egypt international‚Äôs prolific form and end speculation over his Anfield future.
The 29-year-old has two seasons remaining on his current contract, an incentivised deal worth up to ¬£200,000 a week, and would be expected to receive a significant increase given his influence on the team and his global status. Liverpool have secured Virgil van Dijk, Alisson, Fabinho and Trent Alexander-Arnold on new long-term extensions recently and Klopp said last week that he expects Jordan Henderson, the captain, to follow suit. The Liverpool manager has confirmed he is also involved in efforts to extend Salah‚Äôs hugely successful Anfield career.

The French government‚Äôs readout of the conversation was released on Friday, a day after the call took place, and indicates that Macron emphasised ensuring the safe evacuation of Afghan citizens who assisted American and European troops over the past 20 years at great risk to themselves and their families.

                    <span>Resistance to measures to limit disease spread are part of history. How extreme they are depends on what leaders do, and what they allow
In the pandemic‚Äôs second year, a transnational, conspiracy-minded protest movement is becoming more vocal, and in some cases more violent, in pushing back on measures to limit the spread of new variants of the Covid-19 virus. False beliefs about the vaccines and the virus can now spread worldwide on the internet at the speed of thought. For this reason, many have pointed to online disinformation as the motor of of antivax protests.
That may be so but in other ways the protesters are following patterns which have been observed throughout recorded human history, which has seen civilisations rise and fall to the rhythm of novel epidemics.

It‚Äôs a blustery Wellington night and we‚Äôre on the brink of the second nationwide lockdown of the pandemic. There‚Äôs a measured knock at my flat door. Jemaine Clement shakes my hand warmly and removes his boots. We‚Äôre meeting off the back of the global success of his comedy series Wellington Paranormal and he is in an ebullient mood. He‚Äôs also in a thirsty one: tonight the former door-to-door orange juice salesman is plumping for copious glasses of water instead. 
Paranormal is one of two spinoffs from his and Taika Waititi‚Äôs vampire film What We Do in the Shadows. It stars Shadows‚Äô police officers Minogue (Mike Minogue) and O‚ÄôLeary (Karen O‚ÄôLeary), recruited for the paranormal unit by Sgt Ruawai Maaka (Maaka Pohatu). The trio, and their colleague Const Parker (Tom Sainsbury), are oblivious, bungling and affable. Clement explains the importance of Paranormal being a collegial shoot.

The straw that appears to have broken the camel‚Äôs back could scarcely have been more innocuous. On the first Sunday of October 2017, Phil Jones tweeted a reply to Simon Wood, a Masterchef-winning restaurateur who had used Twitter to flag up the presence of the Manchester United defender in his premises earlier that evening. ‚ÄúFantastic food,‚Äù wrote Phil, by way of acknowledgement for the shout-out. ‚ÄúMe and the wife will be back soon. Thank you.‚Äù
It was in keeping with the kind of mundane to and fro in which Jones occasionally engaged on a social media account that seemed to be curated by the player himself rather than a team of in-house social media strategists. Promotional tweets, presumably posted at the behest of his sponsors Adidas, were occasionally punctuated by birthday greetings and other supportive messages for strangers and colleagues alike. Not the kind of content a man would expect to get his two million followers exercised.

Between August 2020 and July 2021, the rainforest lost 10.476 square kilometers ‚Äì an area nearly seven times bigger than greater London and 13 times the size of New York City, according to data released by Imazon, a Brazilian research institute that has been tracking the Amazon deforestation since 2008. The figure is 57% higher than in the previous year and is the worst since 2012.

A radio reporter in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz has been shot and killed, becoming at least the fifth Mexican journalist to be murdered in the country this year.
Jacinto Romero Flores, who covered politics and crime in the municipality of Zongolica, was shot dead in the township of Ixtaczoquitl√°n on Thursday.

                    <span>Car salesman Paul Drummond lets American slip into gear
England‚Äôs Georgia Hall shares halfway lead with Mina Harigae

It doesn‚Äôt seem to have been much of a hardship for Paul Drummond to take a week off from his family‚Äôs car sales business in Carnoustie. Drummond, a 31-year-old plus-two handicap who caddies at the championship links in his spare time, finds himself on the bag for Lexi Thompson at the Women‚Äôs Open. The spontaneous alliance is working a treat thus far; Thompson added a 70 to Thursday‚Äôs 69 to ease into contention on the Angus coast. Drummond, in branded gear, looks every bit the tour caddie.
Thompson‚Äôs regular looper, Jack Fulghum, was unwell amid severe heat at the Olympics. It appears the partnership may have formally ended in any case. Thompson made contact with the Carnoustie caddie master last weekend, with Drummond duly recommended for the highest-profile role of his ‚Äúother‚Äù job. Even the language barrier has delivered no problems. ‚ÄúHe speaks very slowly to me,‚Äù said the Floridian Thompson of her Scottish assistant. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fully trusting him on his numbers and whether to hit it left or right of the pin and he has been spot on.‚Äù

                    <span>Painter of huge portraits that explored the relationship between painting and photography
In the 1960s Chuck Close, fresh from art school, was sitting in a New York restaurant when Jasper Johns walked in, passing by his fellow diners in total anonymity despite the older painter‚Äôs great fame. After seven decades of self-portraits, Close, who has died aged 81, never suffered the same fate, his face recognisable to generations of museum-goers. In 2017 this storied career abruptly ended following sexual misconduct allegations.
Close painted on a huge scale, the acrylics or oils flatly applied with little discernible brushstrokes. He always started with a photograph as source material, rigidly divided by an overlaid grid, which he would replicate, colours and forms, square by square, on to canvas using a variety of tools including razorblades, electric drills and airbrushes. The artist also brought the faces of his peers from obscurity, completing portraits of Kiki Smith, Alex Katz, Cindy Sherman, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists, as well as the more readily recognisable Barack Obama, Al Gore, Brad Pitt and Kate Moss.

The Kabul airport gates were a path not to escape but to hospital for one Afghan human rights activist this week.
A relative was shot in the head in the melee of people trying to leave, and so she spent the evening trudging to a market to buy alcohol and gauze for his wounds. The hospital had run out.

The Plymouth gunman was not charged or cautioned after he carried out a vicious assault in a city park last year, but instead was allowed to take part in a four-month rehabilitation scheme, it has emerged.
Jake Davison‚Äôs legally held shotgun was confiscated after he began the Pathfinder scheme and a worker from it found out he had the weapon and informed Devon and Cornwall police. But the shotgun was handed back last month after he finished the programme.

                    <span>Vast disparities in income may have lost some of their power to shock. But they remain a gross injustice
Public anger about the vast salaries extracted from business by the highest-paid people surfaces less often than one might expect, given highly conspicuous levels of inequality and rising poverty. Sir Philip Green and Fred Goodwin are rare in having become notorious big earners: Sir Philip because of the collapse of BHS, as well as his own inflated rewards and oligarchic lifestyle; Mr Goodwin because he exemplified a greedy banker type at a time when anger at banks was at its peak.
More recently, a colossal ¬£75m bonus paid to the chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, resulted in his departure from the business. But Mr Fairburn ‚Äì who was reported earlier this year to have failed to keep a promise to set up a charity ‚Äì did not become a household name.

Dominic Raab appears to have been saved this week by Boris Johnson‚Äôs exceptionally high threshold for sacking ministers. For now, the foreign secretary has joined the reshuffle waiting room, sitting in ministerial limbo alongside Gavin Williamson and Priti Patel.
The prime minister has faced pressure from within his own party as well as from the opposition to remove them all ‚Äì over Williamson‚Äôs failure on exams for two years in a row, the finding that Patel bullied staff, and Raab‚Äôs ill-advised holiday at the height of an international crisis.

                    <span>The past year has rightly shifted the way that cultural value is estimated
In living memory, there has been no worse year for museums and galleries, along with many other arts organisations. With closure forced on them by the pandemic, they were unable to earn money from ticket sales, shops or cafes; when they reopened for a time last summer, and again this spring, they had to cope with reduced footfall and the costs of expensive interventions to render them Covid-safe. Some of their funders, especially local authorities, have suffered gravely too, with cuts at times passed on.
The Museums Prize, run by the charity Art Fund, has a distinguished history of rewarding excellence in British institutions. Often in the past the focus has been on multimillion-pound, attention-grabbing capital projects. The past two years, though, have seen a shift in the focus of the prize ‚Äì one that may portend a wider change of emphasis in how cultural value is estimated. In 2020, the prize, which was already in process when the pandemic hit, was split between the shortlisted candidates, the prize money having been doubled to ¬£200,000. This year, entrants were asked three simple questions: what did you do that showed imagination and determination? How do you think this made a difference? How will you build on this in the future?

                    <span>Literary prize culture favours young and marketable writers ‚Äì and the new Futures scheme is simply adding to the problem
Last week, the Women‚Äôs prize announced a new award in partnership with Good Housekeeping magazine. ‚ÄúFutures‚Äù will provide promotional support to 10 female writers of fiction in the UK and Ireland who have published one book. The award, however, has an age limit of 35.
It‚Äôs great to encourage young writers, so what‚Äôs the problem? The arts world is already deluged with age-limited awards. Big prizes include the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year award (for under-35s), the Dylan Thomas (for under-39s) and the Rooney prize (for under-40s) in Ireland. There are also a host of smaller age-limited grants, residencies and other opportunities, not to mention publicity campaigns similar to Futures, such a Granta‚Äôs Best Young British Novelists (for under-40s) and their Best Young Spanish Novelists (who, for some reason, have to make it even faster, by the age of 35). The assumption, it seems, is that older writers are so culturally or financially secure that they have no need for money or recognition.

                    <span>Readers respond to a feature on women forced out of work by menopause and a report on suggestions that menopause should be a protected characteristic under the Equality Act
Middle-aged women and others going through the menopause experience unacceptable discrimination. However, the law as it stands means legal cases challenging menopause-related discrimination need to be brought on grounds of sex, age or disability.
If the law currently works inadequately, should menopause be added to the list of grounds recognised by the Equality Act 2010 (Equality laws could be changed to protect women in menopause, says MP, 18 August)? In our view, menopause-based discrimination highlights instead the relevance and value of an ‚Äúintersectional‚Äù approach. This recognises that discrimination is often due to a combination of social biases. Kimberl√© Crenshaw, who developed the term in the late 1980s, focused on the disadvantages that black women faced and the inadequate response of American anti-discrimination law to their experiences.

                    <span>The legacy of Boris Johnson‚Äôs initial approach to the pandemic can be measured in lives needlessly lost and ruined, says Michael Rosen
Your report on US officials‚Äô reaction to Boris Johnson‚Äôs initial coronavirus policy, to aim for herd immunity (Trump team thought UK officials ‚Äòout of their minds‚Äô aiming for herd immunity, book says, 19 August), confirms what many of us have been saying for some time. If we follow the timeline of what he said and did in the months leading up to the first lockdown of 16 March last year, we can indeed see quite clearly that herd immunity was the first go-to policy.
Some examples: Johnson saying on 3 February that he was against ‚Äúmarket segregation‚Äù as a way of dealing with the coronavirus ‚Äì in other words, he was against a government-led intervention policy that might hamper trade. Later, on 3 March, he described how safe it was to shake hands with Covid patients and said that he would go on doing so. On 12 March, Robert Peston, presumably armed with his usual first-hand knowledge, wrote in the Spectator how herd immunity was the policy of the day. As late as 13 March, government scientists, speaking on BBC Two‚Äôs Newsnight and Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme, spoke openly of herd immunity as being the inevitable or necessary approach.

The ¬£7bn offer is ¬£300m more than the ¬£6.7bn on the table from rival suitor‚Äôs Fortress but the share price move suggests the winner may have to dig even deeper as that 6p equates to more than ¬£150m.

More than 9,000 Covid infections were linked to Euro 2020 football games monitored for the government‚Äôs mass events test scheme, and scientists have said the tournament generated ‚Äúa significant risk to public health‚Äù.
An analysis of the third and final stage of the research programme, released on Friday, found that more than 85% of all the infections connected to the 49 days of various outdoor sport, music and entertainment events came from the eight Euros games involved, and mainly the semi-final and final.

Jonnie Peacock has a new look for 2021. His blond hair is no longer in a nice schoolboy short back and sides, but tied in an unruly topknot. He has a wiry beard to go with it too. He looks less like he‚Äôs about to challenge for a third consecutive sprint title at the Paralympics, than lead a horde of Vikings on a spot of light pillaging.

                    <span>Face blindness meant the photorealist artist, who has died aged 81, had to dismantle and reconstitute, making every cell of his pixellated portraits ever more dramatic

Chuck Close, painter of outsized photorealist portraits, dies aged 81

Hugely enlarged, Chuck Close stares back at you from behind his glasses, a cigarette lodged in the corner of his mouth. It is a face with a what-you-looking-at stare, and you look back, dwarfed by his image, thinking get-out-of-my-face in return.
Taking us from the top of his head to his sprouting chest hair, via every pore and bristle, the artist‚Äôs unkempt anti-grooming and non-coiffure, the trickle of smoke exhaled from his nostril, Close‚Äôs 1967-8 Big Self-Portrait charts every centimetre of his black and white photograph, which was gridded, enlarged and copied on to the canvas, then painted using a spray gun. All the aberrations of the original photograph, with its blank background and out-of-focus ear, are retained in the painting. The tip of the smouldering cigarette looms out at you. It makes you want to duck. Painted when Close was in his late 20s, the self-portrait was Close‚Äôs big move, both calling card and confrontation.

Spain has offered itself as the EU‚Äôs hub to take in Afghans who have collaborated with its institutions over the years, as Germany said there was an emerging consensus within the bloc to also ease passage for a limited number of other people in need of protection from Taliban reprisals.
However, migration experts warned that the vast majority of Afghan citizens already displaced by the fighting that brought the new regime to power will be left stranded unless European states proactively work to negotiate a safe corridor out of the country.

                    <span>Our battle to restore a statement to a Manchester exhibition was really about what can and can‚Äôt be said in cultural spaces
On Wednesday, protesters in Manchester reclaimed one of the city‚Äôs main cultural institutions. Despite the rain, pro-Palestine activists gathered in front of the closed doors of the Whitworth gallery, part of the University of Manchester. It was because of their persistent action, and 13,000 letters sent to the gallery, that part of our exhibition, a printed statement titled ‚ÄúForensic Architecture stands with Palestine‚Äù, has been reinstated. The exhibition, which we insisted be shut as a result of the statement‚Äôs unilateral removal, has now reopened.
On Sunday 15 August, a blog post on the website of UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) announced that, following the group‚Äôs intervention, the statement had been removed from our exhibition, Cloud Studies. When we first heard of the news, we were not altogether surprised. The same group had already criticised a statement of solidarity with Palestinians published on the Whitworth‚Äôs website in June, and succeeded in convincing the university to have it removed. And this was hardly UKLFI‚Äôs first attack on us as an organisation. In 2018, when we were nominated for the Turner prize, UKLFI urged the Tate not to award the prize to us on the outrageous grounds that documents that we had published in relation to Palestine amounted to ‚Äúmodern blood libels likely to promote antisemitism and attacks on Jews‚Äù.

The ongoing disaster in Afghanistan is only the latest fiasco to provoke fury at the unseriousness of Boris Johnson‚Äôs government. In fact, for the past 20 years British and American conservatism has seemed ever more unrealistic: its policies ever more like fantasies, its relationship with the truth ever looser, its leaders ever less focused and competent.
This persistent unrealism has had terrible costs. And yet, without seeming to have mastered the basics of governing, conservatives still win plenty of elections, and dominate how politics is talked and thought about. To many voters and commentators, conservative government, however much it fails in practice, is still the realistic option.

The mechanisms of pop stardom have never been subject to as much scrutiny as they are now. Britney Spears‚Äô conservatorship struggle exposed their potential for (alleged) abuse. Raye recently split from her major label, Polydor, after she reached breaking point and shared her frustrations about not being allowed to release her debut album despite signing in 2014 and helming numerous massive hit singles. Former X Factor winner Rebecca Ferguson has called for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged widespread music industry wrongdoing. That labels should root out exploitative and predatory behaviour and protect exposed young stars is a baseline requirement. But increasingly it seems that the existential state of pop stardom ‚Äì particularly for young women, subject to greater scrutiny than their male peers and often held to contradictory standards ‚Äì is intolerable beyond any level of protection.

There‚Äôs still something inside me that knows it‚Äôs a Games year. Even though I last competed at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, it‚Äôs almost like my body has become attuned to being ready.

I have a sense of excitement as the Games approaches, but ‚Äì fortunately ‚Äì I don‚Äôt have any of the pressures; the pressures of qualifying for the Games and now of making sure you‚Äôre ready for them. It‚Äôs about this point in the buildup that athletes start to really worry. You‚Äôre trying to get your form right. But you‚Äôre also paranoid about getting injured, and about staying away from anyone who might have a cold. This year, of course, there is Covid to think of too. You catch that, you‚Äôre potentially out of the Games or even worse. I can‚Äôt imagine what it must be like getting ready for Tokyo right now, people must have wrapped themselves in cotton wool.

                    <span>Metropolitan police vow to tackle ‚Äòwilful obstruction‚Äô in spite of supreme court‚Äôs Ziegler judgment
Police preparing for a new campaign of Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests in London have said they will not be deterred by a recent supreme court ruling that obstruction can be a legitimate and lawful form of protest.
The Ziegler judgment, handed down by the supreme court in June, had ruled that the exercising of protest rights could constitute a ‚Äúlawful excuse‚Äù for obstructing the highway, even if the protest is considered disruptive.

Protests have erupted in Pakistan‚Äôs port city Gwadar against a severe shortage of water and electricity and threats to livelihoods, part of a growing backlash against China‚Äôs multibillion-dollar belt and road projects in the country.
This week, demonstrators including fishers and other local workers blocked the roads in Gwadar, a coastal town in Balochistan. They burned tyres, chanted slogans and largely shut down the city, to demand water and electricity and a stop to Chinese trawlers illegally fishing in the nearby waters and then taking the fish to China. Two people were injured when the authorities cracked down on the protesters.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

About nine in 10 people in the UK are still wearing face coverings at least some of the time despite them no longer being compulsory, official figures show.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) data suggests face coverings in some settings could be one of the Covid-enforced changes to daily life in the UK that remain after the pandemic has subsided.

My wife and I have decided to move with our two young sons to her home country. It was a difficult decision and we spent a long time making it, but we believe it‚Äôs an opportunity for a better life that we have to take now.
My mother-in-law is not well and we have not seen my wife‚Äôs family for two years. However, my parents are struggling to accept our decision. They doubt the wisdom of the move, and initially took the view that my wife had pressured me into going. My wife found this hurtful; especially that my parents did not appreciate why she might want to spend time with her own mother. I was also infuriated by the notion that I was incapable of making such a momentous decision with my eyes open ‚Äì and in support of my wife. I have kept all this from my parents because I do not want conflict and to leave in such an atmosphere.

Wes Streeting can‚Äôt claim to be his inner-city comp‚Äôs most famous alumni. That claim goes to the Hollywood actor John Boyega who, like the shadow child poverty secretary, also came from a council estate and went on to Westminster City school, which was in special measures during Streeting‚Äôs time.
Now, Streeting says, opportunities are rapidly diminishing for state school pupils like them. His own school has had to make hard choices about funding extracurricular activities, meaning after-school drama there ‚Äì despite its Star Wars-famed alumnus ‚Äì has been a casualty.

Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement would make it ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù for the UK government to refuse a second independence referendum but environmental campaigners expressed disappointment that the text fell short of calling for an immediate end to oil and gas exploration.

With reports of the Taliban going door to door searching for people who worked with the former Afghan government or western countries, claims have also emerged of Taliban fighters torturing and killing members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan after overrunning their village last month.

What are workers‚Äô rights if they are asked to go back?


As the pandemic struck wealthy economies in early 2020, workers (in white-collar jobs, at least) found themselves carrying out their duties from home. Now that vaccination programmes are continuing apace, more companies are grappling with how ‚Äì and whether ‚Äì to end the great enforced experiment in home working.
The answer is far from settled, with Apple telling its global workforce on Friday that they will not return to its corporate offices until January at the earliest, amid concern over the spread of new coronavirus variants. The tech company‚Äôs original plan to bring staff back in on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays in a hybrid home-working pattern had already been delayed from early September to October.

                    <span>Uncorrected proofs of upcoming novels have been selling for large sums on eBay and Depop ‚Äì despite the practice being banned by publishers
When advance reading copies (ARCs) of Sally Rooney‚Äôs new novel Beautiful World, Where Are You were sent out in May, there was a flurry of social media posts. A lucky selection of editors, writers and influencers flaunted their copies; others bemoaned not having been granted one. Soon listings for proof copies (which are clearly marked ‚Äúnot for resale‚Äù) started to appear on trading sites such as eBay and Depop. One copy, listed on eBay by a seller in North Carolina, sold in June for $209.16. Even the canvas tote bag that Rooney‚Äôs publicists had been sending out with the ARC copies was fetching prices in the region of $80. And this growing market for unpublished novels is not just a product of Rooney-mania: Jonathan Franzen‚Äôs Crossroads, which will be published in October,  sold earlier this month on eBay for $124.
Advance copies of popular and classic novels have long been collector‚Äôs items. A rare proof copy of JK Rowling‚Äôs Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, for example, or classics by authors such as Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck can sell for up to ¬£30,000. But this high demand for ARCs of books that are yet to be published has only emerged recently, fuelled in part by the rise of book bloggers and influencers.

Newbies on the tiller have an obvious tell: they zig-zag down the canal. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt give time for the boat to respond to their steer ‚Äì it does take a moment. Bear this in mind, be patient and avoid oversteering. Remember you moor, rather than park the boat, and the canalside is a towpath, not the ‚Äúbank‚Äù. Put time into planning your route: working out where to finish every day (preferably by a pub), building in contingencies in case of rain or other hold-ups, as well as things to do on land and, for trips longer than a weekend, water points. Embrace the change of pace and give yourself over fully to the way of the canals, where 4mph is top speed! Let getting to the pub on time or finding a good mooring spot be your priorities and try to leave everything else at home. David Lawrence, civil servant, London

Rain has fallen on the summit of Greenland‚Äôs huge ice cap for the first time on record. Temperatures are normally well below freezing on the 3,216-metre (10,551ft) peak, and the precipitation is a stark sign of the climate crisis.
Scientists at the US National Science Foundation‚Äôs summit station saw rain falling throughout 14 August but had no gauges to measure the fall because the precipitation was so unexpected. Across Greenland, an estimated 7bn tonnes of water was released from the clouds.

                    <span>MPs call for inquiry into suitability of Sheffield hotel where guests had raised concern about safety of windows
The Home Office did not carry out any safety checks on the hotel where a five-year-old Afghan boy fell to his death, the Guardian has learned, amid calls for an independent inquiry into the suitability of his accommodation.
Mohammed Munib Majeedi died on Wednesday after falling out of a ninth-floor window at the OYO Metropolitan hotel in Sheffield city centre. He and his family had been placed in the hotel by the Home Office as part of a scheme to relocate Afghans who had helped the British embassy or army in Afghanistan.

A tsunami of electric vehicles is expected in rich countries, as car companies and governments pledge to ramp up their numbers ‚Äì there are predicted be 145m on the roads by 2030. But while electric vehicles can play an important role in reducing emissions, they also contain a potential environmental timebomb: their batteries.
By one estimate, more than 12m tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030.

                    <span>The EU and its members have already adopted hardline policies that make an Afghan refugee crisis unlikely
As the fallout from Afghanistan continues, EU leaders are working themselves into a frenzy over the risk of a replay of the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis. At a news conference in Berlin on Monday, Armin Laschet, Angela Merkel‚Äôs likely successor, argued: ‚ÄúWe should not send the signal that Germany can take in everyone in need. The focus must be on humanitarian aid on site, unlike in 2015.‚Äù Though the French president, Emmanuel Macron, recognised Europe‚Äôs duty to take in some of the ‚Äúrights defenders, artists, journalists and campaigners who are now threatened‚Äù, it came with a major caveat. ‚ÄúEurope cannot face the consequences of the current situation on its own. We must anticipate and protect ourselves against sizeable flows of irregular migration,‚Äù he said in a press briefing.
Their concerns obscure the reality that the EU and its member states have spent years taking hardline measures to reduce irregular migration. This will prevent a rerun of 2015, when more than 1.2 million refugees sought asylum within the EU (0.16% of Europe‚Äôs total population), sparking political opposition based on the supposed threat that these people posed to the EU.

After wine and canapes on a patio overlooking high-rises and greenery in an affluent part of Lagos, 15 guests assemble inside. They sit facing one another across a long dining table, brightly lit by a steel row of low-hanging lights. Nigerian cultural masks and artworks adorn the walls of the restaurant, which evokes a Nigerian home.
The dishes emerge: traditional egusi soup, but with the efo (spinach) crisp amaranth leaves. Grains of gari, or cassava root, typically pounded to make a kind of dough called eba, is instead lightly dusted over it. Unusually, there are croutons. ‚ÄúAn egusi crouton,‚Äù a guest nods approvingly.

In 2014, I returned to my place of birth in Melbourne, Australia, to visit family. The 32-hour slog to the other side of the globe was uncomfortable, but it was nothing compared with what awaited me on the ground.
One night, the uncle with whom I was staying went to Tasmania to visit friends. Suddenly, place transformed into a horror house. It was about 9pm, the sun was leaving the horizon and the lawn, which had been baked into straw, was getting a much-needed reprieve. Sweat had welded my polyester shirt so tightly to my back that it almost took my spine with it when I finally managed to peel it off.

When the broadcaster, author and journalist Sarfraz Manzoor started his career, he wrote mostly about the British Muslim experience. But doing this soon grew to feel reductive. Editors would shoehorn his Muslim identity into pieces that were not about religion, or ask him to comment on Pakistani politics as if he were an international relations scholar, rather than the son of working-class immigrants who settled in Luton in the 1970s.
‚ÄúI felt like people like me were given a postage stamp sized space in which to operate,‚Äù says Manzoor. Which is why, after the publication of his 2007 memoir Greetings from Bury Park, subsequently adapted into the 2019 film Blinded By the Light, he moved on to other topics. He presented documentaries for Radio 4 on everything from Little Richard and test cricket to George Harrison.

The tweet announcing the arrival of acche din was more than a euphoric proclamation of this electoral victory.

                    <span>British MPs have turned on Boris Johnson ‚Äì but what tidy end did they expect from this imperialist experiment?
Britain‚Äôs MPs this week uttered one long howl of anguish over Afghanistan. Their immediate targets were Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, politicians who just happened to be on the watch when Kabul‚Äôs pack of cards collapsed. But their real concern was that a collective 20-year experiment in ‚Äúexporting western values‚Äù to Afghanistan had fallen into chaos. MPs wanted someone other than themselves to blame. A politician is never so angry as when proved wrong.

Sophie Carrigill has played wheelchair basketball all over the world for Team GB. She‚Äôs been an Olympic torchbearer, won a string of medals and captained her country. But nothing means quite as much as the prospect of Paralympic gold.
In 2016, Carrigill and her team finished a brilliant ‚Äì but agonising ‚Äì fourth place at the Rio Games. Now she wants to get on the podium, but the sport she loves has already changed her life. She tells Nosheen Iqbal the remarkable story of her journey from a life-changing accident as a teenager to realising how talented she was, and now a chance of glory at what could be the peak of her career. And she reflects on how much the perception of disability sport has changed since she started out, and how far there still is to go.

Almost half the world‚Äôs 2.2 billion children are already at ‚Äúextremely high risk‚Äù from the impacts of the climate crisis and pollution, according to a report from Unicef. The UN agency‚Äôs head called the situation ‚Äúunimaginably dire‚Äù.
Nearly every child around the world was at risk from at least one of these impacts today, including heatwaves, floods, cyclones, disease, drought, and air pollution, the report said. But 1 billion children live in 33 countries facing three or four impacts simultaneously. The countries include India, Nigeria and the Philippines, and much of sub-Saharan Africa.

Arsenal beat Chelsea twice last season, including a victory at Stamford
Bridge three months ago. Since then they have spent heavily on transfers that include a ¬£50m centre-back. Their fans must be super-confident as they prepare for Sunday‚Äôs Emirates clash, especially those who have blanked out last week‚Äôs fiasco at Brentford. But Thomas Tuchel is sure to bear that match in mind as he prepares his strategy for Sunday, and his pre-match pep talk is likely to begin with a good old-fashioned ‚Äúget into ‚Äôem‚Äù. Ben White performed no worse than many teammates last week but the expectation on him is higher following his transfer, so he needs to earn back some trust by rising to Sunday‚Äôs challenge, which will be particularly formidable if a highly motivated and supremely confident Romelu Lukaku is given the first start in his second coming at Chelsea. Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, needs to pick a balanced lineup and find a way to inspire some oomph. There are only so many more humiliations Arsenal can suffer before the manager gets the heave-ho. PD

John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their one-year-old daughter, Muji, and their dog were found dead on a hiking trail in Mariposa county. A family friend had reported them missing Monday evening.

Joe Biden has said that he and first lady Jill Biden plan on getting a booster shot and is comfortable doing so while millions around the world remain unvaccinated because America has ‚Äúprovided more to the rest of the world than all the rest of the world combined‚Äù.
He added that the US will also provide an additional half a billion shots around the world within the first half of next year. Critics argue this remains a drop in the ocean in the context of what is needed.

In early 2020 the south Pacific country was forced to close its borders to keep Covid-19 out. In doing so it shut the doors on an industry that contributes two-thirds of the remote island country‚Äôs GDP.

On one of the worst mornings it was the arrest of 53 campaigners, politicians and activists, many of them Wong‚Äôs friends, for having the gall to hold a pre-election poll.

Captain Carlson scores 82 in Glamorgan‚Äôs victory

Kiran Carlson looks like Joaquin Phoenix might if he ever took on happy roles. And maybe, if Hollywood ever decides to make a sports movie about Glamorgan‚Äôs Royal London One-Day Cup win, Phoenix will finally have one.
Don‚Äôt tell the Glamorgan captain that this competition doesn‚Äôt mean much any more. You could see how much it meant as he tracked the ball, flying from Liam Trevaskis‚Äôs bat into the hands of Nick Selman. Carlson was right next to him as the catch landed, and right on top of him a second later; the score was 238 for nine, and Carlson could finally be sure that Durham‚Äôs hopes were extinguished.

In short, this was a performance Rob Burrow would have been incredibly proud of. Burrow was renowned for many things as a player but whether it was then, during his glittering on-field career, or now, as he takes on his biggest fight of all with Motor Neurone Disease, you have always been guaranteed fight and spirit from the 38-year-old.
How the club he holds so close to his heart channelled those traits here to keep their hopes of a ninth Super League title alive. On the night Burrow was present as Leeds‚Äô guest of honour, you felt everyone in attendance were steeled for an emotional evening. But as the words began to stream from the app which now helps Burrow communicate, it was impossible not to be moved.

Harry Kane not involved as Spurs labour to first-leg loss

If Tottenham really want to reach the Europa Conference League group stage, it might be time to call upon a top-class centre-forward. Pa√ßos de Ferreira deserved this win over a scratch selection, a first-half goal from Lucas Silva ensuring there was at least something to remember of a thoroughly tedious match. Even so, the Portuguese side were certainly not good enough to suggest a fully firing Harry Kane would have problems putting them away if picked for next week‚Äôs second leg; continued participation in this competition might be bittersweet as parting shots go, though, and there was certainly little indication in a featureless showing that Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo would lose sleep over an early exit.

Several people have been killed after Taliban fighters shot at crowds waving the national flag at an independence day rally, as protests erupted across Afghanistan in a sign of the dissent the Taliban may face as they attempt to govern.
At Kabul airport, chaos continued, preventing dozens of those eligible for evacuation by Britain from being able to reach the rescue aircraft. The Taliban maintained a heavy presence on the airport‚Äôs approaches and, in desperate scenes, babies were passed to US soldiers in the hope of giving them a life outside the country.

                    <span>Foreign secretary‚Äôs position ‚Äòuntenable‚Äô after claims he made himself unavailable on holiday as Afghanistan fell
Dominic Raab is facing increasing pressure to resign, including from some of his own party‚Äôs MPs, after claims he effectively disappeared for more than a week while on holiday during the collapse of Afghanistan, delegating almost all duties to juniors.
Raab‚Äôs department did not deny he asked another minister to make a call on Friday to assist the evacuation of former British military translators while he was in Crete. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and SNP demanded Boris Johnson sack his foreign secretary if he did not decide to quit.

                    <span>Cheap money, the Delta variant and China‚Äôs sluggish performance add up to tough times ahead
Financial markets these days react to any whiff of tighter monetary policy in the US, so a little drama on Thursday was par for the course after the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs minutes suggested the winding-down of the huge pandemic stimulus programme could start soon. The Fed will still be buying assets in the autumn, but maybe not at the rate of $120bn (¬£89bn) a month. Commodities fell and shares globally took a hit. The FTSE 100 index dropped 1.5%.
Context is needed, of course. The Footsie had risen by 25% in a straight line, more or less, since the arrival of vaccines last November. If one goes back further to the start of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500, the main US index, has roughly doubled from its low point. So the odd percentage decline hardly shows up on a medium-term view.

Most of the 125-strong team of security personnel, employed by the global security firm GardaWorld, have been given informal notice that they no longer have jobs guarding the embassy, several said.

The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is facing calls to urge MPs to wear masks in the chamber, after cabinet ministers and many Tory backbenchers shunned the advice during a packed eight-hour debate on Afghanistan.
Although face coverings stopped being mandatory in most settings on 19 July, government guidance that face coverings should be work in ‚Äúcrowded and enclosed spaces‚Äù remains in place, and rules set down by the parliamentary authorities say they should be worn in the main debating space.

US officials thought their British counterparts ‚Äúwere out of their minds‚Äù in aiming for herd immunity as part of Boris Johnson‚Äôs initial policy on dealing with the coronavirus, according to a new book about the global response to the pandemic.
As the scale of the threat became increasingly clear in January and February 2020, officials in Donald Trump‚Äôs administration were trying to convince him to take the threat seriously, despite personal reassurances he had been given by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that it was under control.

With the Taliban now firmly in control of most of Afghanistan, British government figures have been wrestling with what that means for everything from counter-terrorism to the drugs trade and aid.
How soon should Britain‚Äôs battlefield foes be recognised as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan? What attitude should the UK take to the burgeoning resistance coalescing around former Afghan government figures as the threat of renewed civil war looms?

                    <span>After years of cuts, the pandemic has left social services and the young people they support brutally exposed 
About the only good thing that can be said about the worsening crisis in children‚Äôs social care is that it is being talked about. The extremely serious consequences of the pandemic for some of the most vulnerable children in the UK were predictable. To an extent, these risks were taken on board by policymakers, for example when they decreed that schools would remain open for those deemed to be in need of support.
But a year and a half into the pandemic, it is clear that children who rely on local authorities for some aspects of their care, if not all of it, have been left horribly exposed. Guardian reporting has uncovered huge increases in referrals to social services, children being taken into care, and notifications related to domestic abuse and exploitation. In Middlesbrough, for example, referrals rose 40%, while the former children‚Äôs commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is so worried about grooming by criminal gangs that she is launching an independent inquiry.

                    <span>The UK should never have joined the US invasion, writes Dr Taj Hargey, and its reputation is being stained by America‚Äôs unilateral retreat. Plus letters from Jonathan Worthington and Sandra Khadhouri
In Wednesday‚Äôs revelatory parliamentary debates there was hardly any mention of the opportunist architects of the failed British involvement in Afghanistan (Tories rebuke Boris Johnson over ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô Afghanistan failure, 18 August). Tony Blair and his new Labour clique blindly followed a retributive George Bush in invading and occupying Afghanistan. The ultimate blame for the UK‚Äôs futile 20-year presence there must be levelled at the slavishly pro-American New Labour party. Why did Blair, Jack Straw, Peter Mandelson and other complicit Labour figures buy in to the US plans that the only solution was to remove Osama bin Laden by full-scale military force? Was this overreach necessary to crush a tiny non-state actor? 
By tying itself to the apron strings of the US, Britain‚Äôs reputation has been stained by America‚Äôs unilateral retreat from Afghanistan. Had Blair taken a leaf out of Harold Wilson‚Äôs book ‚Äì who famously refused Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs entreaties to join the US war in Vietnam ‚Äì the UK would not now be in such an invidious position. When will Britain learn that its national interests are not always identical to, or in symmetry with, hegemonic America? At least some brave parliamentarians now share this view.

                    <span>The Law and Justice party‚Äôs authoritarian grip on the country‚Äôs politics has been weakened
At a glance, it has been business as usual this summer for Poland‚Äôs conservative-nationalist government. There has been a fierce row over attempts to introduce a disciplinary system to keep judges in line. A controversial new bill threatens to further compromise media independence, by banning non-European ownership of broadcasting companies. Both the European Union and the United States have railed at these latest anti-democratic manoeuvres, designed to strengthen the authoritarian grip of the Law and Justice party (PiS). But, despite all the international criticism, PiS remains ahead of its rivals in the polls.
So far, so familiar. But six years after PiS won power, turning Poland into a bastion of European illiberalism alongside Hungary, the party‚Äôs polarising playbook is not working the political magic it once did. This week Warsaw backed down on the judges dispute, which was in danger of becoming a tipping point in its vexed relations with the EU. Under pressure from Brussels, it has disbanded the supreme court chamber ‚Äì packed with political appointees ‚Äì to which court verdicts would have been answerable. Having gone to the brink, Poland blinked first.

Separate surveys carried out by poverty charities indicate that between 18% and 36% of claimants did not know their income will fall by ¬£90 a week or ¬£1,050 a year after September ‚Äì the biggest cut to social security payments since the second world war.

                    <span>Mike Lucraft responds to an article about Adam Crozier, who was in charge of Royal Mail when subpostmasters were accused of theft because of a faulty IT system
So, Adam Crozier, the new chair of BT, ‚Äúspent two decades steering businesses out of corporate crisis‚Äù (Can Adam Crozier help connect BT to a bright future?, 17 August)? Really? From 2003 until 2010, when he was chief executive of Royal Mail (which then owned the Post Office), he oversaw the hounding of subpostmasters who were accused of theft and fraud because of the seriously flawed Fujitsu Horizon IT system that they were obliged to use. Under his watch, people were bankrupted and ostracised as prosecutions were pursued against them.
This scandal has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in English legal history (UK government sets aside up to ¬£233m to cover Post Office payouts, 25 July). Only in the past year or so has there been any correction of the shocking wrong done to those subpostmasters. Nobody in charge at the Post Office or Fujitsu has ever been brought to book. And as for compensation, will it be the Post Office or Fujitsu or any of those who were in charge paying? No. It will be the taxpayer. So, Adam Crozier did not steer the Post Office out of any corporate crisis. He steered it headlong into one.

Jerhonda Pace resumed her testimony in Brooklyn federal court a day after telling jurors she was a 16-year-old virgin and a member of Kelly‚Äôs fan club when he invited her to his mansion in 2009.

At 10.5 metres wide, four centuries old and twice the size of its nearest cousin, an ‚Äúexceptionally large‚Äù coral has been discovered on the Great Barrier Reef ‚Äì the widest known in the area.
The coral is 5.3 metres tall, ‚Äúhemispherical in shape‚Äù and 2.4 metres wider than the next widest specimen. It is roughly the length and height of a modern double-decker bus.

The City of London will be the target of a new round of Extinction Rebellion protests aimed at highlighting the role of high finance in the climate crisis, starting next week and carrying on for at least a fortnight.
Thousands of protesters are expected to take part in a series of actions in the City, details of which are under wraps. These will target businesses headquartered in the Square Mile financial district, and will include site occupations. There are no plans to disrupt public transport, as has occurred during some previous actions.

The average custodial sentence length for violent crimes fell by 22% to 18.5 months and the figure for sexual offences fell by 12% to 52 months, the lowest figure since 2011, according to official figures.

It is well known that sex sells, but, on reality TV, love sells even more. Nowhere is this better illustrated than on ITV2‚Äôs Love Island. Despite complaints about this season being bland, as well as concerns about the contestants‚Äô conduct (Faye Winters‚Äô tirade towards Teddy Soares broke the show‚Äôs record for Ofcom‚Äôs complaints, racking up nearly 25,000), it has attracted the biggest digital audience of any show this year.
As we prepare for its culmination next week, a slate of other dating shows are already vying for its place. For instance, Ready to Mingle, which starts on ITV2 next month. In the series, a woman searches for her perfect partner among 12 male suitors, but not all of the boys are single. I smell a smash hit.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises ministers, met on Thursday morning and some members believe that significantly more work is needed before booster jabs can be rolled out.

Sonny Chiba, the Japanese martial arts movie star who found late-career renown in Hollywood after outspoken admiration from Quentin Tarantino, has died aged 82 from a Covid-related illness. Variety reported that it had received confirmation of the news from Chiba‚Äôs agent.
With an acting career beginning in the 1960s with a string of roles in Japanese martial arts films and TV shows, Chiba became widely known in the west after being name-checked in True Romance, the 1993 thriller written by Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. By then, Chiba had become a star in Japan, appearing in titles such as the 1970s Street Fighter trilogy (and its spin-off, Sister Street Fighter), Bullet Train and Champion of Death.

The French scientist who promoted the discredited hydroxychloroquine treatment for Covid-19 backed by Donald Trump faces being pushed out of the infectious diseases institute he founded, amid concerns from key members over its role in feeding conspiracy theories and an investigation by regulators into its clinical studies.
Didier Raoult has built a worldwide following throughout the pandemic for his support of the malaria drug despite its failure in randomised control trials. Multiple studies, including by the Recovery trial and the World Health Organisation, have found hydroxychloroquine to be ineffective in treating Covid-19.

If historians of the future wish to understand the ignorance and hubris that accompanied the decline of the west‚Äôs power, this week‚Äôs emergency parliamentary debate on Afghanistan will provide an insightful case study. The delusions that have long characterised British foreign policy remained intact when Iraq was destroyed for the sake of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction; when British soldiers were forced into a humiliating retreat from Iraq‚Äôs southern city of Basra at the hands of Iranian-backed Shia militias; and when Libya was left as a failed state. It seemed unlikely that the Taliban casually waltzing into Kabul would finally break the spell.
Take the much celebrated contribution from Theresa May, who asked, ‚ÄúWhere is global Britain on the streets of Kabul?‚Äù and rued the repercussions of Britain depending ‚Äúon a unilateral decision taken by the United States‚Äù. The former prime minister is a fantasist: Britain has not had a foreign policy independent of the United States since the 1950s, and indefinite occupation of Afghanistan, which has been proposed as an alternative to withdrawal, effectively means transforming the country into a colony.

                    <span>In a message from his prison cell, the jailed Russian opposition activist calls for the west to take sanctions against oligarchs
Exactly one year ago, I did not die from poisoning by a chemical weapon, and it would seem that corruption played no small part in my survival. Having contaminated Russia‚Äôs state system, corruption has also contaminated the intelligence services. When a country‚Äôs senior management is preoccupied with protection rackets and extortion from businesses, the quality of covert operations inevitably suffers. A group of FSB agents applied the nerve agent to my underwear just as shoddily as they incompetently dogged my footsteps for three and a half years ‚Äì in violation of all instructions from above ‚Äì allowing civil investigating activists to expose them at every turn.
To be fair, a regime based on corruption can perform more elementary tasks to perfection. The judicial system ‚Äì the first thing autocrats intent on robbing their nation take control of ‚Äì functions perfectly on a quid pro quo basis. That is why, when I went back to Russia after medical treatment, I was taken straight from the plane to prison. There is not much to celebrate in that, but at least I now have time to read the memoirs of world leaders.

                    <span>Ayten Amin‚Äôs Souad is a razor-sharp portrayal of sisterhood and sexual awakening that is rarely represented on screen
When the Egyptian director Ayten Amin was 10 years old, a classmate‚Äôs sister killed herself. The news gripped the school. But, in a society where suicide is a sin, no one talked about it; instead, they mourned the girl as though she had died mysteriously, or in an accident. ‚ÄúWhen I was shooting my first film, it suddenly hit me,‚Äù Amin says over a video call from her home in Cairo. ‚ÄúHow did my classmate feel back then? How did she grow up knowing what happened, but with no one talking about it?‚Äù
In her new film, Souad, Amin explores precisely this: the hidden lives of teenage girls in Egypt. It follows the title character (played by Bassant Ahmed) and Rabab (Basmala Elghaiesh), sisters of 19 and 13 living in Zagazig, a small city 40 miles north of Cairo in the Nile delta. To her family and friends, Souad is as religious as she is studious ‚Äì but she lives a different life online. She has virtual relationships with men and becomes enthralled by the glamorous-seeming Ahmed (Hussein Ghanem), an influencer from the fashionable Mediterranean city of Alexandria. Their relationship begins to sour when Souad stands up Ahmed for a real-life date; it gets steadily worse as a cycle of sexts and arguments sets in. Then tragedy strikes.

The coroner overseeing the case of the Plymouth gunman, Jake Davison, who killed his mother and four other people, has asked a watchdog to examine whether changes to weapons licensing have been made since a man shot dead three women in the north of England almost 10 years ago.
At the opening of inquests into the deaths of Jake Davison and his five victims, it emerged that the 22-year-old apprentice crane driver shot his mother in the head and torso after an argument. He went on to kill four people he did not know, including a three-year-old girl, in nearby streets and a park. He then shot himself in the head, the court was told.

Shibe‚Äôs playing  buzzes with vitality in this revelatory new recording
You might think you know what Spanish guitar music sounds like, and you might think it an unexpectedly middle-of-the-road choice for Sean Shibe, who has always appeared more at home in programmes that set your ears slightly off-kilter: for example, juxtaposing whispering lute music with screaming electric guitar works by Julia Wolfe, as on his 2018 album softLOUD. But there‚Äôs nothing hackneyed about Camino. It‚Äôs a beautifully intimate recording, full of playing that is as far from classical-guitar cliche as a real flamenco dancer is from a postcard of a donkey in a sombrero.

Six weeks later, the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) revised their warning: international arrivals could fall by up to 80% ‚Äì equating to a billion fewer tourists and the worst crisis in the history of the industry.

Music was like a totem pole for us, growing up in Belfast in the 70s. My mother was a singer and a dancer: she had a beautiful voice, and if there was ever a chance to get on the dancefloor, she‚Äôd take it. She loved Motown, but especially Ray Charles. I still love a ballad with a driving beat. And I still love to dance. My dad didn‚Äôt dance, so my mother was always dragging me on to the dancefloor with her when Ray Charles came on. I got used, at a young age, to clearing the dancefloor with my mother; putting on a show together. That was our bond. People would stand around clapping while we danced. That was my first public performance.

In late November 2007, Carl Cox‚Äôs DJing career was over ‚Äì or so he thought. A few days earlier he had played a set at a festival in Caracas, Venezuela, as part of a tour of South America. The vibe was good and the crowd was bouncing. ‚ÄúI heard all these fireworks go: ‚ÄòBang, bang, bang.‚Äô Everyone was going: ‚ÄòWoooo! Yeeaaaah!‚Äô‚Äù Cox mimics dancing behind the decks. ‚ÄúThen there were more bangs and I thought: ‚ÄòYay, more fireworks!‚Äô But then I looked at the crowd and something was wrong. They were dispersing. I realised: ‚ÄòFuck, that‚Äôs not fireworks, that‚Äôs gunfire.‚Äô‚Äù
Two rival gang members had met on the dancefloor and begun shooting. Cox got down on the floor and crawled to a backstage locker room where he and his tour manager barricaded themselves in. After an hour, they were escorted out to a car, past scores of police vans and ambulances. Four people had died and nine were injured. ‚ÄúSeeing people shot on the dancefloor and dying in front of me, blood everywhere ‚Ä¶‚Äù Cox says, rubbing his eyes. ‚ÄúOne minute we were having the time of our lives and the next we were cowering for our lives.‚Äù

In August 2018, the then 15-year-old Greta Thunberg started spending her school days outside the Swedish parliament calling for stronger action on climate change. It might sound perverse, a teacher supporting kids taking time off school, but spreading awareness of environmental issues is something I‚Äôve always been passionate about. The challenge is finding a way to give them a meaningful climate education in the classroom.
As a middle school (aged nine to 13) science teacher, I‚Äôve seen pupils react to the climate crisis in a number of ways. I still hear ‚Äúmy dad says it‚Äôs not real‚Äù every once in a while, but mostly they are interested. Interested in how oil companies obfuscated the truth, interested in the science, and interested in what the future holds now that we‚Äôre ‚Äúrunning out of time‚Äù.

                    <span>Biden‚Äôs hasty withdrawal removed leverage in talks with Taliban, says first female vice-president of Afghan parliament Fawzia Koofi
Joe Biden delaying the exit of American forces from Afghanistan by just a month could have made a significant difference to the outcome of continuing peace talks with the Taliban leadership, according to one of the negotiators.
Fawzia Koofi, an Afghan politician and women‚Äôs rights activist, said the chaotic withdrawal undermined all leverage that the US and the Afghan government had had with the Taliban at the talks in Qatar.

                    <span>Hundreds of people on the runway, women and children screaming, and gunshots lighting up the sky: Afghan journalist Ramin Rahman spoke to the Guardian about his chaotic escape from Hamid Karzai international airport the day the Taliban took Kabul.
Rahman, 27, left Kabul fearing for his life. As &#x27;a progressive, outspoken journalist with tattoos&#x27; ‚Äì he is basically the antithesis of what the¬†Taliban¬†stand for.
He described several hours of uncertainty and panic, running with hundreds of others towards US aircraft, and the agonising wait before the plane took off from Afghanistan

His three-year renovation of the building, comprising three apartments above a skate store, included installing energy-efficient windows and insulation, plus fully electric appliances, heating and cooling systems.

Equipped with lovely melodies and a bombast-resistant sound, the New Zealander exchanges the spotlight for a sly reflection on true happiness
Plenty of mainstream pop stars have decided they no longer want to be mainstream pop stars. They‚Äôve tried everything to achieve their goal, from making deliberately unlistenable albums, to ‚Äì in the memorable case of the late Scott Walker ‚Äì locking themselves in a monastery on the Isle of Wight.
But few have attempted to bid farewell to mainstream pop stardom as prettily as Lorde does on her third album. It opens with a guitar picking a gentle, woozy-sounding figure. A flute glides beatifically by and Lorde offers a grim depiction of life as a teenager superstar ‚Äì complete with ‚Äúnightmares from the camera flash‚Äù ‚Äì before apparently saying goodbye to all that: ‚Äúalone on a windswept island‚Äù, she ‚Äúwon‚Äôt take the call if it‚Äôs the label or radio‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a saviour,‚Äù she adds, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not me‚Äù, which would sound a little self-aggrandising had the world of online fandom not become so overheated that whenever a female pop star posts anything on social media, the responses are clogged up by stans calling them ‚Äúmum‚Äù, ‚Äúqueen‚Äù and ‚Äúgoddess‚Äù.

In 2019, Wanda Jackson announced her retirement from performing. She had been on the road for 65 years, during which time she had variously been a country star, a rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll pioneer, a gospel singer and a grande dame hailed as either the Queen of Rockabilly, or its First Lady. It was a career that had taken her from touring with Elvis Presley just as his career took off to collaborating with Jack White, but she was ready to stop travelling: she had suffered a stroke, ‚Äúproblems with my knees and such‚Äù, and Wendell Goodman, her husband and manager of 55 years, had died in 2017. She was, she says, ‚Äúglad of the rest‚Äù.
And yet, here we are, two and a half years on. Jackson is peering out of my laptop screen from her home in Oklahoma: 83, sharp as a tack, fully madeup, elaborately coiffured and brushing aside queries about what happened to her retirement with a chuckle of ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to get a good girl down‚Äù.

                    <span>Establishing humanitarian corridors and monitoring human rights is crucial ‚Äì and achievable ‚Äì as the Taliban take control

Mark Malloch-Brown is a former UN deputy secretary general

I have seen this tragedy before. As a young UN planner in the late 1980s, I helped design the relief operation after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. More than a decade later, as head of the UN Development Programme, I led early relief and reconstruction efforts after the fall of the Taliban. In both cases, the fragile peace that followed conflicts was undermined by key actors in the international community, who stood back or actively opposed when their assistance was needed. The US armed the opposition to the government the Soviets left behind; and when a US-backed government then took power after 9/11, it faced opposition from America‚Äôs Asian rivals.

                    <span>If I exert control during sex, I don‚Äôt enjoy it. I prefer to lie back ‚Äì but how do I square this with my beliefs?
I have been with my partner for almost six years and, for the most part, have enjoyed our sex. I prefer to ‚Äòsit back and relax‚Äô and my partner is OK with that. If I get on top or have too much control, I am unable to get out of my head and I feel stressed. However, my personality and moral side finds this conflicting, as outside the bedroom I am a feminist and agree that women have for too long been taught to submit to their man and forget their own needs. This has caused confusion in my understanding of the way I enjoy sex. How can I feel as if I am in control without being dominant in the bedroom? Can I be a feminist while being submissive during sex?
Consensual sex requires that both partners give permission for what occurs, whether they take on a more passive or a dominant role at any given moment. If someone chooses to assume a submissive erotic position, that is an agreement that he or she could withdraw at any time. So, in fact, the submissive partner is actually the moral controller; if that person wishes to gain physical dominance, he or she must first be sure that permission for that is fully granted by the partner. But while these facts may help you to consider physical submission more ethically palatable, in general, erotic connections are heightened when taboos are broken ‚Ä¶ including what might be considered a feminist no-no.

My youngest son is almost four, so the sleep-deprived agony of newborn parenting has fully receded. My sleep is no longer jittery and surface-level, primed to be wrecked by the tiniest disturbance. When I sleep now, I expect to sleep.
Then last month, like a dummy, I took my kids camping. True, I did everything to maximise the amount of sleep I‚Äôd get. I booked a slightly upmarket campsite, complete with actual beds, and did some sums. The sun went down late and came up early, so my sons would wake up at the crack of dawn. But if I drifted off when they did, and everything worked out perfectly, I could just about cram in six hours.

                    <span>Humiliated by his party over Afghanistan, the prime minister‚Äôs lack of foreign policy strategy is becoming a political problem
When the government first drew up plans to axe the virtual parliament and bring MPs back to the Commons chamber, ministers argued that it would boost support for the prime minister. Boris Johnson tends to work best with a crowd, so events such as prime minister‚Äôs questions were trickier when only a handful of Tory MPs were allowed in the chamber.
But when Conservative politicians turned up en masse to the Commons on Wednesday to debate the situation in Afghanistan, the opposite proved true. Rather than provide supportive interventions, Johnson soon discovered his biggest critics were sitting right behind him.

                    <span>Australian psychologist Steven Taylor published what would turn out to be a prophetic book, and it has become like a Lonely Planet guide to the pandemic
In October 2019, a month or so before Covid-19 began to spread from the industrial Chinese city of Wuhan, Steven Taylor, an Australian psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, published what would turn out to be a remarkably prophetic book, The Psychology of Pandemics.
Even his publishers had doubts about its relevance and market potential. But in the 22 months since, the book has become like a Lonely Planet guide to the pandemic, passed around and marked up like waypoints along a new and dreadful global health journey.

                    <span>Mountains offer great landscapes, hiking and places to stay, as these ideas from a new Wild Guide to the French Alps show
While the pristine turquoise waters of Lac d‚ÄôAnnecy are renowned, the remote massif of Les Bauges, which rises to its west and south, is one of the least-visited areas of the French Alps. Fringed on almost all sides by great forested limestone ridges and escarpments, the interior of the Bauges feels a place apart in time as well as in geography. As it‚Äôs a protected parc naturel regional, ski development here is limited mostly to the cross-country variety. In summer this verdant oasis of green, cut by deep gorges and ravines, is a nature lover‚Äôs dream.

                    <span>Mohammed El Halabi is accused of stealing relief money and giving it to Hamas for their war effort against Israel. But five years on, the evidence against him looks seriously flawed
At about 9am on 12 July 2016, dozens of Israeli security officers stormed through the gates of the Augusta Victoria hospital complex in East Jerusalem. They surged past the hospital, which mostly serves the local Palestinian population, and through the main car park to a three-storey building where the offices of the international charity World Vision were located.
The officers, some armed with rifles, ordered the charity‚Äôs few dozen staff into a meeting room and seized their phones to prevent them contacting the outside world. According to witnesses, they were kept there for the next four hours. Occasionally, Israeli police and intelligence agents called an employee out of the room for questioning, while others roamed the offices, searching through files.

The ozone-wrecking chemicals once commonly used in refrigerators would have driven 2.5C of extra global heating by the end of the century if they had not been banned, research has found.
Modelling by climate scientists found that the 1987 Montreal protocol curbing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gave humans a fighting chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out by the Paris agreement.

Did that contribute to his violence ‚Äì and does the incel movement radicalise some of the young men who are part of it?
Last Thursday night, a 22-year-old man killed five people, including his mother and a three-year-old girl, in Plymouth. It was the worst mass shooting in Britain in more than a decade.

Police initially described the murders as a ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù incident. But as more evidence emerged about the killer, who also took his own life, we learned that he had been immersed in a misogynist online world known as the ‚Äúincel‚Äù movement ‚Äì and now police are seriously considering the possibility that his actions were motivated by a hatred of women.

A record number of children and young people with a potentially life-threatening eating disorder are waiting for treatment in England, as psychiatrists warn soaring demand is overwhelming services.
NHS data analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists shows that while the number of those waiting for urgent and routine treatment has reached record levels during the pandemic, more children and young people are being treated than ever before.

The country has been in turmoil since 1 February, when the armed forces seized power in a lightning coup, triggering dissent as protesters demanded a return to democracy.

People with mentally stimulating jobs have a lower risk of dementia in later years than those who have non-stimulating work, research has suggested.
Scientists looked at more than 100,000 participants across studies from the UK, Europe and the US focused on links between work-related factors and chronic disease, disability and mortality.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Fully vaccinated adults can harbour virus levels as high as unvaccinated people if infected with the Delta variant, according to a sweeping analysis of UK data, which supports the idea that hitting the threshold for herd immunity is unlikely.
There is abundant evidence that Covid vaccines in the UK continue to offer significant protection against hospitalisations and death. But this new analysis shows that although being fully vaccinated means the risk of getting infected is lower, once infected by Delta a person can carry similar virus levels as unvaccinated people.

It may have seemed a good day for medieval monks when a papal decree allowed them to start eating meat including mutton, beef, pork and venison. It was not so good for their bowels.
Research by English Heritage sheds light on the day-to-day lives and digestive troubles of monks at Muchelney Abbey in Somerset ‚Äì in particular the consequence of a change in papal law, in 1336, which permitted the twice-weekly consumption of meat from four-legged animals.

Bewitching melodies abound as Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs terrifically OTT but warm and inclusive musical finally arrives
Delayed by a year because of the pandemic, and with last month‚Äôs opening night postponed at the 11th hour, Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs new musical is finally up and running. It arrives late but in high fashion with outre gowns, bare-chested swordplay, brutal high heels and whip-smart humour. It‚Äôs worth the wait.
The original story and book by Emerald Fennell have heart and a torrent of barbed wit, exposing the faulty morals in traditional fairytales without scrimping on glittering trimmings. David Zippel‚Äôs crystalline lyrics are attuned to Fennell‚Äôs dialogue, cheekily satirical yet wistful and uplifting too. Lord Lloyd-Webber‚Äôs richly enjoyable orchestrations range from grand waltzes, courtly processionals and marches to deftly pastiched and deeply felt romanticism, power-balladry, a splash of chanson and rollicking guitar riffs. Bewitching melodies abound: some refrains are practically iridescent, revealing new tones from scene to scene.

Arsenal are closing on a ¬£30m deal to sign the Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The 23-year-old, who was part of Gareth Southgate‚Äôs England squad at Euro 2020, is expected to provide competition for Bernd Leno and was Mikel Arteta‚Äôs first-choice goalkeeping target this summer.
The proposed deal is for Ramsdale worth an initial ¬£24m, plus ¬£6m in performance-related add-ons. Arteta is understood to be keen on adding a contingent of young players with personality to develop on his watch. Arsenal have already signed the defender Ben White for ¬£50m from Brighton, while a move for the Norway midfielder Martin √òdegaard is also thought to be progressing.

Naomi Osaka admitted that at times over the last year she felt ungrateful about her view that playing tennis on the world stage was not enough of an accomplishment in itself.

In the past year, Osaka has pulled out of the French Open and Wimbledon before she returned to her native Japan to light the flame at the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony, then lost in the third round of the women‚Äôs singles competition.

However. Those few minutes represent the full yield of genuine entertainment provided by 17 series of the makeover show Changing Rooms, which dominated the airwaves (a concept I‚Äôll have to explain later, O infant roamers of the fragmented contemporary TV landscape) from 1996 to 2004.

Whitehall and security sources said they could not guarantee how long the US would keep its contingent of 6,000 troops on the ground and cautioned that the UK could not continue the rescue without their presence. They also indicated Britain was not engaging with the Taliban directly over security or other issues after the militant group seized the Afghan capital.

                    <span>Competition regulator to look at whether merger with US private equity-owned Cobham is national security risk
The takeover of the British defence firm Ultra Electronics by a US private equity company will be investigated on national security grounds, after the business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, told the competition regulator to examine the deal.
Warning that foreign investment ‚Äúmust not threaten national security‚Äù, Kwarteng tabled an order in parliament preventing Ultra from disclosing ‚Äúsensitive information‚Äù to Cobham, the defence firm behind the ¬£2.6bn takeover bid. He said Ultra would be prevented from passing on details of the ‚Äúgoods or services it provides to HM Government or HM Armed Forces‚Äù, while the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) examined the deal.

Downing Street has given its strongest signal yet that the pensions triple lock will be watered down because of the recent surge in average earnings, which under current rules would deliver a rise of more than 8% for pensioners next year.
Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesperson said on Wednesday there were concerns about linking the rise in state pensions to earnings.

Few homes were left standing in Grizzly Flats, California, the small northern California forest town leveled by the Caldor fire on Tuesday.
Streets in the town of about 1,200 people were littered with downed power lines and poles. Houses were reduced to smoldering ash and twisted metal with only chimneys rising above the ruins. A post office and elementary school were also destroyed. Two people were in the hospital with serious injuries.

The World Health Organization has condemned the rush by wealthy countries to provide Covid-19 vaccine booster shots while millions of people around the world have yet to receive a single dose.
Speaking before US authorities announced all vaccinated Americans would soon be eligible to receive booster doses, WHO experts insisted there was not enough scientific evidence to support the additional shot.

The prime minister told parliament on Wednesday that Britain was prepared for the fall of Kabul and also that it could not have been foreseen. Those two things cannot be true simultaneously. Both were false. The pace of events after US forces were withdrawn might have caught western governments by surprise, but the withdrawal itself has been on the international timetable since February 2020.
That it was agreed by Donald Trump is not an excuse for his successor‚Äôs misjudgements. But nor are Joe Biden‚Äôs actions a justification for Boris Johnson‚Äôs complacency in failing to plan a response. As recently as July, the prime minister asserted that the Taliban had no military route to victory.

                    <span>Tearing down old structures and throwing up new ones is how we usually make our streetscapes. It‚Äôs also ruinous for the climate
A new and highly swanky hotel lands in Edinburgh, a mass of shimmering bronze-coloured coils, and all anyone can think to say is: doesn‚Äôt that look like a giant poo emoji? Londoners are confronted with plans for a giant burning-red orb, which will supposedly serve as a concert venue, and it brings on the shudders.
New buildings can amuse or repulse us, induce awe or yawns, but there is a case for thinking of them less as objects to walk around and more as processes to worry about ‚Äì because the process of building is one of the most wasteful and carbon-hungry engaged in by humanity. We tear down old houses or shops, and to create new ones, we cover the Earth with materials that have gobbled up fossil fuels: Concrete, of which the world pours enough each year to patio over every park and mountain and back garden, every square inch, in England; steel, of which every tonne produced emits nearly two tonnes of carbon dioxide; plastics. While Conservative MPs argue over who is going to foot the bill for green energy for our homes, hardly anyone in Westminster discusses the upfront carbon costs of building houses and office blocks and shopping malls. Yet construction directly accounts for about 10% of our carbon emissions. Turning approximately 50,000 buildings to rubble every year creates two-thirds of all the waste produced in this country. If the UK is ever to translate its net zero ambitions into reality it will need to change the entire building industry.

R&amp;A‚Äôs Slumbers says announcement ‚Äòsends a strong signal‚Äô

The Women‚Äôs Open has been handed a status and financial boost ahead of tee-off at Carnoustie with a $1.3m prize fund increase to $5.8m, making the tournament the most lucrative in female golf. On Sunday the champion on Scotland‚Äôs east coast will collect a cheque for $870,000 (¬£632,000).
Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A‚Äôs chief executive, announced the fillip for this major championship with considerable glee on Wednesday. And no wonder: Slumbers promised the pot at Muirfield in 2022 will be at least $6.8m. Between 2014 and 2016, the purse had been fixed at $3m, with the winner‚Äôs share always less than $500,000. Slumbers has credited AIG, the event‚Äôs main sponsor since 2019, with helping to elevate its status.

One of Papua New Guinea‚Äôs chief health officers has warned the country‚Äôs low testing rates, high percentage of positive tests and low vaccination rates provide a ‚Äúrecipe for major spread of the Delta variant‚Äù after the country recorded its 12th case of the deadly strain.
Dr Daoni Esorom, the deputy controller of PNG‚Äôs national pandemic response, said officials were so concerned that low testing rates were masking a serious outbreak that they had ordered doctors at the country‚Äôs biggest hospital to swab all corpses of people who had died from unknown causes or who had respiratory illnesses, to see if they had Covid-19.

The Society of Editors said it would now work to improve diversity in the industry and would no longer stand by statements made in March by its former director Ian Murray. He had strongly disputed claims by the Duchess of Sussex that negative coverage of her relationship with her husband, Prince Harry, was motivated by her skin colour.

                    <span>Readers respond to Kojo Koram‚Äôs article about the Tory preoccupation with dictating our national story
Kojo Koram provides a useful corrective to the common, narrow perception of culture he describes (Here‚Äôs what the right gets wrong about culture: it‚Äôs not a monument, but a living thing, 16 August), but the ‚Äúfossilised version of British culture‚Äù he identifies is not easily separated from the equally prevalent narrow, prescriptive notions about history that underpin it.
Too many people (and ‚Äúculture war‚Äù fantasists in particular) approach history as an indisputable account of the past, when in fact historical understanding is a continual work in progress. This misunderstanding of history, both as a discipline and as an account, helps to entrench the view that culture is something fixed and unchanging and just as frequently invokes the equally problematic notion of ‚Äútradition‚Äù as a supposed trump card in arguments about both culture and history.

According to reports in state media, Xi Jinping told officials at a meeting of the Chinese Communist party‚Äôs central financial and economic affairs commission on Tuesday, that the government should ‚Äúregulate excessively high incomes and encourage high-income groups and enterprises to return more to society‚Äù.

When rising British casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq started to raise public doubts 15 years ago, a new mantra began to be heard: Iraq was a war of choice, Afghanistan a war of necessity. The argument was that the US and its faithful ally, Britain, had launched an invasion in Iraq that was unjustified as it was based on a false premise: the hollow claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Sean Lock, who has died of cancer aged 58, was a bespectacled, besuited and well-groomed standup comedian who projected a constant air of puzzlement as he imparted his deadpan observational humour. His style was best summed up by his own assessment: ‚ÄúWhen it comes down to it, comedy is rehearsed moaning.‚Äù
He was adept at blending wordplay with slapstick and the occasional touch of the absurd, covering subjects from salad cream, 1970s furniture and messy family cars to the origins of cake decoration, golf on the radio and forgetting to take a ‚Äúbag for life‚Äù to do the supermarket shop.

‚Ä¢ UK media repeat call for evacuation of Afghan colleagues
Dear prime minister and foreign secretary,
When British media organisations wrote to you earlier this month about the grave Taliban threat to Afghan journalists and translators who had worked with us, you responded almost immediately. You recognised their vital contribution to a free press by reporting on the British mission in Afghanistan and promised colleagues at risk a path to safety. President Biden did the same in the United States.

The initial shock of a packed House of Commons, recalled in recess for an emergency debate on Afghanistan, was how unfamiliar the packed green benches now look. Even before the pandemic, arguably since the prorogation of parliament, there‚Äôs been a question mark over the point of it all; does a debate have to end in a vote, in order to have meaning? Is it otherwise just theatre, and if so, what democratic purpose does it serve?
The answer used to be very simple: it was to test and challenge the policy of the executive. It may have been ritualistic, but the ritual was dense with significance, indicating that no prime minister had the power simply to announce, every one must persuade.

The signs are promising so far for this year‚Äôs harvest ‚Äì known in the trade as a campaign ‚Äì which takes place later than for other crops, during the autumn and winter.

Open letter urges Boris Johnson to make good on promise

British media organisations have again urged the government to evacuate Afghan journalists and translators who worked with UK media outlets, with many local staff fearing Taliban reprisals.
Dozens of local reporters and producers associated with British organisations remain in Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul on Sunday. This month the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, promised to consider relocating local journalists to the UK on an ‚Äúexceptional basis‚Äù if there was evidence they were under imminent threat because of their involvement with Britain.

Rail fares in England and Wales are on track to rise at their fastest rate in a decade unless ministers decide to prevent steep price increases to encourage commuters back on to trains.
Annual increases in rail fares are usually governed by the July retail prices index (RPI), plus another 1%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday that RPI for July was 3.8%, meaning prices could rise by 4.8% in January. That would be the steepest increase since 2012.

The Labour politician Austin Mitchell got his timing wrong. Had he entered the Commons 10 years before he did, he might have knuckled down and become a minister. As it was, he spent most of his first 20 years in parliament sitting in opposition, by which time his chance had probably passed, and the remaining 18 years, it sometimes seemed, commenting adversely and often publicly about the party and its leadership.
His sense of humour, which he thought of as bluff and bracing, often seemed to be somewhat awry, too. When he scoffed in 2014 that his constituency, Great Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, was so solidly Labour that ‚Äúa raving, alcoholic sex paedophile‚Äù could get elected as the party‚Äôs candidate, he seemed surprised that anyone might take offence. But it was in truth only the latest in a trail of slightly off-pitch jokes made by a clever man and a frustrated politician.

Many artists at the time, including Derek Jarman and Andrew Logan, squatted in warehouses there, and in her time Bean has worked with everyone from slapstick clowns the Kipper Kids to artists such as Paul McCarthy and Rose English, as well as sharing bills with Psychic TV, Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. She even opened for Roxy Music as part of the pseudo-pop band Moody and the Menstruators, an avant garde performance covers group she founded in 1971. Bean has often used sound in her work and loves music ‚Äì her father was a classical and jazz musician ‚Äì but Moody was never supposed to be a real band, more ‚Äúa subversive exploration of the boundaries between art and music‚Äù.

Afghanistan latest updates ‚Äì live

Other leaders have had the luxury of being able to deliver an uninterrupted televised address. But Boris Johnson had to justify the ignominious retreat from Afghanistan in front of a testy, and at times hostile, House of Commons ‚Äì dominated by critics from his own side asking if Britain could have been better prepared and if the collapse of the Kabul government could have been averted.
It was an occasion the UK prime minister struggled to rise to, not helped by the format that Downing Street had opted for: a general debate, which meant MPs were allowed to rise and seek to intervene as Johnson spoke, generating a crescendo of background noise after he had completed a line or two.

Scream queen Barbara Crampton, the always-welcome star of many a smart if schlocky horror movie (see Chopping Mall, You‚Äôre Next, assorted Puppet Master flicks) is in her element here playing Anne, the mostly neglected and ignored spouse of suburban minister Jakob (Larry Fessenden). Years back, Anne had ambitions to travel and find adventure, but instead of marrying handsome classmate Tom (Robert Rusler), she settled for kindly if ditchwater-dull Jakob, and a lifetime of sitting in pews listening to his dreary sermons and talking to parishioners.
An assignation with old flame Tom, in town to buy a disused mill, and a stolen kiss seem like the prelude to a Mills &amp; Boon-style tale of middle-age adultery and lust. Thankfully we‚Äôre not going in that direction; instead, this turns into a blood-splattered vampire movie when Anne is bitten but not killed by a mysterious bloodsucker known as the Master (Bonnie Aarons from The Conjuring/The Nun franchise). Soon she‚Äôs wearing clever little chokers to hid her puncture marks, lipstick the colour of haemoglobin, and insisting Jakob take her out to dinner, service her reawakened libido, and generally treat her with more respect.

Dom Sibley has been dropped from the England squad for the third Test against India at Headingley next week, with the team‚Äôs head coach, Chris Silverwood, admitting the batsman ‚Äúneeds some time away to regain his confidence‚Äù.
Sibley has finally paid the price for a prolonged spell of poor form with the bat ‚Äì since he scored 120 against West Indies at Old Trafford last summer his average, which in eight matches up to that point had stood at 44.33, has fallen to 28.94. International opponents have repeatedly exploited technical failings ‚Äì his past 15 Test innings include three ducks, five single-figure scores and a single half-century ‚Äì while the pace at which he scores his runs has also been criticised.

For centuries, pilgrims have walked in the footsteps of monks who once inhabited Lindisfarne, connected by a tidal causeway to the ancient kingdom of Northumbria.
They have marvelled at the birthplace of the Lindisfarne gospels, one of the most celebrated illuminated manuscripts in the world, admired the castle that towers over crashing waves and the ruins of the ancient priory, and watched thousands of grey seals basking on the sand banks.

                    <span>Heartbroken, sunburned and without my makeup, I felt totally lost. Perhaps the handsome stranger at my table could offer some excitement?
It was high summer on the Italian island of Procida, too hot but somehow still green, and I was eating dinner at a beachside cafe that spilled on to the black sand of the west-facing Spiaggia di Ciraccio.
I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. Ten days earlier, a long-building romance with a screenwriter from Milan had ended abruptly. It had begun when our knees touched in his car. Long emails full of agony and promise followed, made all the less real for jumping between English and Italian, but then stopped. A short trip to Naples to try things in a new context was cancelled. I was desperately sad, but had already booked my flight to Italy and, as it happened, a friend was staying on the island nearby. So, I tagged along.

Afghanistan live news: latest updates

Boris Johnson faced a wall of fury from all wings of the Conservative party over the UK‚Äôs conduct in Afghanistan, with 11 former cabinet ministers among the dozens of MPs and peers expressing their anger and frustration at Britain‚Äôs failures in intelligence and preparation.
During a torrid session in the House of Commons, the overwhelming majority of Tories who spoke condemned Britain‚Äôs failure to anticipate the Taliban takeover of Kabul and its perceived humiliation on the world stage. More than 30 Tory MPs spoke against the government, while only a handful voiced support for its actions.

                    <span>Assigning someone the legal power to make decisions for a vulnerable adult should always be a last resort
Around the world, fans of pop star Britney Spears celebrated her father‚Äôs announcement last week that he would resign as her conservator. This development is welcome news for Spears and her supporters, dubbed the #FreeBritney movement. But it will not end Spears‚Äô conservatorship, which has prevented her from making decisions about her own life since it was established shortly after she had a mental breakdown in 2008. Nor will it prevent others from finding themselves in similar situations. That will require changing the underlying legal systems that created Spears‚Äô predicament.
While many have only recently learned of conservatorship thanks to the #FreeBritney movement, this legal process is neither new nor unique to the US. It is a common court proceeding in which the court appoints someone to make decisions for individuals the court has found cannot make decisions for themselves. California ‚Äì where Spears lives ‚Äì calls this proceeding conservatorship and calls the appointee a conservator. More commonly, it is called guardianship and the appointee is called a guardian. While Spears has drawn attention to guardianship, the process typically entangles those far less privileged. Changes in the pop star‚Äôs situation , as welcome as they may be, won‚Äôt themselves trigger the reform of a legal mechanism mainly experienced by people society has historically treated as expendable.

                    <span>Although teams can often defy financial logic for a time, to move up a tier is incredibly difficult
The easy thing is to blame the manager. It has become football‚Äôs default response to any crisis. A team hits a poor run or loses a big game: get rid of the manager. As Alex Ferguson said as many as 14 years ago, we live in ‚Äúa mocking culture‚Äù and reality television has fostered the idea people should be voted off with great regularity (that he was trying to defend Steve McClaren‚Äôs reign as England manager should not undermine the wider point).
Managers are expendable. Rejigging squads takes time and money and huge amounts of effort in terms of research and recruitment, whereas anybody can look at who is doing well in Portugal or Greece or the Championship and spy a potential messiah. Then there are the structural factors, the underlying economic issues it is often preferable to ignore because to acknowledge them is to accept how little agency the people we shout about every week really have in football.

The attorney general, Victoria Buttigieg, laid formal charges against Fenech, who was arrested in November 2019 trying to leave Malta on his yacht, accused of complicity in the murder and criminal conspiracy. He has since been undergoing a pre-trial compilation of evidence where he pleaded not guilty.

It was one of the worst phone calls I‚Äôve ever received: a friend in Kabul calling on Sunday afternoon to say that armed men had just visited her house. Her voice was shaking to the extent that she sounded as if she was gasping for air. The men had intimidated her and left, and she had fled to a friend‚Äôs house to hide with her children. She didn‚Äôt know when they‚Äôd return, if they would find her, or when it would be possible to relocate again to somewhere farther away. I have never heard someone sound so scared.
She begged for help to escape the country; I promised I would keep trying. But options were closing all the time. Earlier that day, through a small charity, I‚Äôd managed to get my friend and her children booked on to a flight to a third country. The plan was that they‚Äôd get to safety and continue to look for a more permanent relocation. It was a brief ray of hope during a dark few days. But within hours of the booking, all commercial flights out of Kabul were cancelled.

                    <span>The UK‚Äôs gun laws are strong, but loopholes exist. The police need the resources to conduct proper, effective checks
As a young police constable, I had to face an armed suspect in a cafe. Equipped only with a truncheon, I stared at the gunman as he aimed his weapon at me and pulled the trigger point-blank at my head. The gun jammed; I was saved from death, but not from recurrent nightmares. Whether because of this experience or in spite of it, I became, during my 30-year police career, a gold firearms commander and oversaw more than 200 operations, which included officers being shot, hostage situations and high-speed firearms chases. I came to respect the power of firearms, but to firmly believe that this is a power that needs to be reserved for the right hands with stringent checks and balances.
How Jake Davison, the 22-year-old man who shot dead five people in Plymouth, came to have a firearms certificate, and how that certificate was reinstated after it had been suspended after allegations of assault, will be the subject of detailed investigations. But a much more wide-ranging debate is needed about how guns should be regulated, how we enforce regulations and whether the postcode lottery of the present system is fit for purpose.

                    <span>Swinging London‚Äôs cultural melting pot was channelled into vibrant jazz by John Surman, Alan Skidmore and others ‚Äì and it has inspired the resurgent scene of today
It was in the dusty depths of Birmingham record library in 2000 that Shabaka Hutchings first discovered the wonders of 70s British jazz. ‚ÄúI was 16 and I‚Äôd just moved back to England from Barbados,‚Äù explains the Sons of Kemet saxophonist. ‚ÄúThe first record I played was John Surman and Stu Martin Live at Woodstock Town Hall, which starts off with this really gnarly synthesiser and sax. I remember thinking: this is pretty crazy. I know this sounds like a cliche but without it being punk music they were playing with this almost punk attitude.‚Äù
The scene Hutchings is talking about was a brief golden window, from 1965 to 1975, when London record labels and recording studios opened their doors to British jazz stars creating a unique sound that combined the US influences of Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Gil Evans with the London blues, folk and rock scenes plus West Indian and African rhythms. It‚Äôs a progressive and thrilling sound ‚Äì ‚Äúrawness, freedom, experimentation,‚Äù Hutchings says ‚Äì that is now being documented in depth under the umbrella title British Jazz Explosion, with a scene-spanning compilation alongside a series of remastered original LPs.

‚Ä¢ Comedian Sean Lock dies aged 58
Sean was maybe a year ahead of me on the London comedy club scene and already had a reputation among comics as one to watch. He was really original and exciting and I wanted to be his friend. Physically tough, comfortable in himself and cool like Steve McQueen was cool, he was great company ‚Äì very bright and naturally witty. He didn‚Äôt have to try too hard; he wasn‚Äôt one of those comics who was full of nervous energy and felt the need to be permanently ‚Äúon‚Äù. We ended up sharing a flat together in Edinburgh for the festival. On his poster that year he billed himself as ‚ÄúThe Natty Rebel Returns‚Äù. I liked that: ‚ÄúThe Natty Rebel.‚Äù
I had an old 70s suit that I‚Äôd picked up in a charity shop ‚Äì navy blue, pin striped, massive lapels and flared trousers but it fitted me like the loose cover on a secondhand sofa. Sean saw it and tried it on and it looked like I‚Äôd hoped it would look on me: dead smart but also just kind of odd, like he‚Äôd just got out of prison having been banged up in 1974. Although it broke my heart, I gave it to him to wear on stage and it became his look for a while.

The radio is tuned to Magic, playing Fat Larry‚Äôs Band‚Äôs Zoom, and I mumble ‚Äúyep, sure‚Äù, not listening at first.
I had been to Ibiza three years before, on a 72-hour school leavers‚Äô bender ‚Äì a series of ‚Äúhot summer nights‚Äù of their own ‚Äì and was awed by the tiny island‚Äôs cavernous clubs and the fact that they could charge ‚Ç¨8 for a pocket-sized bottle of water. It was the trip that cemented my love for the dancefloor. In those warehouse spaces I realised that there is something deeply soulful about being surrounded by bodies locked into the communal groove, each of us moving to our own personal rhythms, unencumbered by the day‚Äôs worries and instead ‚Äì hopefully ‚Äì free to be how we want to be in this darkened space.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

Cabinet ministers have been accused of undermining Covid advice and putting MPs‚Äô and parliamentary staff‚Äôs safety at risk by declining to wear masks, as they packed the Commons chamber full to debate Afghanistan‚Äôs takeover by the Taliban.
Just two government frontbenchers chose to wear a face covering when parliament was recalled on Wednesday ‚Äì the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and the new security minister, Damian Hinds ‚Äì despite official guidance recommending they are worn in ‚Äúcrowded and enclosed spaces‚Äù.

‚ÄòWith the year we‚Äôve had, we just needed people to have insanely, intensely engrossing, almost relentless fun,‚Äù says choreographer Jade Hackett of the weekender she has curated for the Southbank Centre‚Äôs Summer Reunion series. Working with music producer DJ Walde under the umbrella of ZooNation dance company, Hackett is taking over the Thames riverside terrace for a free mini festival, three days celebrating UK hip-hop culture, and just celebrating full stop, having been starved of live shows and social occasions during the pandemic.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first stepping stone to reintegration, bringing people together in a really safe way,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll kick it off with music by Afrika Bambaataa, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, that‚Äôs the vibe; awesome social dances, the electric slide, Soul Train lines, it‚Äôll be super fun.‚Äù Audiences can watch dance battles and performances from the likes of female popping collective AIM and Afrobeats dancers HomeBros, but there‚Äôs an emphasis on participation, with a series of workshops covering dance from the 70s, 80s and 90s as well as newer styles such as Litefeet. There are daytime family activities and evenings dancing to DJ collective The Midnight Train playing garage, grime, house, R&amp;B, hip-hop and soca ‚Äì a little carnival fix for those feeling the gap left by the cancellation of Notting Hill carnival for the second consecutive year.

                    <span>New book details the enduring partnership of the former Leeds Rhino and his wife, Lindsey, and their refusal to give up living life to the full despite his MND
It‚Äôs quiet and peaceful in the summerhouse where Rob and Lindsey Burrow sit together. Pale Yorkshire sunshine streams in through the windows. We‚Äôre out in the garden in Castleford, at the home of Rob‚Äôs parents, and there are times when it‚Äôs possible to almost forget the deadly impact of motor neurone disease. Rob won eight Grand Finals with Leeds Rhinos as they dominated rugby league from 2004 to 2017 and he played 20 times for Great Britain and England in a celebrated career. But this once cheerfully garrulous man is now a silent prisoner in his body as MND paralyses him and prevents him from talking.
Rob still smiles easily and breaks his silence when he laughs. His vocal cords are in the grip of MND so it is no ordinary laugh. Sometimes, his short bark of mirth makes it sound like he is crying or struggling for breath. But his eyes confirm he is laughing. The pain and the sorrow are hidden then in the shadows beyond the summerhouse.

When Boris Afinogenov moved to Liverpool from Lithuania in 2011, he knew that most Britons preferred to live in houses rather than the Soviet-era tower block he had left behind. But in a rambling Georgian property, he quickly found himself missing his cosy old flat.
The idea of every home having its own boiler was also alien to him: in his town there were two municipal boilers for the entire population.

Uncomplicated, happy families are not to be found in most books ‚Äì no more than in most homes. Family life is messy. Try getting several people into a car, or through an airport, and you‚Äôll know how quickly family drama can escalate. And these are supposedly the easy bits. What about when there‚Äôs real trouble?
I‚Äôm drawn to stories of families under pressure, from without and within. In my story collection Shine/Variance, there‚Äôs a father smiling his way through a crisis while Christmas tree shopping with his son, a daughter pretending there‚Äôs nothing wrong with her mother, brothers and sisters realising who their parents really are. In my stories and this selection of books, we find families pretending everything is under control, when the reality is nobody knows what they are doing. All families make it up as they go along, in the hope that they‚Äôll hold it together.

                    <span>Much has been squandered since 1991, but the biggest threat to democracy today is the global contagion of cynicism
On 19 August 1991, citizens of the Soviet Union woke up to the news that Mikhail Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist party, was standing down due to ill health. That news was a lie, as many of those citizens had come to expect from their media. Tanks rolling through Moscow told the true story: a coup by politburo hardliners, determined to abort Gorbachev‚Äôs experiments in democratisation. They failed. The coup unravelled within two days. Five months later the USSR had ceased to exist.
No one in the west saw it coming, but shock at the unpredicted event yielded to conviction that it had been inevitable. The implosion of a superpower built to fulfil Marxist prophecy should have served as a warning against all claims to know the rules of history and chart its destination. But no. The fashionable idea took hold in western policy that liberal democracy was the ideological terminus.

                    <span>Lewis Hamilton posted a picture of his dog, Roscoe enjoying a plate of fruit, while apparently travelling by private jet. But he is not the only star feeding their pup a plant-based diet
The first rule of flight club is you don‚Äôt talk about flight club. While a private jet might once have been the ultimate status symbol, travelling lavishly has turned into a liability for celebrities who want to be taken seriously. ‚ÄúWhat about yer private jet, then?‚Äù has, understandably, become the knee-jerk response whenever the privileged pipe up about the climate crisis. If you‚Äôre going to lecture the hoi polloi on how we need to make sacrifices to save the world, it‚Äôs a good idea not to flaunt your own excesses.
Alas, it seems Lewis Hamilton didn‚Äôt get the memo. The racing driver is a vocal vegan who has urged his fans to avoid meat for environmental reasons. Hamilton announced last year that his dog, Roscoe, is also following a vegan diet. While Hamilton got a bit of stick for his dog‚Äôs dinners at the time, a recent Instagram post featuring Roscoe posing by a fruit platter on what looks suspiciously like a private jet has sparked a fresh round of criticism. ‚ÄúI loves beings a vegans,‚Äù the photo‚Äôs caption (written in Doglish) reads. A section of the internet immediately decided that boasting about your dog‚Äôs veganism while on a private jet was the height of hypocrisy

                    <span>Bored working in a law firm in Brussels, I filled my time writing anonymously online about love, life ‚Äì and how dull my job was. Then my colleagues found my posts ...
I wouldn‚Äôt say I was a model employee in the law firm where I worked for nearly 10 years, but I was quietly reliable and kept out of trouble. That all changed when I was summoned to the office of the senior partner ‚Äì a man I had never met ‚Äì to face him, my distinctly sombre-looking boss, and a stony-faced HR rep. I was definitely in trouble: my employers knew about my anonymous blog.
The blog and work had been connected from the start. Trying to reconcile parenting two tiny children, intense hours and the demands of our terrifying clients as a solicitor in the City had proved impossible, so I had taken a backseat role in Brussels instead. It was not a job I particularly enjoyed, but it was easy and I never had to speak to bankers. The work was low-stress, but boring; inevitably, I spent those bored hours on the internet.

To overseas eyes, going into national lockdown over a single case should have been a hard sell, even for an extraordinarily popular prime minister such as Jacinda Ardern.
But a disastrous outbreak of the Delta variant in Sydney has helped galvanise New Zealand‚Äôs ‚Äúteam of 5 million‚Äù ‚Äì and across the country, the government‚Äôs tough strategy on Covid-19 has enjoyed widespread popular support.

Pencils scratch as students in year eight feverishly work through an exam paper. At the back of the classroom, Clara Edna Chevambo, 37, a minute figure in hand-me-down clothes, finishes first and hands her paper to the teacher. As she leaves, her 11-year-old daughter is arriving for afternoon class. A vegetable farmer who supported, clothed and fed five children, her mother and her grandmother, Chevambo is now living in a borrowed tent in a camp, one of the ones with something to do to fill a few hours.

A Guardian investigation into the state of children‚Äôs services in the last 18 months has revealed a sharp rise in social services referrals during lockdown, plus spiralling costs for mental health support and a bulging backlog in the family courts, with some councils buckling under the weight of the extra work brought by coronavirus.

Sweden‚Äôs only remaining mountaintop glacier, which until 2019 was also its highest peak, lost another two metres in height in the past year due to rising air temperatures driven by climate change, Stockholm University says.
In 2019, the south peak of the Kebnekaise massif was demoted to second in the rankings of Swedish mountains after a third of its glacier melted. Kebnekaise‚Äôs north peak, where there is no glacier, is now the highest in the Nordic country.

Bolivia‚Äôs recent interim government came to power by sidestepping constitutional rules for presidential succession and persecuted opponents with ‚Äúsystematic torture‚Äù and ‚Äúsummary executions‚Äù by security forces in the tumultuous aftermath of Evo Morales‚Äôs resignation in 2019, according to a new report by independent human rights experts.
The scathing 471-page report is the most comprehensive yet to examine the events surrounding the disputed 2019 presidential vote, when Morales‚Äôs narrow election to an unprecedented fourth term triggered widespread protests spurred by strong international allegations of voting fraud ‚Äì claims later questioned by foreign electoral experts.

Peru‚Äôs foreign minister has resigned after footage emerged in which he suggested that a Maoist rebel group that killed tens of thousands of Peruvians had received support from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), making him the first cabinet member to fall under leftist President Pedro Castillo.
Hector Bejar, 85, who in his youth participated in a socialist guerrilla movement, had said he believed the Shining Path rebel group had emerged in part because of backing from the US Central Intelligence Agency.

The coup on 25 April 1974 toppled 48 years of authoritarian fascist rule and brought about the transition to democracy. With a population of nine million, of which a quarter of adults were illiterate, Portugal was the most impoverished country in western Europe.

Police increasingly believe that anti-women propaganda may have fuelled anger in the Plymouth gunman before his attack, with his links to the ‚Äúincel‚Äù movement a main strand of their investigation.
Jake Davison, 22, shot dead his mother and four other people on 12 August. It emerged that he had engaged with extremist ideology including the ‚Äúinvoluntary celibate‚Äù movement, though this is not considered to be enough for security officials to declare the mass shooting as a terrorist attack. Counter-terrorism officers continue to aid the investigation as detectives trawl through the attacker‚Äôs electronic devices.

                    <span>The fall of Kabul to the Taliban should spark a more honest debate about the UK‚Äôs unconditional support for US plans
The UK‚Äôs latest Afghan war, the fourth since 1839, has ended in failure. There is no consolation in claiming that this shameful retreat was down to a bungled withdrawal of US forces by Joe Biden. Britain scuttled out at the same time, the prime minister telling MPs on the day of Mr Biden‚Äôs announcement that ‚Äúthere is no military path to victory for the Taliban‚Äù. As events subsequently proved, Boris Johnson‚Äôs assessment of the situation was badly wrong. The extent of the military and political catastrophe for the UK that the blitzkrieg Taliban takeover represents is hard to overstate.
The UK is currently driven by a desire to stay close to the US. But America is a superpower, able to shrug off defeats and move on. The blow of losing Kabul is felt more deeply in a Britain shorn of substantial global influence. This has led the UK to take Washington‚Äôs lead in military affairs. In Afghanistan, the US judgment that a combination of special forces, local proxies and air power would wipe out domestic resistance to a military occupation was flawed. The Afghan security forces that Nato trained were exposed as a shell. In 20 years, according to Brown University‚Äôs Costs of War project, more than 170,000 Afghans have lost their lives. The death toll was rising. In June almost 1,000 Afghans were killed in the simmering civil war. A few weeks later half the country was under Taliban control.

In Europe, these cities are often places with long histories that morphed into industrial, commercial or trading hubs. Cities like Hamburg, Lyon and Turin can perhaps be seen in this way.
In Belgium, Antwerp is one of the most striking examples of this phenomenon of simultaneous fame and neglect. Antwerp is one of the great historic cities of Europe. In a highly readable new book, Michael Pye argues that, during Europe‚Äôs ages of discovery, it became one of the earliest genuinely global cities too. For much of the 16th century, it was what Paris, New York or London would become in later times, a place of restless wealth and vigour where, as Mr Pye puts it, anything could happen or at least anything could be believed.

Afghanistan crisis: live updates

On 1 October 2001, three weeks after the 9/11 attacks and six days before the bombing of Afghanistan began, there was a small protest march in Washington.
The marchers wore badges saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Turn Tragedy into War‚Äù and ‚ÄúOur Grief Is Not a Cry for War‚Äù, and argued that war was not the inevitable response to the terrorist outrage.

Kane was absent from Tottenham‚Äôs opening-weekend victory against Manchester City on Sunday after being required to isolate following his return from holiday in the Bahamas, via Florida, and the Spurs head coach, Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo,  said afterwards that he expected the 28-year-old to ‚Äúget ready and help the team‚Äù in the play-off against the Portuguese side Pa√ßos de Ferreira on Thursday night.

Sunak is understood to be considering telling Britain‚Äôs 12 million state pension claimants that the pandemic has artificially inflated the official wages figures and a new formula is needed to calculate the rise in the basic state pension for next year.

When Adam Crozier arrived to run Royal Mail 18 years ago, during a time of turmoil and industrial unrest, he confessed to a taste for difficult roles. It‚Äôs a tendency he once described as ‚Äúthrawn‚Äù, a Scots word meaning difficult or intractable.
The role in fact required considerable political skills in managing ministers ‚Äì the Royal Mail was still government-owned ‚Äì and a unionised workforce. Crozier will need those diplomatic skills once more as he takes the chair at BT, the former telecoms monopoly, to balance the demands of regulators and an array of heavyweight investors. BT‚Äôs board will be hoping the 57-year-old enjoys a smoother relationship with BT‚Äôs chief executive Philip Jansen ‚Äì three years his junior ‚Äì than the previous chairman.

England, turbocharged by Joe Root‚Äôs unbeaten 180, scored 391 in their first innings, but across the match they also registered seven ducks including ‚Äì for the first time on home soil ‚Äì both openers in the same innings on that wild final afternoon.

Serious comic book fans and discerning cinephiles consider director Joel Schumacher‚Äôs Batman &amp; Robin from 1997 one of the worst films ever made ‚Äì but they are wrong. It‚Äôs easily more entertaining than Christopher Nolan‚Äôs feted Batman trilogy (come at me Nolanites) ‚Äì an endlessly quotable and absurd corporate climate change parable and the source of teenage mania among my early 2000s high school friends.
The intensely silly caper is more reminiscent of the 60s TV show, and Silver Age comics, than the brooding 80s publications that inspired Nolan and everyone since. Fans were understandably upset with the film‚Äôs reduction of Bane (one of Batman‚Äôs most intelligent foes) to a witless henchman; but in The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan and Tom Hardy turned Bane into a helium-fuelled, amateur Shakespearean actor, so, whatever.

                    <span>We call for visas, safe exit and humanitarian care for those now in need

This is an edited version of an open letter to Boris Johnson


With the Taliban now in full control of Afghanistan, women in the country face particular risk to their lives. As women‚Äôs rights and civil society organisations, we have been in touch with a number who have already received death threats. Some have the Taliban at their doors already. There is a particular risk to those who have acted to make a fundamental difference to what it means to be a woman or girl in Afghanistan: those brave enough to hold public office or start women‚Äôs rights organisations, those who have tirelessly spearheaded grassroots advocacy efforts and those fearless enough to hold decision-makers to account through their journalism. Some, through their work, have played a visible, enabling role in helping the British government achieve its own objectives. As a direct result of this exposure, these women now face a high and imminent risk to their lives.
Along with other civil society organisations working with partners in Afghanistan, we write with urgent concern about this risk. Collectively, we call on the British government to take action immediately. First, to work closely with governments of neighbouring countries and other international powers to ensure safe and legal exit from the country for women and their families at risk of imminent danger. This would include providing visas for and assisting with the escort and evacuation of Afghan women at risk. The government must work hard to ensure the country‚Äôs land borders stay open to evacuations and to facilitate aid, including supporting safe houses and gender-based violence services for women and their families who cannot flee.

                    <span>Readers on 20 years of the ‚Äòwar on terror‚Äô, the withdrawal of western forces and the rapid return of the Taliban
The fall of Kabul this week dramatically underlines the extent to which the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù ‚Äì launched by George Bush and Tony Blair 20 years ago ‚Äì has failed (US troops to stay until Americans and eligible Afghans evacuated, says Biden, 16 August). Stop the War argued from our foundation in October 2001 that the war in Afghanistan would neither end terrorism nor establish a peaceful and democratic state. Twenty years on, despite vast political, military and financial support from the US and Britain, the Kabul government proved a Potemkin regime.
Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The trillion-dollar cost of the war would have been better spent providing education, development and infrastructure. The Afghan people have now endured decades of war, largely imposed on them by western politicians. We must provide financial compensation and aid, not least by welcoming those who want to come here as refugees. We must also insist that our own government and MPs face up to the failures of the past two decades and call an end to the wars and interventions which have done so much damage across the world. Time for a different, peaceful course.

I was really disheartened to read recent attacks on civil servants by an unnamed cabinet minister (Civil servants working from home not at risk of pay cut, says Kwarteng, theguardian.com, 9 August). These constant verbal assaults and the implication that civil servants don‚Äôt work hard enough ‚Äì that if we‚Äôre not in the office we must be watching television ‚Äì are not only unequivocally false, but they‚Äôre damaging what morale is left in the civil service.
I‚Äôm a mid-ranking civil servant in the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. Like the majority of my colleagues, I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months trying to juggle the needs of my day job with working on Covid management. It‚Äôs not my purpose to moan about this ‚Äì I‚Äôm well aware that compared to the horrific experiences of medical staff and the pressures they‚Äôve been under, we‚Äôve had it easier than many. Still, I‚Äôve seen colleagues regularly working 15- or 16-hour days or even longer, particularly at the peak of the pandemic. My colleagues set up the shielding scheme from scratch and at breakneck speed to make sure the most vulnerable in society were protected. Mortgage holidays, the ban on tenant evictions, facilitating the Everyone In campaign for homeless people ‚Äì we‚Äôve done all this and so much more while carrying on with the bulk of business as usual, establishing new schemes including First Homes and progressing building safety policy to try to address the horror revealed by the Grenfell tragedy.

In 2019, Mara‚Äôs weekly performance review meetings grew intolerable; she would sit in a cramped conference room with her supervisors only to be told that she wasn‚Äôt performing well enough. ‚ÄúI felt like a child,‚Äù says Mara, who is 48, lives in Hampshire and works and works as a public servant. ‚ÄúThey would tell me off. They‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt meet this deadline, will you? You didn‚Äôt put a paragraph in this document.‚Äô‚Äù
A year earlier, Mara had had a hysterectomy, to alleviate her endometriosis.

                    <span>He‚Äôs not an established artist ‚Äì or critically acclaimed. Yet his works are apparently being sold for surprising amounts
It looks like the prodigal son is a painter now. Hunter Biden, Joe Biden‚Äôs child, has apparently been dabbling with paints for years. Now his hobby has turned serious: starting soon, you can pick up one of his colourful creations from a gallery in New York‚Äôs SoHo. It will cost you, though: the pieces are reportedly priced between $75,000 and $500,000.
Who parts with that much cash for the work of a new, not exactly critically acclaimed, painter? We may never know. Hunter‚Äôs new career raises obvious ethical issues for his father and, in an attempt to avoid accusations of influence peddling, the Biden administration has asked the gallerist to keep all information about the buyers and prices of Hunter‚Äôs work confidential. The gallery has also agreed to reject offers that seem suspiciously generous.

United Airlines has asked its employees to not use duct tape to restrain unruly passengers.
In a memo sent to employees last Friday, United flight attendants were urged to ‚Äúplease remember that there are designated items onboard that may be used in difficult situations, and alternative measures such as tape should never be used‚Äù.

Classrooms in England need air filters and monitoring devices fitted to protect children from Covid-19 and avoid further disruption to their learning, school unions have told the education secretary, Gavin Williamson.
The seven unions ‚Äì representing teachers, school leaders, administrative and support staff ‚Äì have written to Williamson asking for ‚Äúurgent action‚Äù to improve ventilation when schools reopen for the autumn term without any requirement for children to wear masks or be grouped in ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù.

                    <span>This week‚Äôs victory by the Taliban in Afghanistan now stands as an inspiration to militants around the world
Although the anti-war mood deepened in the UK in 2002, as President George W Bush moved to terminate the regime in Iraq, there had already been some unease the previous October, before the Afghan war started. One policy paper, which I co-authored, even argued against it, pointing to an inevitable escalation and the risk of never-ending war. But for the most part the defence establishment offered support.
In the event, the Taliban fell in a matter of weeks and Bush could announce, in his 2002 state of the union address, an expanded war against an ‚Äúaxis of evil‚Äù, with Iraq first in the sights. Even by mid-2002 the US, UK and others had moved on from Afghanistan, leaving a dangerous security vacuum, which was filled by a returning Taliban, across many rural districts, ultimately setting in motion the events that culminated in the past few days.

                    <span>Across a sprawling internet community, an ideology of violent misogyny is spreading ‚Äì with tragic, ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô results
The term ‚Äúinvoluntary celibate‚Äù, or incel for short, used to describe somebody who isn‚Äôt having sex but would like to be, was first coined by a young woman named Alana in the mid-1990s. The small, supportive, mixed-sex community she created online is a world apart from the extremist, hate-fuelled ideology it has transformed into in the many years since she left those online spaces behind. ‚ÄúIt feels like being the scientist who figured out nuclear fission and then discovers it‚Äôs being used as a weapon for war,‚Äù she later told the Guardian.
Today‚Äôs incels are not a clearly defined, organised group, but rather a sprawling, disparate community of men across a network of blogs, forums, websites, private members groups, chatrooms and social media channels. Several of the forums have memberships in the tens of thousands, with around a 25% increase in membership in the two years I have been researching them. And these figures don‚Äôt take into account the number of people visiting and being influenced by these sites without necessarily signing up.

‚ÄòWe have a chance against any Champions League opponent‚Äô

The Arsenal women‚Äôs head coach, Jonas Eidevall, says he aims to win the Champions League during his time at the club, and that the challenge was fundamental in his decision to join from the Swedish club Rosengard.
Arsenal return to the top table on Wednesday after missing out in six of the past seven seasons. They will face the Kazakh side Okzhetpes in the semi-final of a mini play-off tournament staged in Moscow; the winners will face PSV Eindhoven or Lokomotiv Moscow on Saturday for a place in the second round of qualifying, which feeds into a new-look group stage.

On YouTube, you can see Manny Jacinto getting the surprise of his life. During a break from filming, the stars of The Good Place are informed of the smash-hit comedy‚Äôs mind-boggling plot twist. Castmate Jameela Jamil covers her face with her hands. William Jackson Harper shouts out loud. Jacinto jerks his head around frantically, as if trying to make sense of this astonishing development purely through the power of repetitive neck movement.
‚ÄúI wish I could bottle up that feeling and have everybody experience it,‚Äù says Jacinto wistfully, five years later. ‚ÄúIt was incredible.‚Äù Fans of the heaven-set sitcom will know what he means: the revelation was up there with the best plot twists of all time (spoiling it would be a crime). Yet for Jacinto the show did far more than pull the rug from under him. Winning the role of nice-but-ridiculously-dim DJ Jason Mendoza sent shockwaves through his entire life, catapulting the 33-year-old from relative obscurity to the kind of stardom that invariably accompanies a Netflix success story.

But for those who took the plunge, leaving behind everything and everyone they know in return for a garden and a spare room, the pandemic has not made it easy to meet people in a new area.

                    <span>Martin Tugwell says UK government must look at whether to make car use pricier and public transport cheaper
There needs to be an ‚Äúhonest conversation‚Äù about making driving more expensive in order to subsidise public transport, according to the new head of the north of England‚Äôs strategic transport body.
Martin Tugwell, who took over as chief executive of Transport for the North (TfN) earlier this month, is trying to persuade the government to pay at least ¬£30bn to build a transpennine rail line called Northern Powerhouse Rail, as well as HS2 spurs to Manchester and Leeds.

‚Ä¢ Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com
I love stuffed peppers and tomatoes on continental holidays, but I‚Äôm going to miss them this year because of our staycation. How can I replicate the taste? 
Dan, Birmingham
Stuffed veg have a lot going for them: they couldn‚Äôt be easier to make, they can be served warm or at room temperature, they work with grilled fish, meat, salads or solo, and, perhaps most importantly, they always bring the holiday vibes. Essentially, we should all be getting, er, stuffed right about now.

In a statement, the board of Notting Hill Carnival Ltd said it had decided this year‚Äôs event in London ‚Äúwill not be on the streets due to the ongoing uncertainty and risk Covid-19 poses‚Äù.

The partially mummified remains, including hair and bones, of a former slave who rose through the social ranks have been found in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.
The remains of Marcus Venerius Secundio were found in a tomb at the necropolis of Porta Sarno, which was one of the main entrance gates into the city. The tomb is believed to date back to the decades before Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.

NHS patients are waiting more than three months for tests including MRIs, colonoscopies and heart scans, with overall waiting lists doubling in some parts of England.
The number of people waiting more than three months for tests was 22 times that in 2019 as the health system continues to tackle the Covid pandemic backlog. Almost 124,000 people were kept waiting more than three months in 2021, compared with 5,675 in 2019. It is a slight fall from the May 2021 figure, which stood at just over 127,000.

                    <span>The foreign secretary was on the beach when the Taliban took Kabul. Welcome to Global Britain
What is the role of foreign secretary in the era of Global Britain? News that Dominic Raab was spotted lounging on a beach in Crete on the day Kabul fell certainly sends a message. The suspicion must be that the position of foreign secretary has key similarities with that of England football captain, which is of course a non-operational role roughly on a par with that of regimental goat.
For many years, people were positively obsessed with what sort of person should be England football captain, as though it remotely mattered which player pulled on the armband. It‚Äôs not cricket, or even rugby. The position of England football captain has simply never been used to influence a football match, yet as recently as a decade ago was being discussed as though it were one of the great offices of state, with its holder saying as much about our place in the world as about whether ‚Äúthe lads‚Äù had or hadn‚Äôt given it their all ‚Äúout there‚Äù. The Italians simply give the captaincy to the oldest player on the pitch, which is perhaps something the British government might consider with the Foreign Office.

Getting drunk or looking for love, Florence Espeut-Nickless‚Äôs character commands the space, finding hope amid despair

Destiny is preparing for a big Thursday night out in rural Wiltshire. She leads us to her local nightclub, Karma, where the drinks are 50p and the evening will ultimately go sour, setting her on a path of desperate longing for love.
Though her existence is littered with misfortune ‚Äì including distant parenting, limited finances and sexual abuse ‚Äì she is full of hope. She has faith that things will get better. She dreams of showbiz and of being an MTV Base backing dancer. Her fantasies are long-lasting, her resilience inbuilt.
It is difficult not to warm to Destiny, written and performed by Florence Espeut-Nickless in a monologue directed by Jesse Jones, presented online for the Edinburgh fringe and supported by the Pleasance and by Bristol Old Vic‚Äôs Ferment programme. Despite her surface-level confidence, there is a naivety to her storytelling. As she repeatedly makes decisions that end in inevitable pain, she manages to find humour in her darkest moments ‚Äì and you can‚Äôt help but laugh along, even if it‚Äôs at her fantasies about a TV presenter while she is having sex with a man much older than her. 
The spare set, designed by Joseff Harris, features quick-changing lights and a single chair: we‚Äôre almost completely reliant on Espeut-Nickless‚Äôs ability to command the room. This filmed version is performed to a live audience, and Destiny‚Äôs spirit is engaging early on. 
If her story is one we‚Äôve probably heard before, it doesn‚Äôt make it any less authentic ‚Äì and it is captivatingly told in the West Country vernacular of Destiny‚Äôs community. With endearing personality, she does them proud.
Destiny is available online and live at Bristol Tobacco Factory theatres, 7-8 September.

Poland has told the European Union it will shut down a chamber at its supreme court devoted to disciplining judges, an issue that has been at the heart of a dispute between Warsaw and Brussels.
The Polish government said on Tuesday that it had sent a letter to the European Commission on Monday, the deadline for Warsaw to inform the EU‚Äôs executive branch of how it would proceed after the EU‚Äôs top court said the chamber undermined judicial independence and contravened EU law.

Articles claiming that the pandemic was a hoax, that it was caused by 5G, that it could be cured by hydroxychloroquine or alternative medicine were going viral across the continent ‚Äì part of a global phenomenon the World Health Organization warned was becoming an ‚Äúinfodemic.‚Äù Kartte and colleagues in StratCom, the EU diplomatic service‚Äôs strategic communications division, could detect what they say were patterns of Covid-denier and anti-vaxxer disinformation linked to Russia and to a lesser extent China, being disseminated in several languages across Europe.

Kinloch Castle on the Isle of Rum was completed in 1900 as a playground for the wealthy textile heir Sir George Bullough, and now NatureScot ‚Äì formerly Scottish Natural Heritage ‚Äì can‚Äôt afford the costs of upkeep. That‚Äôs hardly surprising. Every detail of this building oozes extravagance: the exterior stonework has crenellations upon crenellations, while the interior was described by John Betjeman as ‚Äúan undisturbed example of pre-1914 opulence‚Äù.
NatureScot is caught in an unenviable bind between an obligation to maintain an A-listed building and an inability to justify the profligacy it demands. To resolve this contradiction, a new owner is now being sought, someone with deep pockets who can preserve the castle while minimising its impact on the local environment, and contribute to the sustainability of the Rum community.

When you‚Äôre on Broadway and suddenly find out that your show is closing, you feel this wave of sadness. As a cast member, there was nothing you could have done to save it. You didn‚Äôt write the script; you didn‚Äôt call the shots. You just had to show up, and smile, and dance, and perform, and give it your all every day. Your cast has become like your family, the theatre like your home, and your dressing room like your own personal bedroom in that house, your space filled with photos, cards, and memories. After your last show, you have to take that all down, pack everything into a box, and walk out of the theatre as it goes dark.

It happens every Boxing Day. While much of Britain is still sleeping off the previous day‚Äôs excesses, or blearily stripping a turkey carcass, the queues start building for the Next sale.
Loyal online customers get VIP slots to preview the bargains online; for everyone else, it‚Äôs shivering outside the shop at dawn. Even when Covid plunged Leicester into tier 3 restrictions last year, a masked and distanced line of about 200 still formed outside the city‚Äôs flagship store before 6am.

Afghans hoping to escape Taliban rule have gathered in Kabul, with many making desperate attempts to flee.

Many thousands of people may have isolated unnecessarily because a government error meant they were ‚Äúpinged‚Äù by the Covid app for a ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù in the prior five days rather than two days, a Whitehall whistleblower has told the Guardian.
As the isolation rules for double vaccinated people were relaxed on Monday, it has emerged that users were never told the app could notify of contact with an infected person as far back as five days before the positive test.

Swiss researchers have spent 108 days calculating pi to a new record accuracy of 62.8tn digits.
Using a computer, their approximation beat the previous world record of 50tn decimal places, and was calculated 3.5 times as quickly. It‚Äôs an impressive and time-consuming feat that prompts the question: why?

Last month, I spent five days walking across the Peak District during that wonderful week of searing heat. Along the way, I ran into one tired-looking older gentleman who had no map and a scrounged bottle of water, a group of ‚Äúlads‚Äù with an insufficient tourist map and no plan, and a lady unable to read her map.
More than ever before, Britons are flocking to mountains, rivers and wild places. That is a great thing, of course, but the price of entry doesn‚Äôt come without risk.
Instead of sneering at my brief trail friends in the Peak District, I advised where I could and cheered them on their way. The outdoors has enough know-it-all gatekeepers as it is. But had I been able to sit down ‚Ä¶</span>

Water problems ‚Äì drought, with its accompanying wildfires, and flooding ‚Äì are likely to become much worse around the world as climate breakdown takes hold, according to the biggest assessment of climate science to date.
Global heating of at least 1.5C is likely to happen within the next two decades, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Temperature rises will be accompanied by big changes in the planet‚Äôs water cycle, with areas that are already wet becoming much wetter, and already arid areas becoming prone to greater drought. Extreme rainfall intensifies by 7% for each additional 1C of global heating, the report found.

                    <span>The zones can occur on a large scale, as at the equator, or at local level, causing showers and storms
Convergence zones are meteorological boundaries where two flows meet, forcing air upwards. This vertical movement of air leads to the formation of clouds, and heavy precipitation often follows on.
Convergence zones are a global phenomenon and can occur on a large scale, with one such example being the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ for short. The ITCZ is an area around the equator where the northern and southern hemisphere trade winds meet, creating huge amounts of uplift resulting in a band of heavy rain and thunderstorms around the equator. The ITCZ influences the wet and dry seasons in the equatorial region, including the monsoons.

As chaotic scenes unfolded more than 4,000 miles away in Kabul, veterans of the 20-year conflict and families who lost loved ones on the battlefield have been asking the stark question: ‚ÄúWas it worth it?‚Äù

                    <span>A look back at the official photographs of Obama‚Äôs presidency shows his skill at conjuring a sense of pride and possibility ‚Äì but today his victories seem narrow indeed
From the beginning, Obama‚Äôs team was invested in constructing a certain image of what would be deemed a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù presidency. During Obama‚Äôs campaign, the artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the famous ‚ÄúHope‚Äù poster, was widely acknowledged as his key iconographer. But, in retrospect, who Obama was and what he represented endures in the public imagination thanks to the work of the White House photographer Pete Souza, a longtime photojournalist who first had the assignment under Ronald Reagan. Over time, Souza helped create a new image of race in the US. This was an image of a postracial nation, where postracial didn‚Äôt mean liberation ‚Äì it meant a US where race was solely affect and gesture, rather than the old brew of capital, land and premature death. Progress would deposit us in a place where black would be pure style ‚Äì a style that the ruling class could finally wear out.
In the thick of the 2008 primary, in an essay titled Native Son, George Packer argued that after a half century when ‚Äúrightwing populism has been the most successful political force in America‚Äù, there was finally hope for an alternative. ‚ÄúObama is a black candidate,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwho can tell Americans of all races to move beyond race.‚Äù The ensuing years bore out the impossibility of that widely held belief, but it was already evident in the language. How could a single person be black and capable of moving everybody beyond race?

                    <span>The departure of US forces was followed by a rout of Afghan government forces. Now, after 20 years of western intervention, Afghanistan is back under the control of the Taliban
It began with a steady trickle of military defeats. First Afghan government control was ceded to the Taliban in provincial towns and cities. Then, as the lack of resistance became apparent, bigger cities and regional capitals began to fall. Finally on Sunday the Taliban entered Kabul as the western-backed government fled the country. 
The Guardian‚Äôs senior international correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, tells Michael Safi that it marks a stunning reversal for the Afghan government, which had begun negotiating a deal with the Taliban in recent months. And as deeply flawed as the government in Kabul has been for the past 20 years, it has created space for the education of girls and a free press. All of that is now in grave doubt as Afghans wait to see whether their new Taliban rulers plan to carry on where they left off in 2001. We hear voices from inside Afghanistan including reporter Zahra Joya, who was a child when US forces invaded in 2001 and drove out the Taliban. She describes her fears for what will come next.

The government has published its long-awaited plans for a UK-wide hydrogen economy, which it says could be worth ¬£900m and create more than 9,000 high-quality jobs by the end of the decade, rising to ¬£13bn and 100,000 new jobs by 2050.

US politics ‚Äì live coverage

A defiant Joe Biden has insisted that he stands ‚Äúsquarely behind‚Äù his decision to pull US forces rapidly out of Afghanistan while attempting to shift blame for events unfolding there to his predecessor, Donald Trump, and the unwillingness of Afghan forces to fight the Taliban.
Biden is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the stunning fall of Afghanistan to the extremist insurgent force caught his administration flat-footed and raised fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.

                    <span>Evans refuses pre-match handshake with Allen
Allen eventually wins tightly fought first-round encounter 3-2

Any notion that the most extraordinary grudge match in snooker history would fail to live up to the pre-game billing was dispelled before a ball had even been potted. Snooker has had its fair share of eagerly anticipated showdowns in recent times but none have had a backdrop and subplot quite like this one. In the end, the match delivered just as much as the drama did.
How Barry Hearn, snooker‚Äôs grand supremo and lover of any off-baize action that generates publicity, must have grinned when Reanne Evans refused Mark Allen‚Äôs offer of a handshake before the break-off in their first-round match at the British Open in Leicester. There is, of course, way more to this story than ranking points, prize money or head-to-head meetings on the table but even that lit the touch-paper in a way nobody could have imagined.

The 23-year-old missed Wimbledon but returned to action for the Olympics in her native Japan, and agreed to take part in her first press conference in almost three months on Monday.

Three-quarters of people in the world‚Äôs wealthiest nations believe humanity is pushing the planet towards a dangerous tipping point and support a shift of priorities away from economic profit, according to a global survey.
The Ipsos Mori survey for the Global Commons Alliance (GCA) also found a majority (58%) were very concerned or extremely concerned about the state of the planet.

Officials have declared a dire water shortage at Lake Mead, the US‚Äôs largest reservoir, triggering major water cuts in Arizona and other western states. The US Bureau of Reclamation‚Äôs first-ever declaration of a ‚Äútier 1‚Äù shortage represents an acknowledgment that after a 20-year drought, the reservoir that impounds the Colorado River at the has receded to its lowest levels since it was created in the 1930s.
Already, the lake is at about 35% capacity ‚Äì the white ‚Äúbathtub ring‚Äù that lines its perimeter indicates where the water level once was. The lake‚Äôs level is projected to fall even lower by the end of the year, prompting cutbacks in January 2022, the Bureau of Reclamation announced Monday.

Ollie Robinson emerges from the darkness of the Long Room on his way out to the middle. England are 90 for seven and Robinson is about to face the hat-trick ball from Mohammed Siraj. All around the ground, India fans are in raptures. Standing at first slip, Virat Kohli is waving his arms, conducting them like an orchestra. The prevailing smell is of English blood.
As Robinson descends the pavilion steps, a couple of India players in tracksuits are coming back in the opposite direction, having just been out on the field delivering drinks. Robinson stops and waits for them to step aside. They do not step aside. Robinson waits. They wait. Eventually, after a fashion, they sort of awkwardly squeeze past each other. The whole encounter lasts barely a couple of seconds and yet as a motif for this bruising, absorbing final day it is hard to beat.

The streets of Kabul were emptied of women on Monday, the first full day of Taliban rule across Afghanistan, as Taliban gunmen patrolled in cars seized by police, confiscated guns from security guards and urged shopkeepers and government employees back to work.
Chaos unfolded at the airport, where troops used guns and helicopters to clear the runways, and several people died in frantic last-minute attempts to escape by clinging to departing planes.

There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines raise the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth or affect fertility and the ability to have children, the UK‚Äôs health regulator said on Monday.
Data gathered so far also does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and Covid vaccines, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It said the menstrual changes reported post-vaccine were mostly transient in nature: ‚ÄúThe number of reports of menstrual disorders and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to both the number of people who have received Covid vaccines to date and how common menstrual disorders are generally.‚Äù

                    <span>A reckless western withdrawal timetable has let a people down
Earlier this year, a bipartisan panel appointed by the US Congress advised against the ‚Äúprecipitous withdrawal‚Äù of American troops from Afghanistan. The panel warned of grave consequences if Joe Biden allowed himself to be driven by dates and a strict timeline, rather than a realistic assessment of conditions on the ground. Mr Biden, who had inherited a 1 May exit deadline from Donald Trump, ignored this advice, naming instead a new date. All US forces would be gone by 11 September, exactly two decades after the invasion prompted by the al-Qaida attack on the World Trade Center.
A timetable bound up with domestic political symbolism has handed over Afghanistan to the Taliban and millions of Afghans to a frightening and unstable future. In the spring, a Biden administration official said: ‚ÄúWe went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked us on September 11th ‚Ä¶ We believe we achieved that objective some years ago.‚Äù These words were presumably intended to convey a pragmatic determination to end a ‚Äúforever war‚Äù, as well as a neat sense of narrative closure. Today they read like an insular, inward-looking rationale for an abdication of responsibility that will scar the Biden presidency.

                    <span>Many people have mixed feelings about arachnids, but like many more popular animals they need our help
Much less visible for most of the year, spiders make their presence felt in late August and through the early autumn. This is the mating season of some of the most common varieties, when male house spiders come out of hidden corners to look for females, and garden spiders reach adult size and spin their biggest, most dazzling webs.
Yet while the spider is familiar, the star of one of the great children‚Äôs books, Charlotte‚Äôs Web, and a fixture of nursery rhymes and Halloween decor, its relationship with humans is complicated. Fear of spiders, arachnophobia, is common and has serious impacts on the lives of sufferers. Its prevalence appears unrelated to any rational assessment of risk. Spiders in the UK are almost all harmless. Farmland species perform valuable ecosystem services, by predating on insects that are our competitors for crops. But they have proved durable repositories of human anxieties ‚Äì with a cultural association with witches and wickedness dating back to the middle ages.

Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward‚Äôs third book about Donald Trump will be called Peril, completing a trilogy begun with Fear and Rage. According to its publisher, it will also include sections on the first months of Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency.
Woodward rose to fame in the early 1970s, working with Carl Bernstein to uncover the Watergate scandal which brought down Richard Nixon. Peril is another co-production, this time with Robert Costa, also on staff at the Post.

A Turner prize-nominated investigative group has said it is pulling an exhibition of its work at the Whitworth gallery in Manchester after a statement of solidarity with Palestine was removed from the display.
Part of the exhibition addresses violence used by Israeli forces against Palestinians and was accused of being ‚Äúincendiary and by its very nature one-sided‚Äù by UK Lawyers For Israel (UKLFI) which advocates for Israeli causes.

Boris Johnson is coming under pressure from his own MPs to urgently set up a new resettlement scheme for Afghan refugees, amid fears that people with links to the west and high-profile women will be targeted by the Taliban.
Damian Green, the former cabinet minister, led Conservative calls for the UK to allow refugees safe passage to Britain, while Labour leader Keir Starmer and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon pressed for a programme to accommodate them.

In the opening scenes of Hibernation, a minister from Australia‚Äôs ruling conservative party updates the parliament of 2030 on the unfolding climate crisis. Regional Australia is riddled with ghost towns, whole nations are underwater, and there‚Äôs a flood of climate refugees lapping at our still-shut borders. ‚ÄúEverybody is the victim of what is happening to our planet,‚Äù spits the unsubtly named Warwick Joyce (Mark Saturno), ‚Äúand everybody is the culprit‚Äù.
His answer? A miracle sleeping agent first developed for the colonisation of space that can plunge human beings into a deep, perfect slumber. But rather than using the gaseous drug to aid an exodus from our doomed planet, Joyce says, why not force the entire human race to sleep ‚Äì to collectively take our foot off the gas ‚Äì for one year?

Twenty-one years, 567 games, eight leagues, eight cups and four European Cups later, a World Cup and a Euros too, he‚Äôs not just still standing; he‚Äôs carrying the club on his shoulders. Well, someone has to.

                    <span>Bill Kingdom says the battle against Covid provides lessons in how to cut consumption to ease global warming. Plus letters from Sue Dalley, David Hughes and Dave Hunter  
In Adam Tooze‚Äôs article (By pushing for more oil production, the US is killing its climate pledges, 13 August), he surmised that economic activity and fossil fuel consumption are hardwired together. It may be more that economic activity and energy consumption are hardwired together ‚Äì and thus the need to move to renewables or low-carbon energy sources. That must be part of the strategy, along with as yet unavailable technical solutions such as carbon capture.
However, we seem to tiptoe around the consumption part of any strategy. Lower consumption results in lower carbon emissions. The government has managed to exert strong influence over personal actions during the Covid pandemic using a myriad of three-word slogans. We need a similar push linked to consumption and climate change.

                    <span>Defeats in Champions League final, Community Shield and at Spurs have exposed a familiar failing but are City prepared to spend ¬£160m to solve it?
The roles were reversed at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday. By the end, with Tottenham sticking to Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo‚Äôs plan after Son Heung-min‚Äôs clever breakaway goal, it was Manchester City who looked like they needed to become the Harry Kane team. Spurs had found a way to play without Kane, striking on the counterattack, and City had allowed the game to run away from them, their lack of conviction in attack a worry despite the presence of a ¬£100m signing making his first start.
Early days, of course, and it is fair to acknowledge that Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side were not at full strength when they began the defence of their title. Context matters in spite of City‚Äôs vast resources and allowances must be made for the absence of Phil Foden, the rustiness of Kevin De Bruyne, and Guardiola levelling the playing field by picking Nathan Ak√© and Benjamin Mendy when John Stones, Kyle Walker and Aymeric Laporte were available.

The Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu has been arrested on suspicion of rape in a high-profile case that followed an accusation that the singer had sexually assaulted a 17-year-old while she was drunk and lured young women into sexual relationships.
The prosecutor‚Äôs office of the Beijing district of Chaoyang said in a one-sentence statement that Wu‚Äôs arrest was formally approved but gave no details of the charges.

French prosecutors have launched hate speech and incitement of violence investigations into antisemitic banners seen at demonstrations against the country‚Äôs coronavirus health pass, which is now required for many daily activities.
At recent anti-health-pass demonstrations, protesters have brandished placards featuring syringes forming swastikas, wearing yellow stars or carrying banners bearing the word ‚ÄúQui?‚Äù (who?), which has emerged as the latest antisemitic slogan of the far right and conspiracy theorists.

Will, a personal assistant working in London, used to avoid coffee shops before lockdown.

Elsewhere in the capital, Daisy Baldwin, a 34-year-old communications manager, has also started buying food and drink during the working day. ‚ÄúI never spent money on lunch or coffee ‚Äì or very occasionally as a rare treat ‚Äì but now I am working from home I like to support my local cafes by buying a sandwich, juice or even an ice-cream one or two times a week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSaving the cost of commuting means I can afford to splash out a bit more and I feel more connected to my local community than pre-pandemic.‚Äù

                    <span>Daniel Raboldt‚Äôs low-budget but visually impressive film has more than a whisper of A Quiet Place about it, as two survivors fight their robotic overlords without making any noise
This plucky Kickstarter-funded German sci-fi from director Daniel Raboldt comes with a distinct whisper of A Quiet Place, as well as Luc Besson‚Äôs almost dialogue-free film The Last Battle. Taking place in a war-against-the-machines future, its purist approach poses a few storytelling challenges, leaving its two protagonists at times gesticulating at each other as if in a post-apocalyptic game of charades.
Tomasz (Stefan Ebel) is a survivor in a man v machine conflict in which the latter are decidedly on top. He hunkers down in an abandoned house in the wilderness, setting up a perimeter forcefield to protect himself. That done, there‚Äôs not much to do other than get high on a weird blue narcotic. But out inspecting his generators one day, he‚Äôs waylaid by Lilja (Siri Nase), a fierce-eyed woman in a pair of Uggs (which, like cockroaches, appear able to survive armageddon). He wakes up bound and gaffer-taped, with her furiously soldering robot parts as though she‚Äôs trying to root out their secrets.

The investigation covers 765,000 vehicles, almost everything that Tesla has sold in the US since the start of the 2014 model year. Of the crashes identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as part of the investigation, 17 people were injured and one was killed.

It was meant to be a leisurely break as Spain sweltered through record-breaking temperatures. But beachgoers in the southern province of Granada inadvertently found themselves in pursuit of a pair of alleged drug smugglers after a cannabis-laden boat careened on to their pebbled shore.
The chase began on Saturday evening after maritime police spotted a suspicious boat off Melicena beach. Police boat in tow, the small vessel headed full tilt towards the beach, seemingly oblivious to the bathers, chairs and umbrellas that dotted the shoreline.

Signing a petition calling on the club to change its membership rules, Blair recalled watching her fellow trainee barrister and future husband Tony Blair being admitted into the club in 1976, while she was shut outside. She described the lack of progress as ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù.

                    <span>Western involvement in the country was a post-imperial fantasy that has led to the current ghastly situation
The fall of Kabul was inevitable. It marks the end of a post-imperial western fantasy. Yet the west‚Äôs reaction beggars belief. Call it a catastrophe, a humiliation, a calamitous mistake, if it sounds good. All retreats from empire are messy. This one took 20 years, but the end was at least swift.
The US had no need to invade Afghanistan. The country was never a ‚Äúterrorist state‚Äù like Libya or Iran. It was not at war with the US; indeed the US had aided its rise to power against the Russians in 1996. The Taliban had hosted Osama bin Laden in his mountain lair through his friendship with the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar. At an immediate post-9/11 ‚Äúloya jirga‚Äù in the southern city of Kandahar, younger leaders pressed the mullah to expel Bin Laden. Pakistan would probably have forced his surrender sooner or later. After the 2001 invasion the US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld demanded that George Bush ‚Äúpunish and get out‚Äù.

NHS England hospitals have sounded the alarm over materials used in roofs that reached the end of their lifespan more than a decade ago, with one hospital forced to restrict the use of some operating theatres to patients under 120kg (19st).
Several hospitals are warning of the potential for roof collapses due to structural weaknesses in the reinforced concrete planks used in their construction between the 1960s and 1980s, which have a 30-year lifespan.

Now I realise it‚Äôs just as likely to be bread with a medjool date whipped butter, or garlic bread with a cheesy crust. In my pride, I have spent ages ordering things that weren‚Äôt there.

I was stunned by the comment as I walked into a recent press conference to warn our south Texas community that, after all we‚Äôve been through for the past 18 months, we need to remain vigilant as new variants of Covid-19 are causing a surge in hospitalizations.
‚ÄúYou were pretty sick last year,‚Äù said a doctor at the press conference, a friend who had treated me when I was hospitalized for 10 days with Covid-19 last July. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were going to make it. You almost died.‚Äù

I adore parmigiana di melanzane, with its layers of sweetly acidic tomato sauce, grilled-until-collapsing aubergine and generous amounts of oozing, stringy cheese. It can, though, feel a little rich to have all on its own, and decidedly too much work for a midweek side dish. While you can get around this easily enough by serving it with a delicious salad, when spinach and chard are bursting out of the ground, I love to wilt them in a little oil and add them in layers to give extra goodness to this comforting dish.

Simon Cowell and Jeremy Clarkson. Sneery Si and shouty Jezza. Together they bestrode 00s primetime, the dad-jeaned embodiment of a midlife crisis. Now the terribly haired pair seem to be morphing into a sort of two-headed televisual monster. Haven‚Äôt we suffered enough?
You could almost hear a nation‚Äôs eyes rolling in unison at the news that Simon Cowell is preparing to launch a new motoring show. According to the tabloids, The Karaoke Sauron (copyright Marina Hyde) is developing a rival to the BBC‚Äôs long-running Top Gear.

The shy new arrivals are joining a menagerie of animals at his rewilding project in Devon. They are in a large pen with a four-metre-high fence but Gow, like a growing number of conservationists, wants to see lynxes prowling freely in the countryside.

Unfortunately, it seems that US population flows are going in the wrong direction ‚Äì new census data shows a nation moving out of the safer areas and into some of the most dangerous places of all.

                    <span>The swift rise of the Chinese video-sharing app could have ramifications for all of us and how we live, both online and off
Against the backdrop of a global pandemic that has kept millions of people inside with nothing but their phones for company, the short-form video-sharing app TikTok has quietly ascended to the top ranks of tech. TikTok was the world‚Äôs most downloaded app last year, and according to App Annie, a mobile analytics company, in March 2020 alone, users spent as much time on it as there has been since the stone age: 2.8bn hours, or nearly 320,000 years. Last month, TikTok became the first app not owned by Facebook to cross the 3bn download mark. For context, there are 5.3bn mobile phone users worldwide.
By now, you‚Äôll almost certainly know the name TikTok, even if you‚Äôve never used it, perhaps through word of mouth from nagging children or grandchildren, or the sheer bombardment of TV adverts over the past year. Parent company ByteDance turned over $34bn in revenue in 2020, and clearly isn‚Äôt shy about spending it to acquire new users: at the Euros this summer, for instance, TikTok‚Äôs logo was emblazoned on every advertising hoarding in sight.

                    <span>There are thousands of names for pasta, but before all came those joyful, humble lumps of dough known as gnocchi. How do you like yours?
‚ÄúIn the beginning was the gnocco.‚Äù When I first read that line by Corrado Barberis, president of Italy‚Äôs National Institute of Rural Sociology, I got slightly hysterical. Let me explain: it was last summer, inordinately hot, and I was holed up in a dark room writing a book about pasta, or rather 50 stories about 50 shapes, and things were not going well. In fact, they were going very badly, and I hated the book, myself and everyone I could hear having what sounded like the time of their lives in the piazza below.
After looking for the answer on social media, then feeling even worse, I picked up the masterpiece that is Oretta Zanini de Vita‚Äôs Encyclopedia Of Pasta. Now, I should add that at the time we were working our way through The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings double trilogy at home, so I may have been influenced by that when I opened it looking for a sign.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

It‚Äôs embarrassing to tell a patient being discharged from hospital that they can‚Äôt be seen for months. Or assure them that you will check with the clinic booking team, when you know there is no capacity. It‚Äôs demoralising to work long hours in A&amp;E only to have more people waiting for treatment than when you started your shift. To know so much of your work in the emergency room would be unnecessary if outpatient services were not stretched beyond their limits.
Damaging waiting times have existed for years, caused by the government‚Äôs refusal to properly fund the NHS. Waiting times for GP and hospital appointments were the second most common reason given in a 2019 King‚Äôs Fund study about why patients were dissatisfied with the NHS. The pandemic has exacerbated this problem. Some 1.2 million people in England have now been waiting over six months for essential services, a figure that is almost five times higher than it was in 2019.

She describes herself as having been a ‚Äúfairly cautious‚Äù parent before the pandemic, but Shannon now worries about her children‚Äôs safety more than ever. ‚ÄúThe pandemic has made me more paranoid and fearful of other people,‚Äù she says. She has two sons, aged seven and four, and she‚Äôs anxious about them falling ill ‚Äúbecause they are too young to get vaccinated‚Äù. When her elder son‚Äôs school reopened last year, she kept him at home. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt go inside other people‚Äôs houses, and, if we have play dates, we do them outside,‚Äù she says. As a hospital chaplain in Indiana, Shannon has seen people dying of Covid, so her fear is understandable.
There have been benefits ‚Äì her sons are closer than ever ‚Äì but she acknowledges the downsides. ‚ÄúThat social aspect of their development is something I‚Äôm definitely worried about.

Though the effects of Covid-19 on the UK‚Äôs community of medieval knights, Roman centurions and Crimea nurses has not made headlines, many re-enactors have been without work since March 2020. Armed with some thankfully odourless props and boundless enthusiasm, Turnbull and his fellow re-enactors are clearly thrilled to be back sharing their passion for British history with the public.

Discharges of raw sewage by Southern Water into a protected natural harbour risk causing an environmental catastrophe, say campaigners.
Chichester harbour in West Sussex is one of the most highly protected marine environments in the country. But the latest analysis from Natural England shows that 80% of its protected habitats are in an unfavourable or declining condition.

                    <span>It‚Äôs time to ditch the old cliches and to change the way we think about Olympic athletes, who are humans rather than robots
Chris Boardman signalled the shift when he summed up British Cycling‚Äôs performance at the Tokyo Olympics: ‚ÄúFewer medals but a better story.‚Äù What could he mean? We all know sporting performance pushes forward. Innovation never stops as athletes look deeper and search further to raise their game. The new territory this time is fresh vocabulary, human stories and different thinking.
The Paralympics are poised to begin, the Beijing Winter Olympics follow next year, with Paris 2024 not so far away. Olympians of different ages and from different nations are challenging us to shift our mindsets and broaden the lens on what we see and take from the Games. Our language as spectators, journalists, politicians or sports leaders needs checking. There was a new vernacular spoken in the performance arenas of Tokyo. Take your favourite most-quoted phrases and question whether an athlete would say them any more. Here‚Äôs three to start:

                    <span>Before they were superstars, Joan Rivers kissed and tried to kill a young Barbra Streisand on stage ‚Äì or so she claimed. Now her tall tale has inspired drama The Funny Girls
In the late 1950s, a 25-year-old struggling actor named Joan Molinsky ‚Äì later to become better known as the acerbic comedian Joan Rivers ‚Äì landed a small part as a lesbian stalker in an off-off-Broadway play called Seaweed. ‚ÄúThe primary qualification for being cast,‚Äù her biographer Leslie Bennetts later wrote, seemed to be ‚Äúthat she had lots of relatives who would come see her in a play‚Äù. The significance of Seaweed from a historical point of view is that she was starring opposite another superstar-in-waiting, whom she described in her memoir Enter Talking as ‚Äúa skinny high school girl with a large nose and a pin that said, ‚ÄòGo Erasmus!‚Äô‚Äù.
This was 17-year-old Barbra Streisand, who played her unlucky victim. Rivers recalled ‚Äúa big love scene in which I told Barbra I loved her very much and she rejected me and I had a knife in my hand and tried to kill her and then myself‚Äù. It‚Äôs delicious to imagine these two future divas in a clinch in some airless New York attic in front of an audience ‚Äúsitting there in overcoats ‚Ä¶ coughing, like a tubercular ward‚Äù, as Rivers put it.

Ten days ago Robyn McCarthy was eagerly preparing for the return of her six-year-old son to in-person classes at his Miami public school at the start of the new school year. After 18 months of grueling lockdown at home, learning through Zoom, it was finally time for the boy to re-enter the world outside.
‚ÄúWe were excited and we were ready,‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd bought the uniforms, we had the masks all ready to go. We felt confident that the school would do a great job in keeping our son and everybody else safe.‚Äù

When a shackled Mansoor Adayfi was lumped on to a heap of shivering, naked bodies in the pitch black, a hood over his head and muffs around his ears, he assumed he was going to die. He had just been conducting research in Afghanistan, and was expecting to begin university at the end of the year. Instead, he was accused of being an al-Qaida leader, kidnapped by Afghan warlords and handed over to the CIA.
He was kept in a prison camp in Afghanistan, then shipped to Guant√°namo Bay. He remained hopeful. Aged 18, coming from a tribal area of Yemen with no electricity or running water, Adayfi did not know much about US values, but he assumed some principles held true in most of the world: that every person should be innocent until proven guilty; that if you have nothing to hide you should tell the truth; and that all humans, regardless of who they are, have rights.

I‚Äôm shaking my pelvis with brio, when a goldendoodle ambles up. Don‚Äôt you poo, I think. Then again, doing what comes naturally is the point of today. My friend Beth has invited me to try 5Rhythms: a silent disco movement meditation class on Clapham Common. I didn‚Äôt understand any of those words, but said yes¬≠, because this column has turned my life into a second-tier Jim Carrey film¬≠. Now I‚Äôm in deep with the hippies. To my left, a man in socks and a bandana is romancing a tree. A nearby game of touch rugby has paused so its players can laugh at us. This is my nightmare.
5Rhythms was developed in the 1970s by Gabrielle Roth, a New York theatre artist, but moved mainstream in the last 15 years, adopted by the wellness crowd. The practice involves dancing to five distinct moods of music, in a specific sequence known as the wave, which corresponds to different aspects of the self. The resulting ‚Äúsoul journey‚Äù is designed to unlock unlimited creativity and wholeness in the psyche of the dancer. Assuming they buy into the new-age framework, that is. My own personal five rhythms are lazy, dissatisfied, hungry, laughing and a freeform malaise I refer to as Kenneth.

                    <span>The hippy movement may have been in decline since its 1960s heyday, but there are still Europeans who choose an alternative lifestyle. During the pandemic, when many people are considering whether there might be a different way to live rather than returning to old ways, journalist Roberto Palomo journeys through Portugal with some of those who are living outside established society
The pandemic disrupted so many people‚Äôs plans, including mine. As a freelance reporter, my scheduled trip through South America in search of stories disappeared and I had to look for alternatives. In spite of everything, I got a job during lockdown in a logistics warehouse and was able to save some money. Once the restrictions began to relax, I bought an old van and, with the help of some friends, adapted it to make it my new home for the next months.
I am from Badajoz, a small city in the south-west of Spain a few kilometres from the Portuguese border. I have been visiting Portugal since I was a child but I never had the opportunity to explore the neighbouring country in more depth. With the world paralysed, this was my chance.

                    <span>The Tories see culture as something that needs to be protected, but it‚Äôs a shifting landscape transformed by each generation
The culture war, much like the war on drugs or the war on terror, is a metaphorical state that seems fated to go on for ever. The left blames the right for instigating a cynical distraction from its economic and public health failures; the right insists it is merely acting in self-defence after years of clandestine advances by the left. The indefinite nature of this battle stems from a general failure to define what is being fought over, or to determine what is meant by culture, where it comes from or why it matters.
One of the people who thought hardest about the idea of ‚Äúculture‚Äù that so preoccupies today‚Äôs culture warriors was Stuart Hall, the sociologist and founding figure of British cultural studies. Hall arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1951 to find a rigidly hierarchical society that was undergoing profound social changes in the aftermath of the second world war. The ‚ÄúWindrush generation‚Äù had been recruited from the far corners of a fragmenting empire to help rebuild a devastated mother country, bringing with them new music, food and language that would reshape Britain‚Äôs atmosphere. At the same time, television, cinema and radio were spreading a new, irreverent image of British culture around the world, while the rise of the welfare state and increasing disposable income among working people meant the audiences for art and sport were growing just as their barriers of entry began to lower.

Born in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Summer of Love, Toloui was in the right place to hit these targets, and by 1990 was a member of a feminist punk band, Yeastie Girlz, and working at the Lusty Lady strip club. Stripping was part-rebellion and part-necessity because Toloui was studying photojournalism at San Francisco State University and the Lusty Lady paid well, but when she was given an assignment to shoot her own life, it also became a project. Deciding not to photograph herself or her colleagues, because female nudes have been seen so many times before, she trained her camera on the customers.

                    <span>Andy Street says the region‚Äôs new Tory voters need concrete policies to match Boris Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äòlevelling up‚Äô pledge
Boris Johnson has been urged by one of the most senior Conservative figures outside London to match the symbolism of his ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù pledge with concrete policies.
Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands, said the prime minister had shown he was ‚Äúnot for turning‚Äù in the face of Tory heartland MPs worried the party would neglect its traditional voters, but pressed him to set out a ‚Äúfull policy platform‚Äù in the coming months.
Fresh from securing an increased majority in the May local elections as one of the few Conservative metro mayors, Street cautioned that the swathes of ‚Äúred wall‚Äù voters who backed the party for the first time in 2019 ‚Äúwant to see delivery‚Äù.
The former John Lewis managing director also called on ministers not to rely totally on public spending to boost the life chances of those in impoverished areas, instead saying that leveraging significant investment by private businesses was ‚Äúthe only way out of this country‚Äôs economic challenge‚Äù.
Speaking from Wolverhampton College, Street conceded the idea behind levelling up was ‚Äúnot completely new‚Äù, instead pioneered by former prime minister David Cameron ‚Äì meaning it had already been ‚Äúin action‚Äù for several years.
However, he praised Johnson for vowing to make it ‚Äúthe defining mission of his government‚Äù and admitted that while a landmark speech Johnson gave in Coventry last month on his priorities as the UK emerged from the pandemic did not contain everything he wanted to hear, he was confident those announcements would come.
Street said: ‚ÄúHe could easily have turned his back on that after Covid. But actually, no, he‚Äôs leaning right into it. And he‚Äôs also telling his party ‚Äì and this was what was so important ‚Äì that that is what the Conservative government‚Äôs going to do.

Boris Johnson‚Äôs delay in publishing the net zero emissions strategy has left a space for climate sceptics to ‚Äúcomplain, attack and undermine‚Äù on cost grounds, and other countries could do with seeing more ‚Äúproper leadership‚Äù from the UK before Cop26, the government‚Äôs independent climate adviser has said.
Lord Deben, the Conservative peer and chair of the climate change committee, said critics of the net zero policy had been vocal in the public debate because ‚Äúit hasn‚Äôt been put into context by the government‚Äù.

A landmark judgment that could bring part of UK law into line with sharia law‚Äôs position on ‚Äúbride price‚Äù payments is to be announced this week in the central London county court, in a case backed by a women‚Äôs charity.
A bride price ‚Äì or mahr ‚Äì is one of the important aspects of an Islamic marriage contract. It is a gift, or a promise of a gift, to the wife by the husband. It is agreed between the parents or guardians of the bride and the groom verbally or in writing shortly before the couple‚Äôs marriage.

Gordon Brown hits out at EU‚Äôs ‚Äòneocolonial approach‚Äô to Covid vaccine supplies

In a shocking symbol of the west‚Äôs failure to honour its promise of equitable vaccine distribution, millions of Covid vaccines manufactured in Africa that should have saved the lives of Africans have been shipped to Europe in recent weeks. Indeed I have learned from African leaders that, this month and next, about 10m single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) vaccines filled and finished at the Aspen factory in South Africa will be exported to Europe, at the very time that Africa is grappling with its deadliest wave of Covid-19 infections yet.
Compared with the swift development of the pathbreaking Covid vaccines, getting shots into all the world‚Äôs arms should be straightforward. But vaccine nationalism ‚Äì and Europe‚Äôs neocolonial approach to global health ‚Äì is dividing the world into rich and protected people, who live, and those who are poor, unprotected and at risk of dying.

UK house prices fell in August amid a drop in demand for bigger homes after the government scaled back its stamp duty tax break for buyers in England and Northern Ireland this summer, according to Rightmove.
The property website said the national average asking price of a home had fallen by 0.3%, or about ¬£1,000, over the past month, and now stood at ¬£337,371. However, it said buyer demand remained strong for smaller properties in particular, and that it was predicting an ‚Äúautumn bounce‚Äù in prices.

Virgil van Dijk says his return to action for Liverpool this summer has felt ‚Äúvery emotional and very tough‚Äù, and that he has jumped a mental hurdle after recovering from 10 months out with anterior cruciate ligament damage.
Liverpool enjoyed a comfortable evening at newly promoted Norwich on Saturday, winning 3-0 and experiencing only occasional alarm at the back. The conditions were ideal for Van Dijk to play his first competitive football since being injured at Everton last October, and he explained that he felt ready after coming through a challenging comeback game last month when Liverpool lost 4-3 against Hertha Berlin in a friendly.

Even the militants themselves were surprised by the speed of the takeover, co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar admitted in a video statement in the evening. Now the group faces the challenge of ruling, he added. They are expected to proclaim a new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan soon.

On a hot, sticky and noisy evening the melancholy was momentarily gone, a cautious optimism taking its place. It has been 17 years, and it is not easy to let go, but for most of the 90 minutes here Barcelona‚Äôs fans did, driven by a kind of collective desire for closure and the performance of their ‚Äúother‚Äù players, two goals from Martin Braithwaite and one each from Sergi Roberto and Gerard Piqu√© taking them to victory.

New coach heartened by Trinity‚Äôs spirit

Willie Poching has been promised an open audition to convince the Wakefield Trinity hierarchy he is the right man to succeed Chris Chester as the club‚Äôs head coach. This was about as impressive an opening gambit as he could have hoped for, even if there was a late reminder of how much of a challenge this job is.
Anything other than a Wakefield win here would have been unfair on the hosts, who dominated large periods of the contest against a Warrington side who were, in their own coach‚Äôs words, ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù in the first half.

Early on Sunday morning I was heading to university for a class when a group of women came running out from the women‚Äôs dormitory. I asked what had happened and one of them told me the police were evacuating them because the Taliban had arrived in Kabul, and they will beat women who do not have a burqa.
We all wanted to get home, but we couldn‚Äôt use public transport. The drivers would not let us in their cars because they did not want to take responsibility for transporting a woman. It was even worse for the women from the dormitory, who are from outside Kabul and were scared and confused about where they should go.

This was Manchester City with the flaws on the outside; this is what they look like when things go wrong, as they have twice before against Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo sides, and weirdly often against Tottenham. Football‚Äôs finances may be ruined and the game sinking into a moral mire but there is still comfort to be drawn from teams, despite it all, remaining resolutely themselves.
City began with great pace and urgency, slicing Spurs open so frequently the game might have been over within 10 minutes. But then having failed to score, the mechanisms became gummed and, more troublingly, they looked extremely vulnerable on the counter‚Äëattack with Lucas Moura a constant menace.

                    <span>Upside down, they resemble a pair of scales
Dragonflies have a near-perfect hunting record, successfully grabbing their prey in mid-air 95% of the time: they do this while flying skywards, earthwards, side to side, backwards and upside down. In one experiment, a dragonfly with numbers drawn on its clear wings alights backwards from a reed, legs raised above its head like a person making an offering to God, and scoops up the bug flying behind it. The dragonfly appears to catch its prey both benevolently and malevolently: snatching it and saving it, like a ball or a falling baby.
Dragonflies transform from their larval stage with similarly precise acrobatics: the skin splits, the insect wriggles its head and chest out with the awkwardness of someone trying to get into a sleeping bag while standing up, and then it hangs upside down for a while, its tail still trapped in the skin. The almost-dragonfly regains its strength, then does an upside down sit-up at the same time it pulls and flicks its tail out: a perfectly controlled dismount, a precisely calibrated monkey acrobat toy.

The Alpecin-Fenix rider timed his surge to the finish line perfectly to pass the UAE Emirates rider Juan Sebasti√°n Molano, who went too early and was easily caught before finishing fourth. The Dutchman Fabio Jakobsen was second with the Australian Michael Matthews third, all crossing the line in 3hr 58min 57sec.

The history of western interference after the second world war in countries throughout the world has been one of unmitigated failure for which we all bear a share of shame (UK and US send troops to aid evacuation from Afghanistan as Taliban advance, 13 August).
Western powers have invaded countries thousands of miles away in the name of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and achieved a vacuum of power that has swiftly been filled by the very forces they went to evict. Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. We have left behind devastation and despair while never learning the lessons of each disaster. If people want a one-party state, why does the US and its poodles think it has a duty or right to impose a very flawed system of democracy on other nations? Hubris followed inevitably by nemesis.

Patrick Butler is right that the pandemic has made the crisis in children‚Äôs social care ‚Äúeven more acute‚Äù (Crisis in children‚Äôs services in England is shocking if not surprising, 11 August). However, it is difficult to see how the government‚Äôs review of children‚Äôs social care will achieve the radical changes needed, for two reasons.
First, it will require a commitment to more progressive taxation and increases in the minimum wage and universal credit to combat major inequalities, including those associated with the rising demand for children‚Äôs and youth services: childhood poverty, social deprivation, homelessness, poor health, ethnicity and disability.

                    <span>Post-Covid, the state can help workers find new jobs in blossoming sectors when old jobs in obsolete ones wither away
Last August, Rishi Sunak was so confident that Covid was banished he said the furlough had to go. About 4 million workers would have either been forced to return to their jobs or found they had no job at all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Mr Sunak told the BBC, ‚Äúto keep people trapped in a situation and pretend there is always a job that they can go back to.‚Äù But it was Mr Sunak who was wrong. The pandemic was not over. A new, more transmissible Covid variant would soon appear. By October 2020 the furlough was back. Such an experience ought to chasten a politician. But that does not appear to be the chancellor‚Äôs style. He talked last week about the economy ‚Äúbouncing back‚Äù. The furlough, he says, will disappear by the end of September. Is Mr Sunak once again tempting fate?
Britain has eased pandemic restrictions, but the country is not out of danger. A more virulent Covid strain could emerge. Mr Sunak, however, is betting that vaccine coverage and booster shots will allow Britons to live with the virus. The chancellor can also draw comfort from the Bank of England, which believes that mass layoffs have been averted and unemployment has peaked. The first week of August saw 1.7m active job ads, while 1.9 million people are on furlough. For some this will mean higher pay and better benefits. It may just be catchup. Half of British workers suffered a real-terms pay cut last year despite a sharp rise in average earnings.

                    <span>How can Britain persuade other countries to ditch fossil fuels when it won‚Äôt do so itself?
Boris Johnson‚Äôs apparent willingness to sign off a new oilfield, Cambo, in the North Sea makes a mockery of his claim to global climate leadership. The first phase of Cambo would produce up to 170m barrels of crude. That is the equivalent, say Friends of the Earth, of the annual emissions of 18 coal-fired power plants. This sends dark clouds scuttling over the UK‚Äôs presidency of Cop26, held in Glasgow in November this year. For the UN climate summit to be a success, Mr Johnson‚Äôs team, headed by Alok Sharma, must cajole recalcitrant countries into line. It is doubtful that Mr Sharma can persuade other nations of the merit of forsaking fossil fuels when Britain will not lead by example.
Last week, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its starkest warning yet about the planetary emergency. To have a 50% chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C requires the world to get net emissions of carbon dioxide down to zero before 2050. In a foreword to the IPCC report, Ant√≥nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote that countries should ‚Äúend all new fossil fuel exploration and production‚Äù. The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental group founded to protect access to hydrocarbons, has said much the same.

Pret a Manger is plotting to expand outside London and other big city centres as large numbers of office workers continue to work from home, with plans to open 100 franchised shops, plus about 100 of its own outlets.
The coffee and sandwich chain has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic as its city centre outlets suffered from the absence of commuters and tourists. But the company said that in some regional towns its shops were busier than they had ever been.

                    <span>American folk-country singer and songwriter best known for Love at the Five and Dime and her album Other Voices, Other Rooms
Greatly admired by her fellow artists and a devoted army of fans, Nanci Griffith, who has died aged 68, exemplified a style of musical storytelling with a literary flavour, focusing on the small details of the lives of her characters. Songs such as Love at the Five and Dime and Gulf Coast Highway have become permanent fixtures in the folk-country canon (Griffith described her music as ‚Äúfolkabilly‚Äù), and the Grammy award she won for her album Other Voices, Other Rooms in 1994 seemed a long overdue reward for her carefully crafted body of work.
While that album comprised versions of other people‚Äôs songs, other artists appreciated the quality of her own material. Love at the Five and Dime, from Griffith‚Äôs album The Last of the True Believers (1986), was a Grammy-nominated country hit for Kathy Mattea, while Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson sang Gulf Coast Highway on Harris‚Äôs hit album Duets (1990). Suzy Bogguss had a country Top 10 hit with Griffith‚Äôs Outbound Plane.

Centre for Cities said the schemes outlined so far by the government were a ‚Äúdrop in the ocean‚Äù and that closing the north-south divide would cost hundreds of billions of pounds over decades if done properly.

                    <span>From Khartoum to Kansas, vaccine conspiracy theorists have one thing in common: they have lost their faith in government

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

It‚Äôs hard to explain what it feels like when someone you thought you knew intimately starts to repeat conspiracy theories about the pandemic and vaccines. You don‚Äôt really grasp what‚Äôs happening immediately: it‚Äôs too vast and jarring a realisation to gulp down in one go. So you go through phases. First you clutch at straws. Perhaps it‚Äôs a bad joke, or they didn‚Äôt really mean it, or they‚Äôre just misinformed. Then you enter a stage of hot, disorienting rage and frustrated remonstration. Once that is spent, finally you cool off. But inside you is a leaden realisation that not only is this person you love putting their life at risk: perhaps you never really knew them at all.
People with the wildest theories about the pandemic can be found in countries even where most people don‚Äôt have access to the internet, cable TV or the shock jocks of commercial radio. A common impulse is to write off those espousing conspiracies, consigning them to the casualties claimed by WhatsApp groups, disinformation or silent mental health issues. These things may be true ‚Äì but vaccine hesitancy is a symptom of broader failures. What all people wary of vaccines have in common, from Khartoum to Kansas, is their trust in the state has been eroded. Without understanding this, we will be fated to keep channelling our frustrations towards individuals without grasping why they have lost trust in the first place.

The Taliban have 80,000 troops in comparison with a nominal 300,699 serving the Afghan government, yet the whole country has been effectively overrun in a matter of weeks as military commanders surrendered without a fight in a matter of hours.
It is a tale of two armies, one poorly equipped but highly motivated ideologically, and the other nominally well-equipped, but dependent on Nato support, poorly led and riddled with corruption.

When the history of the first decades of this century comes to be written, there will be few more telling artworks than Ben Grosser‚Äôs film Order of Magnitude. In the 47 minute video, Grosser, a digital artist and professor of new media at the University of Illinois, has spliced together every public instance in which Mark Zuckerberg has talked of ‚Äúmore‚Äù and ‚Äúbigger‚Äù. The resulting montage of interviews and presentations is a fast forward of the rapid growth of Facebook as, in the chief executive‚Äôs mouth, thousands become millions then billions. It makes a mesmerising monologue, the story of our times.
‚ÄúThe idea that Zuckerberg latched on to even more than anyone else in Silicon Valley,‚Äù Grosser suggested, when he spoke to me from Urbana via Zoom last week, ‚Äúwas the need to grow as big as fast as possible, get the largest market share. And everything was subservient to that.‚Äù The film is part of a double act. Grosser has also spliced together all the moments he can find of Zuckerberg ever mentioning numbers diminishing or things getting smaller. This film runs for 30 seconds, though in a new version for his forthcoming exhibition at the Arebyte Gallery in London, he has slowed those seconds down so it also runs for 47 minutes.

The singer-songwriter continues to impress on a second album that beguiles equally in its rockier and softer moments
‚ÄúSwear I‚Äôve got a sign written on my back,‚Äù storms Jade Bird on Candidate, a raw-edged rock bruiser about being a dickhead-magnet. With her second album, the English singer (who attended the Brit School and is now based in the US) is concerned with confounding first impressions made by 2019‚Äôs Jade Bird, an arresting debut of Americana-tinged pop rock driven by remarkable songcraft and that sweetly serrated force-10 voice.
And yet for all the avowed influences here ‚Äì Blur! Oasis! the Bee Gees! Iggy Pop! PJ Harvey! ‚Äì it‚Äôs to her credit that it still sounds very much like Jade Bird, though notably rockier. There‚Äôs a heaviness of guitar and intent that suits her well, from the dirty, chunky riffs and raw howl of Open Up the Heavens to the Sladey stomp of Honeymoon. Her softer shades are just as beguiling: Punchline leans in to the expansive class of Nashville‚Äôs session musicians (the album was recorded at the storied RCA studios), a rich country-rock short story flashing images such as ‚Äúa wedding band, thrown out the window of a black sedan‚Äù, while Red White and Blue is a delicately killer acoustic ballad.

Bach and Mozart on a modern grand seemed bizarrely anachronistic, although two encores showcased the Icelandic pianist V√≠kingur √ìlafsson at his best
The Philharmonia‚Äôs Prom should have been the first to be conducted by its newly installed principal conductor, Santtu-Matias Rouvali. In the event Rouvali could not travel to London, and his place was taken by Paavo J√§rvi, who also took over the programme unchanged, and with it the much-anticipated appearance of another Proms debutant, the Icelandic pianist V√≠kingur √ìlafsson, in concertos by Bach and Mozart.
It was √ìlafsson‚Äôs crisp, clean solo disc of Bach that first brought him international acclaim, as well as a fistful of recording awards, three years ago, and there were certainly flashes of the musicality, immaculate technique and limpid tone that won him so many admirers in this performance of the F minor Keyboard Concerto BWV 1056. Yet, played on a modern concert grand with J√§rvi and the strings of a symphony orchestra chugging along in its wake, it all seemed bizarrely anachronistic, as if conjuring up the spirits of Myra Hess and Henry Wood and the Proms of the 1930s.

France‚Äôs pass sanitaire health permit system will be extended to more than 120 major department stores and shopping centres on Monday in areas where levels of Covid infection are causing concern, including Paris and the Mediterranean coast.
The decision to extend the measure restricting entry to customers who can prove they have been vaccinated, have had a negative Covid test or have recovered from coronavirus was made by local officials.

The Spanish government has launched an inquiry after it emerged that a power company drained two reservoirs during a heatwave and drought in order to profit from exceptionally high electricity prices.
Iberdrola, the country‚Äôs second biggest producer, drained the dams in Zamora and C√°ceres provinces in western Spain over a period of a few weeks to produce cheap hydroelectricity while the price to consumers is at a record high.

James Cochran has never been happier. A wildly inventive and ambitious cook, he trained for almost a decadeunder the chef Brett Graham, first at the Ledbury and then the Michelin-starred Harwood Arms. In 2018, on his first appearance, he won the ultimate prize on the BBC‚Äôs Great British Menu: the champion of champions. And experience, he thinks, has taught him restraint at his Islington restaurant 12:51. ‚ÄúI used to have 23 dishes on the menu, and it was intense,‚Äù says Cochran. ‚ÄúCovid maybe opened my eyes and made me think, ‚ÄòI put myself under so much pressure‚Äô. Now it‚Äôs just a dream.‚Äù
There‚Äôs good news for the rest of us, too: Cochran has supplied five summer recipes for OFM. Raised in Whitstable, Kent, by a mum from St Vincent and a Scottish dad, he wanted to pick dishes that nodded to his background. But mainly he chose food that would be fun to eat outdoors on a sunny day. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been cooped up for so long,‚Äù says Cochran. ‚ÄúAnd I just think they‚Äôre great elements that can be taken to the beach, or to the park, or in your back gardenanywhere now we can have friends round. With my style of food, it‚Äôs important it packs a lot of flavour and you can look across the board and there‚Äôs a lot of punchy flavours going on. there.‚Äù

                    <span>Looking to the new term as a life-changing boundary feels reassuring
There is still a month on the clock until state schools go back in New York, but for plenty of kids in other states in the US ‚Äì Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee among them ‚Äì the autumn term started last week. Many school districts in those states have put mask mandates in place, as has New York: in September, when 1 million-plus children in the city go back to school, they will all be required to wear masks. Meanwhile, remote-schooling options in the city have been cancelled for all but immunocompromised children, and the head of the country‚Äôs second-biggest teaching union is pushing for mandatory vaccination for teachers. Changes in infection rates notwithstanding, the start of the new school year looks as if it might be as normal as we can hope it to be.
The strange thing about this anticipation is that it falls at a time when many of us are, once again, curtailing our movements because of Covid. For the first time in months, there are two new Covid cases in my apartment building; infection rates in the city and across the US as a whole are up. After what seemed like a spell of premature optimism at the start of summer, everyone has returned to full-on mask-wearing in stores, and often in the street. And whereas prior to vaccination it was easy to tell oneself that children were less at risk than adults, now it‚Äôs one‚Äôs unvaccinated kids who seem most starkly unprotected. The risks are still very low ‚Äì according to the American Academy of Paediatrics, only between 0.1% and 1.9% of all Covid cases in children in the US result in hospitalisation. Still, it changes things knowing that, as a vaccinated adult, if you decide to travel or go to an indoor party it‚Äôs your kids who may suffer the consequences.

This autumn she also plays one of the leads in the eagerly awaited reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise.

Berlin-based Agora Energiewende said the country‚Äôs emissions would probably rise by the equivalent of 47m tons of carbon dioxide.

Few dates in economic history classify as turning points but one of them was 15 August 1971 when Richard Nixon went on TV to announce that the US would no longer exchange dollars held by foreign governments for gold.
Nixon‚Äôs announcement 50 years ago this week had lasting ramifications. It was a statement to the world that the US was too weak to continue anchoring the global monetary system as it had done for the past quarter of a century. It would remain the world‚Äôs biggest and most important economy, but the days when it was uniquely dominant were at an end.

Hambling responds to this small calamity in the way I imagine she has responded to much larger calamities in the past: she takes a slurp of wine, instinctively reaches for her cigarette packet, and laughs wheezily and long.

When I was growing up in a small Scottish town, we had a bookshop that was utterly terrifying. The books were housed on high shelves behind counters staffed by intimidating assistants. If you didn‚Äôt go in knowing what you wanted, tough. There was no possibility of browsing. If I got a book token for my birthday or a school prize, I‚Äôd always pick a title I hadn‚Äôt read yet from a favourite author so I knew what to ask for. Chances were, they didn‚Äôt have it and it would have to be ordered. Cue pursed lips and a frown.
Honestly, it‚Äôs a miracle that I ever managed to amass a book collection at all.

                    <span>Clare Smyth has three Michelin stars, and cooked for Harry and Meghan‚Äôs wedding. Her mission? To make the humble magical
When Clare Smyth first looked round the premises of her restaurant, Core, she had a strong feeling that ‚Äúthe place was full of good times‚Äù. Though she did not know the history of the building, that instinct was spot on. Back in 1969 another pioneering woman, Prue Leith, had made her name at 92 Kensington Park Road, in the same knocked-through ground floor of a pair of grand stucco-fronted Victorian terraced houses. When Leith‚Äôs had opened, Humphrey Lyttelton, then restaurant critic of Tatler, urged diners to make their way to an unfamiliar part of the capital by any means possible: ‚ÄúIf you can rob a bank, or beg or borrow a fortune, go to the seamy end of Notting Hill‚Ä¶‚Äù For 25 years, many followed his advice, including several Beatles and Princess Margaret.
Half a century on, this end of Notting Hill is very far from ‚Äúseamy‚Äù. What was 1960s Portobello bohemia for Leith has become grown-up and gentrified ‚Äì but you still would be advised to consider grand larceny in order to get a table at Core. When I visited the restaurant earlier in the summer, it was the opening week after lockdown ‚Äì which meant it was also the first week that Smyth, 42, had been able to celebrate with her diners the fact that she had become the only British woman ever to be awarded three Michelin stars for her cooking. Good times, indeed.

The US is in a race against time to ramp up the processing of its former Afghan employees under threat from the Taliban military juggernaut, but critics say the effort is too little and too late for Afghans who responded to western urging to build a more democratic society.
As of Friday, about 1,200 Afghans with special immigration visas (SIVs) had arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, as part of the evacuation plan Operation Allies Refuge. The group ‚Äì comprising former military interpreters, other US employees and their families ‚Äì is a tiny fraction of the 18,000 Afghans known to have applied for SIVs for themselves and their families, who are desperate to leave as the Taliban close in on Kabul.

                    <span>The education secretary has done his best, which isn‚Äôt exactly saying much
Watching Gavin Williamson‚Äôs media interviews last week, I was suddenly reminded of the 1980s TV show In at the Deep End. Do you remember it? Each week, a likable, self-effacing beta male, merrily projecting an aura of general uselessness, would be thrust into circumstances for which he was unqualified and unsuitable. He‚Äôd get a small amount of expert advice but, by the end of the programme, he‚Äôd be expected to wing it as, say, a rally driver, snooker player, opera singer, hairdresser or chef. Often, you‚Äôd think: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coping pretty well for someone so clueless!‚Äù
That‚Äôs exactly what I feel about Williamson. He has an engaging manner that might engender confidence under different circumstances ‚Äì if, for example, he were proposing to valet park your car. ‚ÄúHe probably won‚Äôt steal it or crash it,‚Äù you‚Äôd think. And even as education secretary it seems likely he‚Äôs benefited from up to an afternoon‚Äôs intensive instruction. Then I reckon someone‚Äôs given him a useful side of A4 with the main points. To say ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about being education secretary‚Äù would be grossly unfair. It‚Äôs possible he knows the first 12 things.

                    <span>As an awkward teen, comedian Phil Wang found making people laugh a superpower. He talks about his British Malaysian upbringing, his one-sided ‚Äòbeef‚Äô with Tom Hiddleston, and why we need to tackle race in standup
Phil Wang is trying to think of a comedian who isn‚Äôt an introvert. When he‚Äôs really pondering a subject hard his eyes typically roll upwards, his pupils almost disappearing into his eyelids, like he had written the answer to the riddle on the ceiling above him earlier. Eventually he alights upon one candidate, but doesn‚Äôt want to name him in case the comedian would take offence at being called an extrovert.
‚ÄúGosh, maybe I can‚Äôt think of any,‚Äù says the 31-year-old Wang, finally. ‚ÄúProbably I don‚Äôt even know what an extrovert is any more. I don‚Äôt think extroverts really need comedy, in a way. They don‚Äôt need a formalised setup in order to interact with people. That was the main appeal about standup, now I think about it, for me as an awkward teenager: it was a formalised setup for interacting. People had to listen to me. And if they interrupted me, they were being rude. And they should leave.‚Äù

The British national accused of selling secrets to Russia will not be extradited back home to face justice despite the seriousness of the claims.
Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù counter-espionage laws have been exposed, say sources, by the arrest of David Smith, 57, a security guard contracted to the Berlin embassy. They say there is little point in bringing him home because the current legislation is too weak to deal with spies acting against British interests.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

A Tory donor and his son are facing questions about two private companies they run offering Covid-19 PCR tests for travellers, amid complaints about poor service.
Dr Ashraf Chohan, founder and chair of Conservative Friends of the NHS, which aims to forge ties between politicians and healthcare workers in the private and public sectors, is the sole director of 1Rapid Clinics, a government-approved Covid-19 testing company that some customers have claimed sent results back late, lost samples and refused refunds.

BBC news executives vowed on Saturday night to continue to report from Russia and China despite growing fears that both countries are becoming increasingly difficult to cover.
After a surprise Russian move last week that will force correspondent Sarah Rainsford permanently out of Moscow at the end of the month, a senior figure in BBC news said that Russia‚Äôs decision not to renew her visa marks a new low in relations. ‚ÄúEfforts are being made to keep communications open but the feeling is that Sarah is sadly right when she says she doesn‚Äôt see Russia changing its mind,‚Äù he said.

A million workers are still employed by businesses at risk of closure over the next three months, as the government is poised to withdraw critical Covid support schemes, according to new analysis.
One in 16 firms say that they are now at risk of closure in the next quarter, the study by the LSE‚Äôs Programme on Innovation and Diffusion (POID) has found. While it marks a major rise in confidence since the worst depths of the pandemic in January, there are warnings that the risk to so many workers coincides with the planned end of the furlough jobs scheme and a cut to universal credit by ¬£20 a week.

Back in April, Rapaport tweeted screenshots of a private Instagram exchange with the Brooklyn Nets swingman that came after Rapaport criticised one of Durant‚Äôs post-game interviews.

Femicide ‚Äì the killing of women and girls by men ‚Äì is once again hidden in plain sight by the government. A new Violence Against Women and Girls strategy announced last month fails to address the worst form of men‚Äôs violence against women and girls: their killing. The same omission was made in the two previous strategies. Our End Femicide campaign‚Äôs first objective is to ‚Äúname it‚Äù. Six months in to the campaign, our government has failed women and girls at the first hurdle. 
The murder of women in the UK has recently generated hundreds of articles and a mass outpouring of grief and anger. So how come the government has failed to name and identify femicide? If not now, when? What will it take?

Seasoned figures in the toy industry have told the Observer that consumers will face higher prices and greater scarcity on the shelves this Christmas as a result of a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of economic pressures that have disrupted their plans.

The problem with dishonesty is that you have to remember your most recent falsehoods to at least try to keep your story straight. In their pantomime ‚Äúwar against woke‚Äù, the UK‚Äôs statue defenders are incapable of remembering what they said just 12 months ago.
Last summer, when the statue of Edward Colston was toppled, those who howled in protest claimed that they were not seeking to defend the reputation of a slave trader ‚Äì a man complicit in the deaths of 19,000 Africans ‚Äì but were merely opposed to the destructive way in which the statue had been removed. Toppling statues, or even removing them from public display peacefully, they lectured, entailed ‚Äúerasing history‚Äù.

Much of Dan Guthrie‚Äôs life has been haunted by a disturbing mechanised figure resembling a tethered black slave boy, which is supposed to strike a bell hourly in the centre of Stroud.

‚ÄúMy eyes lock on to the Blackboy clock every time I turn the corner on to Castle Street,‚Äù he explains from his home in Stroud. ‚ÄúThe boy has huge red lips and is wearing a golden leaf skirt ‚Äì and he is weirdly enslaved to the clock mechanism when it‚Äôs working. It is an offensive racist relic from the transatlantic slave trade, and the fact that it is still up in Stroud is a mystery to me.‚Äù

What‚Äôs in your wallet? Do you even know where it is? In March last year I stuck a bank card in my pocket; since then, I‚Äôve pretty much given up on the card, too. For the purposes of this exercise, I found and checked my wallet: there‚Äôs a ¬£5 note I accidentally ripped in half years ago, folded up very small, plus 38p. ‚ÄúThe ¬£20 I‚Äôve had since I was sent home from work on 27 March 2020,‚Äù says one friend, fairly typically. ‚ÄúThe same ¬£10 I‚Äôve had in my purse for over a year.‚Äù ‚Äú¬£10.70 ‚Äì the last of the ¬£50 I took out at the beginning of first lockdown.‚Äù
And when did you last use cash? For me, it was a cucumber plant (¬£1) two months ago. The plant guy is one of the few hold-outs among the off-grid types at the local ‚Äúfood circle‚Äù market ‚Äì every kale-selling hippy has a sleek contactless terminal. We keep coins for supermarket trolleys, occasional parking, and some window cleaners are wedded to cash. These and tipping ‚Äì many of us don‚Äôt trust big companies to distribute digital tips fairly, with some justification ‚Äì are the few remaining pockets of semi- consistent cash use among my friends and acquaintances.

If you‚Äôre sitting in a safe and comfortable position, close your eyes and try to feel your heart beating in your chest. Can you, without moving your hands to take your pulse, feel each movement and count its rhythm? Or do you struggle to detect anything at all? This simple test is just one way to assess your ‚Äúinteroception‚Äù ‚Äì your brain‚Äôs perception of your body‚Äôs state, transmitted from receptors on all your internal organs.
Interoception may be less well known than the ‚Äúoutward facing‚Äù senses such as sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, but it has enormous consequences for your wellbeing. Scientists have shown that our sensitivity to interoceptive signals can determine our capacity to regulate our emotions, and our subsequent susceptibility to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.

The hours after a fatal attack on members of the public are harrowing. Confusion reigns, rumours swirl and anxious people try to contact loved ones to make sure they are safe.

When Devon and Cornwall police announced it was not terrorism-related, I wondered how they could be so sure ‚Äì and their judgment has been called into question by everything that has emerged since.

                    <span>Three months on from the devastating conflict, little has been rebuilt of the bombed high-rises that were homes and offices
Four years ago, Jehad Judah was pleased to be able to afford to buy his family a flat in al-Jalaa, a 14-storey building in downtown Gaza City. The upscale tower block was home to about 700 people as well as lawyers, computer software businesses and journalism bureaus belonging to the Associated Press of the US and Qatar‚Äôs Al Jazeera.
The 54-year-old bespectacled civil servant spent the first 30 years of his life living in the jumble of breeze-block housing of a nearby refugee camp. After he met his wife in 2001, the couple moved to Gaza to start a family. The Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the strip which came along a few years later made life in the city hard, but al-Jalaa still offered a decent standard of living, he said.

A major civil society group that was behind some of Hong Kong‚Äôs biggest protests has disbanded under increasing pressure from police.
The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) announced its closure on Sunday, saying no members were willing to perform secretariat duties after its convenor, Figo Chan Ho-wun, was jailed for 18 months over a 2019 rally.

                    <span>The Dutch photographer‚Äôs ‚Äãself portrait, from a series documenting every stage of his journey, ‚Äãfinds him ‚Äãreturning to a source of childhood happiness
When he was a child, Marvel Harris had always felt joyful in the rain, but in his teenage years he‚Äôd forgotten that feeling. In adolescence, Marvel, who is autistic, experienced depression and gender dysphoria which provoked eating disorders and self-harm. In 2017, he embarked on gender transition and documented every stage of that process in a series of self-portraits, which are painful to witness and profoundly affecting. This picture was taken outside Marvel‚Äôs parents‚Äô house in the town of Zutphen in the east of the Netherlands. He was recovering from gender affirmation surgery and elated by the fact that he could once again feel the inner childhood joy of a rainstorm.
Marvel, now 25, started taking his self-portraits, he says, because he found it ‚Äúreally difficult to express what was going on in my mind‚Äù. At first, the photographs helped him to speak about his feelings with his family. Later, when he shared the pictures with therapists and friends, they encouraged him to put them online, to help others who might recognise themselves in his images. His camera provided an unflinching closeup of his traumas, as well as a tender account of the support he received from those close to him. Marvel, a book of his pictures, is the winner of this year‚Äôs Mack first book award.

Editors don‚Äôt send their journalists to cover wars because they like misery and carnage. They do so because the readers need to know about the carnage.

Report: last major Afghan city in the north falls to the Taliban 

 2.06am BST 
The UN‚Äôs refugee agency provided this update on Friday. What is particularly worrying about Kabul at the moment is that it is where so many people (120,000 from rural areas) fled to seeking safety in recent months: 
Some 80% of nearly a quarter of a million Afghans forced to flee since the end of May are women and children.
Nearly 400,000 were forced from their homes since the beginning of the year, joining 2.9 million Afghans already internally displaced across the country at the end of 2020.
 2.01am BST 
The sun will begin rising shortly over Kabul (which has been blacked out for the last few hours) and we should start to get a clearer picture of where things stand.

Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates

Ministers are being pressed to reveal what contingency plans are in place to deal with a future Covid variant that evades current vaccines, amid warnings from scientific advisers that such an outcome could set the battle against the pandemic back a year or more.
Recent papers produced by the government‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have suggested that the arrival of a variant that evades vaccines is a ‚Äúrealistic possibility‚Äù. Sage backed continued work on new vaccines that reduce infection and transmission more than current jabs, the creation of more vaccine-production facilities in the UK and lab-based studies to predict evolution of variants.

At least 304 people have died and hundreds are missing after Haiti was struck by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that reduced churches, hotels and homes to rubble, in the latest tragedy to hit a Caribbean nation already mired in profound humanitarian and political crises and still reeling from the recent assassination of its president.
The earthquake on Saturday, which struck the country‚Äôs south-west at 8.29am local time, was felt across the Caribbean and rekindled painful memories of the devastating 2010 quake that killed more than 200,000 people. The prime minister, Ariel Henry, has declared a month-long state of emergency.

                    <span>Manchester City manager backed his club‚Äôs transfer record on eve of Tottenham game overshadowed by Harry Kane talk
Pep Guardiola is the big spender whose greatest triumphs came on the cheap, even if it may not make him the poster boy for penury. As he cited his cut-price Champions League wins, the impression he gave is that he sees them as part of football‚Äôs rich tapestry. Guardiola is set to become the first manager to field a ¬£100m footballer in the Premier League ‚Äì and if he has his way then Jack Grealish will only possess the status as the division‚Äôs record signing for a few weeks.
If Sunday‚Äôs game at Tottenham doubles up as a tug of war for Harry Kane‚Äôs services, money may form a familiar backdrop. Guardiola can be an alchemist of a coach and an inventive tactician, but he is familiar with the accusation he has become a chequebook manager. English football‚Äôs maiden nine-figure buy may be used in the case for the prosecution. Tottenham offered ¬£25m for Grealish in 2018; perhaps Daniel Levy‚Äôs reluctance to go higher amounted to a false economy as, three years later, Manchester City paid four times as much for the Aston Villa captain.

It is early on Friday morning, Steve Bruce has just been asked about hope and he looks braced for combat.
Can Newcastle‚Äôs manager offer the disenchanted and disengaged any reason for optimism? Does he expect to be greeted by rows of empty seats when Newcastle kick off against West Ham at St James‚Äô Park on Sunday afternoon? Is he aware that a majority of the fans seem unusually pessimistic about this season‚Äôs prospects? Bruce‚Äôs body language tenses.

                    <span>Author of government study says Treasury resistance to green spending programmes could halt progress to net zero 
Imposing ‚Äúpremature austerity‚Äù again will undermine the fight against climate change and stop poorer households going green, one of the world‚Äôs leading climate economists has warned the government, amid claims that the Treasury is resisting policies to tackle the crisis.
Nicholas Stern, the author of the seminal 2006 government study into the costs of climate change, said comprehensive programmes were needed to help poorer households make the switch to electric cars and away from gas heating, if the government hoped to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

At the outset this had the hallmarks of a banana skin but they showed little sign of slipping up against foes clad in yellow. Instead they enjoyed as comfortable an opening assignment as they could have wanted and the upsides did not end there.
It bodes nicely that, for the fifth consecutive year, Mohamed Salah wasted no time in getting off the mark. He also recorded two assists, even if one of them owed mainly to good fortune, but the vicious finish that beat Tim Krul all ends up to guarantee the outcome was ample evidence he is in fine nick. He and Liverpool could have scored more but there was pleasure to be taken at both ends of the pitch.

Captain‚Äôs unbeaten century gives hosts slim lead

For the second successive Saturday and the fifth time this year Joe Root delivered a precious century for England, batting through three intoxicating sessions of Test cricket that both underlined his golden form and, more broadly, why the longest format continues to capture the imagination.
As he walked off at the close, his whites scarcely betraying the toil of nearly nine hours at the crease, Root was 180 not out from 321 balls and receiving handshakes and back slaps from his opponents. The final wicket had just fallen at the other end, Jimmy Anderson bowled by Mohammed Shami, but England had put 391 on the board in response to India‚Äôs first innings 364 and a slender lead of 27 had been secured.

                    <span>A grisly feast of scary British films is heading our way. Why now? Once seen as ‚Äòvideo nasties‚Äô, many believe they have a positive role to play in a pandemic
The terror begins in the London of 1985 when Enid Baines, a film censor, spots an eerie reflection of her sister‚Äôs mysterious disappearance in some frightening footage she must view. Enid, the traumatised character at the centre of the chilling new film Censor, has to unravel the dark riddle as a public row about the impact of hardcore horror is raging.
Censor is just one film among a carmine flood of modern British horror now hitting screens and streaming services. Out in cinemas on 20 August, it has been described as a gory tribute to the ‚Äúvideo nasties of the past‚Äù. But the film‚Äôs Welsh director, Prano Bailey Bond, is also making a timely comment on the strange therapeutic relationship between horror films and their ever-growing audience.

                    <span>The former Channel 4 News broadcaster on writing at 4am, reading Carlo Rovelli and the danger posed by the new wave of fascism that‚Äôs on the rise across the world
Paul Mason was born in Lancashire in 1960, the son of a headmistress and a lorry driver. He started his career as a music teacher before becoming a journalist in the early 90s. He joined BBC‚Äôs Newsnight as a business editor in 2001 and he later worked for Channel 4 News, jobs that took him to China, Gaza and across Bolivia. In 2016, Mason quit broadcasting to pursue writing full time. His latest book, How to Stop Fascism, draws from his own anti-fascist activism in the 1970s and 80s and explores how a new wave of fascism in the 21st century can be prevented from rising.
What prompted you to write the book at this particular moment?
In September 2019, I was on a peaceful pro-remain rally in Whitehall that got surrounded by quite violent Brexit supporters, who turned out to be Tommy Robinson fans. They were shouting: ‚ÄúPaul Mason, you‚Äôre a Marxist‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a traitor to our country.‚Äù Ten years ago, such people would have been talking about migrants taking our jobs, and now they‚Äôre worried about Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. I realised something had changed: rightwing populism has been given intellectual coherence by the thought architecture of fascism. As someone who‚Äôs been involved in anti-fascism on and off for four decades, it made me think, I need to go back and relearn what fascism is.

                    <span>New world winemakers have long revered French grapes ‚Äì but now southern European varieties are making their mark
Whether it‚Äôs the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise taking its Canute-like stance against the waves of English words flowing into the French language, or chefs despairing at the prevalence of the ‚ÄúMcDo‚Äù and the gastronomic mutant that is the French taco, there‚Äôs a widespread tendency in France to cast the French as minnows in the fight against globalisation.
The idea is that this is an essentially Anglo-American process, something which is done to, rather than by, the French, and that must be resisted at all costs. All of which is enough to raise a decidedly Gallic shrug among winemakers everywhere else in the world. When it comes to the modern history of wine, the French are very much the imperialists.

For Rafael Ben√≠tez, the first day in a potentially troublesome office unfolded perfectly as spirit, quality and tactical acumen combined to produce a stirring comeback against Southampton.

To be honest, it felt a bit unnecessary from Chelsea‚Äôs manager. After all, consider the context: the sun was shining on a packed Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were a goal to the good and it was already clear they were far too strong for a mediocre Crystal Palace.

                    <span>No salt and pepper, no spices, not enough loo roll ‚Äì welcome to your holiday cottage
‚ÄúWelcome basket‚Äù. It sounds so nice, doesn‚Äôt it? So ‚Ä¶ welcoming. Driving up the M1 to the holiday cottage you booked online, you picture the delights that await you, and smile inwardly even as the sign ahead says: ‚ÄúQueue after the next junction.‚Äù You know already there‚Äôll be a lemon drizzle cake from ‚Äúour local farm shop‚Äù (ie a factory in Derby). Also, a jar of marmalade, a bottle of apple juice and a loaf of bread. There always is. But everything else ‚Äì ginger snaps? Black pudding? A Peking duck? ‚Äì is still, at this point, subject to the kind of moderately wild imagining that has you pushing your foot down just a little harder on the accelerator.
What you‚Äôre forgetting, of course, is that welcome baskets are not, in fact, even remotely welcoming. They are passive-aggressive acts, timed to remind you of both your own desperation (‚ÄúHow much did we pay for this, again?‚Äù) and of the fact that a ‚Äúself-catering holiday‚Äù is basically a contradiction in terms (true in any year, but never more brutally so than in 2021). The first rule of the welcome basket ‚Äì congratulations, you‚Äôve arrived! ‚Äì is that it will not be a basket at all, but a cardboard box or a plastic bag. The second rule is that, though the house is for four people, it will invariably contain only two, or six, of everything: two yoghurts, two scones, six sausages. (You do the maths, as they say.) The welcome basket‚Äôs essential message is: please don‚Äôt imagine for a minute that you‚Äôre going to be able to get away without visiting Tesco tomorrow.

Some are truly ingenious,‚Äù he says, singling out the hairy-stemmed electric shock plant, ‚Äúan innocent-looking seed pod until an animal (or human) decides to bite!‚Äù

The Hidden Beauty of Seeds and Fruits: The Botanical Photography of Levon Biss is at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, until 26 September.

Manchester United led the way, parading Rapha√´l Varane on the pitch before kick-off, using a quadruple Champions League winner and a 2018 world champion as proof of their largesse. Leeds produced an idiosyncratic response. Enter Marcelo Bielsa, soon to perch on a new bucket.
Unlike the other United, Bielsa has never been a slave to the transfer market. He believes improvement comes from within, aided by relentless running. Luke Ayling has symbolised it. He was a right-back in the lower half of the Championship when Bielsa inherited him and a scorer of a spectacular goal at Old Trafford on Saturday. When Leeds were briefly level, it served as an endorsement of their manager‚Äôs credo.

                    <span>Bright hues abound in the stunning Udine hideaway of the Italian designer.
An Italian oasis to call home is on a lot of people‚Äôs wishlists. Few, however, would think to look for it in Udine, the northeastern city in the lesser-known Friuli-Venezia Giulia region ‚Äì unless you‚Äôre Patrizia Moroso, that is.
Despite the Italian design scene revolving around the Lombardy capital of Milano, it was here, 20km from the Slovenian border, that the Italian furniture designer discovered the hideaway she was to make her home 15 years ago. Although she has had a long history with the city by virtue of it being where her parents founded their design company, Moroso, in the 1950s and where she has worked as art director since the 1990s, she discovered her sanctuary quite by chance. ‚ÄúI was pregnant with my third child and my two eldest were crazy, terrible boys! I needed a house with a garden so they could live outside,‚Äù recalls Moroso, who was living in an apartment not far away in the historical centre with her husband, the artist Abdou Salam Gaye, and growing brood. ‚ÄúOne day, I was out walking with a friend and I looked over a fence and saw a kind of wild paradise full of plants and trees. I tried to find the owner to see if they would sell the place.‚Äù

I was born in food. My dad used to say: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have much money and we don‚Äôt have fancy cars, but we always have good food in the fridge and on the table.‚Äù My parents would buy fillet steaks, foie gras, oysters, lobster; they love good quality food. Every day we had a three-course meal: starter, main and dessert and cheese before dessert. Every single day.
My parents were nurses in a hospital in Limoges and they talked a lot about work at the dinner table: about patient care and the service that was provided to the patient and how they were making the customer, the patient, feel. And, for me, this informed the way I work in restaurants [as a ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel]. It was about organisation, it was about trust, it was aboutefficiency, it was about timing, it was about attention to detail. And it was about quality. I was cradled in it; I was almost brainwashed in a particular way of doing things.

Once upon a time, updates of computer operating systems were of interest only to geeks. No longer ‚Äì at least in relation to Apple‚Äôs operating systems, iOS and Mac OS. You may recall how Version 14.5 of iOS, which required users to opt in to tracking, had the online advertising racketeers in a tizzy while their stout ally, Facebook, stood up for them. Now, the forthcoming version of iOS has libertarians, privacy campaigners and ‚Äúthin-end-of-the-wedge‚Äù worriers in a spin.
It also has busy mainstream journalists struggling to find headline-friendly summaries of what Apple has in store for us. ‚ÄúApple is prying into iPhones to find sexual predators, but privacy activists worry governments could weaponise the feature‚Äù was how the venerable Washington Post initially reported it. This was, to put it politely, a trifle misleading and the first three paragraphs below the headline were, as John Gruber brusquely pointed out, plain wrong.

                    <span>(Colemine/Alligator)
This unusual US trio of two guitars and drums keep things fierce and simple on their homage to the great Chicago bluesman Hound Dog Taylor
When the young Bruce Iglauer witnessed a performance by Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers in 1971, he created a record label so he could sign them. Iglauer was a 23-year-old blues fanatic and Taylor an unrecorded 54-year-old veteran of the Chicago blues scene, though his music reached back further, to the first stirrings of postwar electrified blues. Half a century on, Iglauer‚Äôs Alligator imprint is the world‚Äôs premier blues label, while Taylor, who died in 1975, is commemorated by this appealingly unvarnished tribute.
Named after a vintage Gibson amplifier, GA-20 are a trio dedicated to the raucous joys of early Chicago blues, the music of Muddy Waters, Howlin‚Äô Wolf and, their favourite, Hound Dog Taylor. They are unapologetic equipment buffs, using only antique instruments, and if you care to know how a rowdy 1950s Chicago jook joint sounded, GA-20 are here to help. With an unusual bass-free lineup of two guitars and drums, they keep things simple and fierce; scything, growling riffs, driving grooves and defiant vocals. Itchy, blistering boogies such as She‚Äôs Gone and Let‚Äôs Get Funky epitomise their visceral approach, amid a smattering of slower outings. Antique maybe, but a reminder that the blues retain their odd, primal power.

                    <span>The fuels we use to warm our homes create a carbon burden. Systems that capture ambient heat could offer a solution
One of the greatest contributors to pollution is such a part of everyday life it is easily overlooked: the fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK‚Äôs carbon emissions.
This is why the government plans to ban gas boilers in new-build homes from 2025, a policy which could extend to all new gas boilers in homes from the mid-2030s. Beyond this date, newly installed heating systems would need to be low-carbon or able to be converted to use clean-burning fuel such as hydrogen.

Despite investigating Iraq‚Äôs secret arms programme in the back yard of Saddam Hussein, the Observer journalist knew that the following day he would be gone, back to the safety of London.
Farzad never made it to the UK. The picture chronicles his last night of freedom. Within 24 hours he would be imprisoned in solitary confinement. Then he would be starved and beaten, the start of a chain of events that would culminate, amid international furore, with his execution at the behest of Saddam.

The Garden Museum in London is running an architectural competition for the design of a pavilion for St Mary‚Äôs Gardens, a leafy enclave next to its premises in a converted church in Lambeth, south London. I am a member of the interview panel. The winner has yet to be chosen, but I can reveal that it won‚Äôt be a submission from one Minecraft builder that shows a blue-tinged skyscraper that occupies the entire footprint of the garden.
It comes with a justification based on the menace of ‚Äúvery bad‚Äù grey squirrels to Britain‚Äôs ecology: ‚ÄúHow do we stop grey squirrel[s]?‚Äù it asks. ‚ÄúSquirrels eat nuts. Nuts grow on trees‚Ä¶ if we remove the trees we stop the grey squirrels,‚Äù the submission explains. So ‚Äúto remove trees we build a big tower. It will also sell for a lot of money because it‚Äôs so big.‚Äù It ends with a sop to whoever might be troubled by the loss of green space: ‚ÄúIt can also have a garden on the roof.‚Äù It‚Äôs meant to be a joke and, as I say, it won‚Äôt win.

When I was two we swapped Birmingham ‚Äì where I was born ‚Äì for south London to build a better life. There was diversity and colour, music and parties; feral kids, barbecued chicken and the sound of reggae music. And then when I was 10 we moved to West Sussex.

                    <span>The record numbers who were awarded top A-level grades could find themselves living far from their chosen college
Top universities are scrambling to find enough accommodation for thousands of extra students, after record numbers netted the high grades they needed to clinch their offers last week. Some students are being offered halls in other cities or shared rooms, as institutions buy up spare private accommodation.
Students were celebrating on Tuesday as nearly 45% of A-level entries across the UK were awarded an A or A*, despite more than a year of disruption and school closures. But some of the most selective institutions are worried that with only weeks to go until students start arriving, they don‚Äôt have enough bedrooms, teaching space, staff or specialist equipment to cope with all their unplanned extra students.

When a griffon vulture last year graced the UK with its presence, awed birdwatchers from across the country gathered in the Derbyshire moors in the hope of catching a glance.
Now conservationists are hoping to make sightings of these magnificent birds more frequent by adding raw nature back into the countryside.

There was a hit song in the 1960s by the Lovin‚Äô Spoonful called Summer in the City all about how the days were hot and gritty, everyone looking half-dead, but the nights passionate and fun, full of sex and dancing. That was certainly my experience of the summer of 1967, an especially hot one when New York became a tropical city full of cruising and drinking, of people sleeping without air conditioners on the cindered roofs of their buildings, sharing wine coolers out of Mason jars, and attending late-night horror movies. In the Village on Sixth Avenue and West Third Street, there was always a pickup basketball game going, the beautiful shirtless bodies slathered in sweat.

Apricots rank pretty high up on my list of favourite stone fruits, and they score extra points when they‚Äôve had some time in the oven to soften and release all of that sweet, slightly sharp nectar. Here, I‚Äôve nestled them in a cake rather than a tart, because it can be a bit of a pain trying to keep pastry chilled in a hot summer kitchen. The camomile, subtle but present, brings such a soothing, floral vibe that just makes me want to hold on to summer for as long as possible.

Nazir Afzal, who was previously chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, said Jake Davison should have been on a police watchlist.

Imagine you are shrinking, becoming so small that the grass towers over you. Welcome to the territory ‚Ä¶ of mini-beasts! Wandering down my garden, I feel the summer sun on my face. I crouch down, watching universes under my feet. At normal size I observe a scuttling beetle, shining like a pool of ink. I see a centipede, its orange legs undulating. Then I go minuscule and see it in greater detail: colossal clacking pincers, armoured body, 80 legs. When I‚Äôm taller again, I can see new shoots of plants and, if I look down, a glistening earthworm poking out its head. In miniature, I journey inside an ant‚Äôs nest, marvel at its intricate halls and corridors, and wonder at the ants‚Äô teamwork.
I ride on the armoured back of a land crustacean ‚Äì normally woodlice would be tiny! Among the cr√®ches of young lice, amoebas form slimy strings, and mould creeps over the fallen leaves. Do you know how herbivorous millipedes are different from carnivorous centipedes, or how ants tolerate woodlice because they are nature‚Äôs cleaners? How springtails jump, how amoebas are slime moulds and slime moulds amoebas? How miniature mobs move as one? Respect the universe under our feet. It‚Äôs perfectly beautiful.
Nathanael, 10

                    <span>Living and working in the same space has given many couples an unwanted insight into each other‚Äôs dirtiest habits. But should we really find them so gross?

‚ÄúOver lockdown, the soundtrack to my life was email notifications pinging ‚Äì and people burping and farting,‚Äù says Emma, describing the unwavering ‚Äúbodily expulsions‚Äù from her husband and their three children as a constant ‚Äú21-gun salute‚Äù. Before the pandemic, her husband went to the office, her eldest child to school and her two younger ones to nursery, and she had the house to herself to work, think and breathe. Back then, the occasional bodily expulsion seemed comical: ‚ÄúWhen a kid does a burp at the table, especially if they‚Äôre not expecting it, it‚Äôs very funny.‚Äù But together 24/7, the humour was gone. ‚ÄúNot only was there no headspace, but I was having to put up with everyone just letting it fly. I was trapped in it, as if I was in a barn full of farting, belching animals. It started to make me feel a bit depressed. I thought, what has my life become?‚Äù
Emma was not the only one. During the third national lockdown, after the cancellation of Christmas lunches across the UK, Google searches for the following terms hit five-year peaks: ‚Äúbiting nails‚Äù, ‚Äúfarting‚Äù, ‚Äúburping‚Äù, and ‚Äúscratching‚Äù; June saw the peak of ‚Äúsnot‚Äù. We cannot know what provoked such searches to proliferate. But we can investigate what happened to couples when these formerly private explosions, explorations and excavations came out into the open and how different partners reacted. We can ask: what do these experiences teach us about relationships? About what it means to be human?

                    <span>Institutions offer to train staff and students as volunteers in joint operation with NHS 
Universities are setting up their own vaccination centres in an attempt to make campuses as safe as possible for the autumn term. And with millions of students arriving in September, some universities are already warning freshers that due to government restrictions on nightclubs in England they will not be able to attend big social events unless they are fully vaccinated.
The University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol and Kingston University in south London have already opened campus vaccination centres, and the University of Stirling in Scotland, where those visiting nightclubs must abide by contact-tracing rules, will open a centre to students and the public on Saturday. Other universities, including Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham and Portsmouth have confirmed they are in discussions about setting up vaccination services. These centres will be run and staffed by the NHS, but universities are offering to train up students or university staff to volunteer in them.

Bollywood star Kareena Kapoor has received abuse online from extremists over her new baby‚Äôs name.
Kapoor has been attacked on social media for calling her second son Jehangir, the imperial name of the 17th-century Mughal emperor, which means ‚Äúconqueror of the world‚Äù. Kapoor, a Hindu, and her husband, Saif Ali Khan, a Muslim and also a Bollywood star, have faced abuse for their marriage.

‚ÄòWorld turned upside down‚Äô as boy‚Äôs therapy dog stolen

Stalking parks in affluent areas and luring puppies out of gardens with treats are among the methods dog thieves are using, campaigners have said, amid suggestions the government is preparing to clamp down on pet abductions.
Criminals mug dog-walkers for their pets and raid boarding kennels in an effort to steal in-demand breeds, whose price tags have soared during the pandemic. They are also on the look out for pets that have not been neutered or spayed and are capable of breeding.

This row of brick sheds, locked away down overgrown country lanes in Bedfordshire, feels a long way from the glossy boardroom presentations about sustainable aviation. But it was recently the backdrop, in the search for greener flying, to a strange and remarkable scene.
‚ÄúAnyone passing would have wondered why these people were staring at a pipe and whooping and laughing,‚Äù says Bobby Sethi, associate professor of gas turbine combustion at Cranfield University. ‚ÄúBut we were almost certainly the only people in the world right then burning anything without producing CO2.‚Äù

Leanne was having her fringe cut when she was offered fertility drugs. It was leftover stock from her hairdresser‚Äôs treatment and she was giving it to Leanne for free on condition that she dispose of the packaging, as it was labelled with the hairdresser‚Äôs name and address. Leanne accepted the drugs ‚Äì it would save months on NHS waiting lists.
A couple of weeks later, Leanne began taking the hormones that would stimulate her ovaries. There was no doctor overseeing the process, no scan or blood test, so Leanne had no idea whether her body was responding correctly. Instead of medical supervision, she followed the advice of several women in a fertility forum. When the pills gave her vertigo, it was these strangers who advised that she should take them at night ‚Äúso you sleep through the worst of the side-effects‚Äù.

In the sprawling compound of Mullah Omar, the Taliban‚Äôs first emir, outside the southern city of Kandahar, curious onlookers were poking through his rooms.
There was the little mosque inside the walls, a camel stable damaged by a US rocket, and a series of bare rooms, some scattered with pages torn from a religious text, one a bedroom hung with a picture of an Alpine scene. Nearby, armed men sat on a strange sculpture of a mountain surrounded by spindly palm trees.

Ministers have launched a review of the misleading costs of Covid travel tests from ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù providers, as the government announced that the price of the NHS official test would fall by a fifth.
Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said UK holidaymakers would benefit from cheaper tests, as the NHS test and trace package for international arrivals will be reduced from ¬£88 to ¬£68 for green or fully vaccinated amber arrivals, and from ¬£170 to ¬£136 for two tests for amber arrivals who are not fully vaccinated.

The longer lockdown progresses, the more ovals and homes around Sydney resemble makeshift gyms. Some trainers have shifted everything but treadmills and ellipticals outside, while others rely on a few key items to train themselves and others while the gyms are closed.
So what do you need if your gym is shut and you want to keep training? Not much. And what you do need won‚Äôt break the bank.

Benny Zable has lived in Nimbin on and off since 1973, when he arrived in town for the Aquarius festival ‚Äì the event that seeded counterculture and escapist lifestyles into the northern rivers of New South Wales.
The 75-year-old artist and activist is a storied figure in this part of Australia, now a heartland for alternative health and wellness advocates, and notorious for low immunisation rates. He was also the first person from Nimbin to show up for a Covid-19 vaccine.

It looked like a rope or a question mark ‚Äì a black scribble on the sand. The creature had washed up on a Northland beach in May and was found by a steely local 11-year-old, who popped it into a bag, took it to his local corner shop and requested a box. The purveyor told him it was a sea snake, so the boy put it in a bucket and took it home. The snake did not survive the trip.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to do with it,‚Äù the boy told the New Zealand Herald. ‚ÄúI chopped its head off, put it in a bag and threw it out.‚Äù

The female cub, named Sparta, was found at the Semyuelyakh River in Russia‚Äôs Yakutia region in 2018 and a second lion cub called Boris was found the year before, according to a study published in the Quaternary journal.

The friendship of two female soldiers is the poignant basis of this intense, immersive audio play that takes you on a tour of the local area
When you watch news reports from war zones, you often see civilians going about their daily business even amid the gunfire. Conflicts take place not on designated battlefields, as they did in our school books, but on streets where people live.
With that in mind, it‚Äôs not too much of a stretch to imagine Edinburgh‚Äôs East Claremont Street, a residential road not far from the centre, as the frontline in some unknown battle. There are vantage points for snipers, alleyways for quick escapes and tenement flats where enemy combatants could be lurking.

A gunman who killed his mother and four passersby, including a three-year-old girl, had his firearms licence revoked in December, but police reinstated it last month after he attended an anger management course.
Police will face an investigation over their dealings with Jake Davison, 22, who expressed sympathy for the ‚Äúincel‚Äù movement and a keen interest in mass shootings. One resident from Plymouth, where the killing spree took place, said Davison‚Äôs family had sought treatment for his mental health issues.

Pollutants in smoke billowing from huge wildfires in the west of America have probably caused an increase in Covid-19 infections and deaths across several US states, new research has found.
Last year more than 10m acres of land were torched by wildfires, with five out of the six largest fires ever documented in California occurring within just a few months. The burning trees, shrubs and buildings gave off enormous plumes of smoke containing small particles of soot.

                    <span>People are losing their homes, their freedom and their hope. That should be more of a priority than US credibility
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be no circumstance where you‚Äôll see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan,‚Äù Joe Biden declared earlier this year, referencing the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war. The Taliban are not yet at the gates of Kabul. But two decades after the US toppled the Islamist militants, it is scrambling to evacuate its nationals, as are its allies. On Wednesday, US officials warned that Afghanistan‚Äôs government could fall in as little as 90 days. Since then the Taliban have seized Herat, Kandahar and Lashkar Gah; on Friday they took four more provincial capitals.
Such developments have a momentum of their own. The Taliban have captured more equipment as troops have surrendered, and as others turn tail, fewer see the point or hope in staying on and fighting. As resistance collapses, even the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is seeking to distance the UK from its great ally, describing the Trump-negotiated withdrawal agreement as a mistake and a ‚Äúrotten deal‚Äù which Britain tried to resist. Members of the wealthy Afghan political elite, many of whom prospered by plundering the country, have already departed or will do so with ease. But Afghans have been betrayed not only by their military and politicians, but by the long-term mistakes of the US and its allies and the abrupt and ill-planned rush for the exit.

                    <span>One of the world‚Äôs greatest sporting institutions lost sight of the principles on which its success was based
Ten years ago at Wembley, FC Barcelona won football‚Äôs Champions League with a performance that established an absolute hegemony in the world‚Äôs most popular sport. As Sir Alex Ferguson conceded, the Catalan team had given his Manchester United side ‚Äúa hiding‚Äù. But Barcelona‚Äôs hold on the global imagination has been about more than trophies and victories.
Arguably the most famous football club in the world, Barcelona is owned not by an oligarch but by its members, and run by a democratically elected president. For years, the team‚Äôs shirts bore the Unicef logo, rather than the name of a commercial sponsor. On the pitch in the early 2010s, the football reached a level of choral beauty never witnessed before, orchestrated by a trio of diminutive homegrown geniuses: Xavi, Andres Iniesta and, first among equals, Lionel Messi. Cups, ethics, rootedness and aesthetics: Barcelona had it all. ‚ÄúMore than a club‚Äù, as the well-known slogan has it.

New accounts created to get around social media suspensions

Twitter users banned after the torrent of racist abuse directed at England‚Äôs footballers are still posting on the platform, the Guardian has learned.
Fifty-six persistently abusive Twitter users had their accounts permanently suspended on 12 July, the day after the European Championship final, amid a blaze of publicity surrounding hateful messages directed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. Some of these users, or ‚Äòpersonas‚Äô, were observed to have joined in directly with the abuse. Thirty of the persistent offenders have since been found to be posting on the network, often under usernames only slightly altered.

The drug companies Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna are poised to make billions of dollars from Covid-19 booster jabs this autumn, with analysts estimating that sales could rival the $6bn-a-year market for seasonal flu vaccines.
The UK government is expected to announce details of its booster programme in the coming days, based on formal advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, but the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has suggested the over-50s could be offered a dose along with their winter flu jabs.

It is not Alisson‚Äôs style to bask in individual glory but when even Neymar Jr is impressed by the goal that defined Liverpool‚Äôs fight to the finish last season there is no alternative. The impact of the goalkeeper‚Äôs remarkable 95th-minute header at the Hawthorns in May reverberated throughout a long-awaited and emotional return home this summer.
‚ÄúEveryone I spoke to in Brazil, within two minutes they were always mentioning the goal,‚Äù says Alisson, who may be uncomfortable with the acclaim but is acutely aware of what his winner at West Brom meant for Liverpool‚Äôs pursuit of Champions League qualification and their confidence for the new Premier League campaign. ‚ÄúNeymar, everybody ‚Ä¶ they were all so excited about it.

It‚Äôs easy to laugh at the anti-vaccine movement, and this week they made it easier still. Hundreds of protesters tried to storm Television Centre in west London, apparently unaware that they were not at the headquarters of the BBC or its news operation ‚Äì which they blame for brainwashing the British public ‚Äì but at a building vacated by the corporation eight years ago and which now consists of luxury flats and daytime TV studios. If only they‚Äôd done their own research.
Anti-vax firebreather Piers Corbyn was there, of course, unabashed by the recent undercover sting that showed him happy to take ¬£10,000 in cash from what he thought was an AstraZeneca shareholder, while agreeing that he would exempt their product from his rhetorical fire. (Corbyn has since said that the published video is misleading.) ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to take over these bastards,‚Äù he said during this week‚Äôs protest, while inside Loose Women were discussing the menopause.

Richard Branson has sold a further $300m (¬£220m) stake in Virgin Galactic to raise more funds to prop up his airline, Virgin Atlantic, and other businesses hit hard by the pandemic.
It is the third time Sir Branson, 71, has sold a large tranche of shares in in his space tourism company since it joined the New York stock exchange in 2019. He sold $505m worth in May 2020 and $150m in April this year, taking his total stake sales to almost $1bn. He still holds about 46m shares worth $1.2bn.

Amid the celebrations by students getting their A-level and GCSE results this week, it almost passed without notice that girls had stormed the last bastion of male academic attainment by capturing more top grades in maths than boys in both qualifications.
The twin triumph confirms what has long been known among educationists: in formal learning females outperform males at every level and every age group, from the early years through to Sats, GCSEs, A-levels, university admissions and degree classifications. It happens not only in the UK but in every developed country, with few exceptions.

With Afghan government forces in disarray, and amid reports that the vice-president has fled, the Taliban are heading inexorably towards Kabul. They control more than two-thirds of the country, just as the US plans to pull out its last remaining troops.

                    <span>Chinese film-maker Zheng Lu Xinyuan makes her debut with a dreamlike distillation of a young woman‚Äôs alienation from family and friends
‚ÄúA few days ago, I met someone.‚Äù A woman makes the confession matter-of-factly to her on-off boyfriend as they try to find somewhere for dinner. At that moment the camera pans up to the sky, and when it fades back to the street, the couple have gone, vanished into thin air. It‚Äôs not the only time that Chinese film-maker Zheng Lu Xinyuan, making her feature debut, cuts away from characters at precisely the moment another director would go in for a close-up; it may drive you crackers.
This film is pure slow-burn arthouse, shot in black and white, the format dominated by flashbacks ‚Äì perfect for a film that drifts along on scraps and dreamlike fragments. It follows aimless 22-year-old Muzi (Jin Jing) who is back in her hometown, Hangzhou, visiting her folks for Chinese new year. Nothing much happens. In an early scene a gay friend asks Muzi to have a baby for him; his parents are desperate for a grandchild. Her boyfriend, a sensitive, shaggy-haired photographer (Zhou Chen), shows up unexpectedly from Beijing. Muzi is also flirting with a local bar owner (Dong Kangning) who clearly rates himself. Her parents have been divorced for years. She smokes cigarettes with her dad (Ye Hongming), an artist and jazz musician. A couple of scenes hint at emotional tensions with her mum (Dan Liu), a woman with the glamour and poise of a 1950s movie star; after a drunken karaoke session, her mum is sick on the street. When Muzi leans down to help, mum roughly shoves her away.

Many more people around the world will die of Covid if western political leaders ‚Äúreject their responsibility to the rest of humanity‚Äù by prioritising booster shots for their own populations instead of sharing doses, the head of the Oxford vaccine group has warned.
Writing for the Guardian, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, and Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, say that the scientific and public health case for large-scale boosting has not been made and could have far-reaching consequences in other countries.

Prof Alan Finlayson is right to question Labour‚Äôs approach to values when it is treated as a hollow exercise in developing ‚Äúclearer, sharper, more uplifting messaging‚Äù (Labour‚Äôs preoccupation with ‚Äòvalues‚Äô is a basic political error, 6 August).
Simply communicating Labour party values is unlikely to win an electoral majority, particularly if it appears as an opportunistic alignment with the perceived values of the electorate. That would indeed amount to abandoning political leadership in the hope of gaining short-term party popularity.

                    <span>Dr Adrian James says making more places available at medical schools will be a positive development for the NHS and for patients 
The increase in medical school places might be causing understandable challenges for universities, but training more doctors is nothing but a positive development for the future of the NHS and our health (Grade inflation forces ministers to pay for extra medical school places, 5 August).
We simply do not have enough doctors, which means poorer quality care, excessive workloads and higher levels of burnout. If we fail to ensure a sustainable supply of doctors, the NHS will struggle to meet future demand and patients will suffer.

Record Mediterranean heatwaves fuelled blazes that have devastated parts of Italy, Turkey and Algeria, with Spain and Portugal on high alert, while Turkey‚Äôs Black Sea region has been hit by some of the worst floods in living memory.

‚Ä¢ Read other authors on their memorable urban summers
It had been raining all day the way an old goat pees, in fits and starts, with bleats of sunshine in between. This was a weekday in July 2007, the magical year I moved to Lagos, and only a few months into the nine-to-five that lured me over. The excitement of waking up every day at 5am and catching a jam-packed danfo bus for the two-hour commute had since curdled in my wannabe-writer‚Äôs heart. I was standing at Obalende bus stop that afternoon after work, with no bus in sight for the past 40 minutes and rumours of a citywide gridlock swirling around, when the rain started again, a sun shower, proof, they say, that a lion is being born.
Fare hikes were expected on days of heavy traffic, but this time the fare had tripled. Outraged howls rent the air

Glute abduction Like the crab walk, this works your hips hard by driving your knees outward (known as abduction), but, because the hips are more flexed, you will activate the gluteus maximus in your bottom (the largest muscle in the body) much more. This exercise will support your back, and is great for hip and knee stability, which is especially helpful if you are a runner.

However, his ambitions have been stymied by his failure to publish a roadmap on how to achieve the cuts, and a vocal group on the right of his party has begun to undermine the target by questioning the high price to consumers ‚Äì ignoring the costs of inaction.

Bloodcurdling shrieks from Downing Street, where Boris Johnson recently beheld a most enraging sight in his magic mirror (bespoke handcrafted rattan, Soane, price on application). Instead of responding to his daily question ‚ÄúWho is the most popular of all?‚Äù by reflecting Johnson‚Äôs own smirking visage back at him, the looking-glass has been displaying the image of young Rishi Sunak riding his Peloton bike right up in the prime ministerial grill.
Shortly after Johnson appointed Sunak, his relations with the new chancellor were described as ‚Äúhand in glove‚Äù. Unfortunately, Rishi now seems to have tired of the cavity search. The recent leak of his letter challenging Johnson on Covid travel restrictions has enraged the boss whose entire career has been characterised by exactly this type of posturing disloyalty. Amusingly, it seems the prime minister never even saw the supposedly private letter from his chancellor before it was leaked, with Johnson‚Äôs defenders saying it should obviously have been put in his red box. Yet even that feels debatable. Hard to say where the best place to put a document you really need the PM to read is. Tinder? Certainly he is said to swipe left on most work-related things placed in front of him.

                    <span>I was called aggressive for criticising passages in Kate Clanchy‚Äôs memoir. But the real problem lies deep in the overwhelmingly white world of publishing
It started with a tweet. Kate Clanchy, author of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me posted on her Twitter account that a reviewer on Goodreads had ‚Äúmade up a racist quote and said it was in my book‚Äù. She urged her almost 40,000 followers to flag the review that claimed she had bigoted views on race, class and body image, and had used terms such as ‚Äúchocolate-coloured skin‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish noses‚Äù. Prominent authors and columnists swooped in to offer support, decrying how Clanchy could possibly be subjected to such inhumane treatment ‚Äì including the current president of the Society of Authors, Philip Pullman, who declared: ‚ÄúBut of all the people and of all the books to have had this happen ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs hard to stay optimistic about the human race sometimes.‚Äù
However, it soon emerged that those terms were, in fact, in the book. Incredulous that antisemitic and anti-Black tropes could have made it into a book published as recently as 2019, I downloaded and read it. I recoiled as a Somali boy is described as having a ‚Äúnarrow skull‚Äù, while one Muslim girl is ‚Äúvery butch-looking ‚Ä¶ with a distinct moustache‚Äù, and another ‚Äúlooked brilliant because she has such a strong skull shape‚Äù, which sounds more like something a eugenicist might observe than a trusted teacher. There is a troubling exchange where Clanchy is baffled by a boy who, with his jet-black hair and eyes and ‚Äúfine Ashkenazi nose‚Äù, denies Jewish heritage. She draws her own conclusion that his family must not want to remember that they‚Äôre only seven generations down from a pogrom. After reading about Cypriot bosoms ‚Äì on a child ‚Äì and ‚Äúflirty hijabs‚Äù, I wondered what readers would have felt about a male teacher describing children‚Äôs bodies in this way.

Analysts and experts are warning of many years of instability across Africa, possibly leading to wars and political upheavals, as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic deepens across the continent.
Though many of the likely consequences are yet to become evident, recent unrest in southern Africa, increased extremist violence in the Sahel and growing instability in parts of west Africa can all be attributed in part to the outbreak, observers say.

                    <span>Blazes raging in southern regions have ravaged mountain area of Calabria that is home to Unesco world heritage site
As with most farmers living in the remote towns of the Aspromonte mountain range in Calabria, southern Italy, Nicola Fortugno‚Äôs land was his life. The 79-year-old refused to be evacuated when flames engulfed Piraino, a hamlet surrounded by pine forest above the town of Cardeto, on Wednesday. Instead, he stayed at home to try to save his animals and crops. His burnt, lifeless body was found by firefighters.
‚ÄúI used to see Nicola whenever he came to town to go to the chemist or see the doctor,‚Äù said Francesca Crea, owner of the newspaper shop in Cardeto. ‚ÄúHis death is very painful as we‚Äôre a community of mostly farmers, people who make great sacrifices for a small patch of land ‚Äì the animals are their treasures.‚Äù

The billionaire boss of South Korea‚Äôs Samsung empire has been released from prison after serving 18 months of a 30-month sentence for bribing the former president of South Korea Park Geun-hye.
Lee Jae-yong, Samsung‚Äôs vice-chair and de facto leader, apologised to the country for his actions upon his release from Seoul detention centre. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve caused much concern for the people.

Have you been watching GB News? It fascinates me. Whatever you say about the TV channel‚Äôs politics; whatever debate you‚Äôve been having about who annoys you the most on there, you have to respect somebody deciding to start a news channel in 2021. It demonstrates just the kind of plucky British spirit that they will surely spend many hours discussing the erosion of, live on air.
One of the latest additions to the channel is comedian and presenter Mark Dolan. I have worked with him a few times and always thought he was nice, and still do. In a recent interview I saw on the channel with Dan Wootton, Dolan made a point that I thought was quite interesting, as it highlighted the challenge of positioning yourself as anti the ‚Äúwoke agenda‚Äù or whatever you want to call it.

                    <span>There‚Äôs no evidence yet that top-up shots are needed, so let‚Äôs help those around the world who urgently need the vaccine

Andrew Pollard is director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford; Seth Berkley is the chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance

Since early 2020, the tragic reality of the pandemic has unfolded, killing millions, disrupting normal social interactions, destabilising economies and plunging the world into uncertainty. Between 4.3 and 11.6 million people have died. Amid this deepening gloom, vaccines have brought hope. Their development is a triumph of science; the manufacture and deployment of 4.4bn doses by a handful of developers is astonishing, joyous. In the UK alone, 87m doses have been administered, saving more than 84,000 lives. Globally, the number of lives saved by vaccines is expected to be in the millions.
So why is there still so much suffering around the world? Thousands of people are still dying of Covid every week. Hospitals are overwhelmed and many countries are in despair, urgently pleading for vaccines because they have virtually none. We are in this position simply because the doses we have are not being distributed first to those who are at highest risk of getting seriously ill or worse yet, dying. The vast majority of people who will die of Covid this year could have been saved if we had got this right. Vaccinating those at risk everywhere is in our self-interest. It may reduce the risk of new variants arising, and will relieve pressure on health systems, open travel, resuscitate the global economy, and raise the international authority of politicians prepared to take such moral leadership.

Motorhomes and caravans have been banned from joining standby queues for ferries to Scottish islands after a tide of anger from islanders about overwhelmed services.
CalMac, the state-owned ferry company, has decided motorhomes, camper vans and caravans will only be allowed on their services if they have a confirmed reservation, in a bid to placate furious islanders.

Chuck in some videos featuring handmade wall art in ‚Äúgroovy chick‚Äù colourways and a dollop of ironic goofiness and Lee‚Äôs ‚Äúspokesperson of Gen Z‚Äù status is pretty much assured. A case in point: when she logged on to Zoom for our interview, she asked: ‚ÄúWill we put this out as a video?‚Äù which made me feel ancient (and horrified).

                    <span>Even before the western withdrawal and Taliban resurgence, the country was on its knees. A refugee crisis is now inevitable
In recent days, a ferocious wave of fighting has enveloped Afghanistan as the Taliban take more and more territory from the Afghan government. The developing situation makes it extremely difficult to predict how the coming weeks and months will unfold in the country. One thing we do know, however, is that while most media commentary focuses on who has the upper hand militarily, the country inevitably faces a humanitarian catastrophe. Ordinary Afghans are confronted with a triple calamity: dire security, health and economic prospects. These cruel conditions predate the Trump administration‚Äôs Doha agreement with the Taliban in February 2020, which began the process of US military withdrawal; they also predate President Biden‚Äôs confirmation that full withdrawal will occur by 11 September this year.
Afghanistan entered 2021 already in dire straits, with more than 18 million Afghans ‚Äì nearly half the population ‚Äì in humanitarian need. Dwindling international aid, a violent conflict, weak governance and environmental challenges such as droughts have all contributed. The impact of the pandemic last year meant that in January 2021 Afghanistan had the world‚Äôs second-highest number of people facing emergency food insecurity.

There‚Äôs an old saying in Afghanistan that encapsulates the country‚Äôs views on divorce: ‚ÄúA woman only leaves her father‚Äôs house in the white bridal clothes, and she can only return in the white shrouds.‚Äù
In this deeply conservative and patriarchal society, women who defy convention and seek divorce are often disowned by their families and shunned by Afghan society. Left alone, they have to fight for basic rights, such as renting an apartment, which require the involvement or guarantees of male relatives.

                    <span>The popularity of the women‚Äôs Hundred has taken everyone by surprise and the record-breaking crowds look like seriously challenging those of women‚Äôs football
A few years ago I wrote a piece on ‚Äúdouble-header‚Äù matches ‚Äì the phenomenon whereby a women‚Äôs match is played directly before a men‚Äôs match in an effort to increase crowd sizes for the women. The headline will give you an idea of my view: ‚ÄúDouble headers are the future ‚Äì but they stink‚Äù.
When I found out, therefore, that the inaugural edition of the England and Wales Cricket Board‚Äôs new competition, the Hundred, would be played almost entirely as double headers, my heart sank. I envisaged the women‚Äôs matches relegated to ‚Äúwarm-up‚Äù status; press boxes filled with retrograde journalists who only bothered to turn up to cover the men; female players being hurried along by the umpires to make way for the day‚Äôs ‚Äúmain event‚Äù; crowds who arrived to watch the men. In the 10 years I have been covering women‚Äôs cricket, these have all been regular occurrences at double headers in England and around the world.

The first response many of us have to a cancer diagnosis is terror, horror and the conviction that we‚Äôre doomed. For those who haven‚Äôt been paying serious ongoing attention to climate chaos, reminders that we are facing catastrophe can bring the same kind of response. But if you‚Äôve been through cancer or been close to people who have, you know that the usual next phase is figuring out what the treatment options are and, in most cases, going all out for them. The good news is going to be that you got approved for a promising new treatment, are responding well, you are in remission, feel healthier, have a good prognosis. That there are things worth doing that make a difference.
Climate change is a nightmare, and this summer‚Äôs floods, fires and extreme heat, from China to Siberia to British Columbia, are reminders that the problem is rapidly growing worse. Yet the striking thing about the IPCC report released earlier this month is not the bad news, which is not really news at all for those who have followed the science closely. It‚Äôs the clarity about possibilities, which I found hopeful.

                    <span>Experts say chancellor refusing to commit spending needed to shift economy to low-carbon footing
The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK‚Äôs own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian.
A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future.

                    <span>Regime looking to shift focus from domestic problems with rhetoric around US-South Korea military drills, say analysts



North Korea‚Äôs threat to boost its military capacity to counter hostility from Washington before joint US-South Korea military drills is intended to divert attention from its economic crisis but could lead to a resumption of missile tests, according to analysts.
While there is nothing unusual about North Korean opposition to the summer exercises involving American and South Korean forces, its warning this week that Seoul and Washington faced ‚Äúgreater security threats‚Äù comes from a position of weakness not seen since Kim Jong-un came to power a decade ago.

When I was seven, there was something on television about a gay politician. My mum, with great vitriol, said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù I thought, I had better not tell her about my views on the matter because she might reject me. I was too frightened.
I knew I was gay then, but I didn‚Äôt come out until I was 30. While I kept my sexuality a secret, music meant a lot to me: it had an allure that I felt certain men also had ‚Äì but in both cases I couldn‚Äôt quite express it.

One of the hard-and-fast rules about dining out, alongside never trying to eat the hot towel or order the wine called ‚ÄúCorkage‚Äù because it seems the most reasonably priced, is never to get the chef talking about sustainability. Never. For many, you see, it‚Äôs their obsession, and at The Loch &amp; The Tyne in Old Windsor, before you know it, you could be perusing the eco-garden and composting area on a V√©losophy bike made out of recycled Nespresso pods. That said, The Loch &amp; The Tyne is an Adam Handling venture, run by his trusted, longstanding cohorts Steven Kerr and Jonathan McNeil, so if you were to break that rule, this is the place to do it.
Handling‚Äôs approach to food waste has always been delicious, luxurious and playful ... we&#x27;re a long way from worthy.

Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the state of New York, resigned this week after the publication of a report alleging that he sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo denies any wrongdoing but after fighting on for a week announced he would step aside on Tuesday. 
Ed Pilkington, the chief reporter of Guardian US, tells Rachel Humphreys that the move marks the downfall of one of the most powerful figures in the Democratic party. He was instrumental in passing liberal reforms on gay marriage, minimum wage and strengthening laws on sexual harassment. But the release of the report documents another story: of multiple allegations of harassment of women.

Texas Republicans have deputized law enforcement to find House Democrats who have fled the state capitol in order to deny the quorum needed to pass dramatic new voting restrictions. 
Law enforcement has been tasked with bringing in Democrats after the state Supreme Court allowed for their civil arrests. ‚ÄúEarlier today the House Sergeant-at-Arms deputized members of Texas law enforcement to assist in the House‚Äôs efforts to compel a quorum. That process will begin in earnest immediately,‚Äù said Enrique Marquez, a spokesman for Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan, in a statement.

                    <span>Opposition figure, lawyers and former envoy among latest detained in six cities a year after disputed presidential poll
Belarusian authorities have detained more than 20 people in the latest wave of arrests, continuing their sweeping crackdown on dissent a year after a disputed presidential election, human rights activists say. 
Belarus was rocked by protests which were fuelled by the 9 August 2020 re-election of the authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, to a sixth term in a vote that the opposition and the west rejected as a sham. Lukashenko responded to the demonstrations, the largest of which drew up to 200,000 people, with huge repressions in which more than 35,000 people were arrested and thousands beaten by police.
Belarusian authorities have ramped up the clampdown in recent months, arresting scores of independent journalists, activists and all those deemed not loyal. The Viasna human rights centre said on Thursday that more than 20 people have been detained over the past two days in six cities across the country.

The Pentagon announced it would send three battalions, about 3,000 soldiers, to Kabul‚Äôs international airport within 24 to 48 hours of the announcement on Thursday. The defence department spokesman, John Kirby, said the reinforcements would help the ‚Äúsafe and orderly reduction‚Äù of US nationals and Afghans who worked with the Americans and consequently had been granted special immigrant visas.

Despite having gone off the air in 2018, the BBC mockumentary series People Just Do Nothing, centred on the defiantly clueless crew of a west London pirate radio station, has continued to grow a cult audience. So a movie spinoff is well-deserved and much anticipated, even if, like its smalltime protagonists, it is hardly destined for mass appeal.

About one in 10 patients were infected with coronavirus while in hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK ‚Äì and that figure rose to about one in six after the peak of Covid hospital admissions, researchers have found.
However, vaccines, improvements in diagnostics and PPE supply, and an enhanced understanding of the virus have dramatically reduced the risk of catching Covid in hospital settings, they stressed. ‚ÄúThings have changed for the better, enormously,‚Äù said Dr Christopher Green, a senior clinical lecturer &amp; consultant physician in infectious diseases at the University of Birmingham.

From AP Bio to Mr Corman, it seems the disaffected teacher has become a sitcom staple in recent times, and here is Flatbush Misdemeanours (Sky Comedy) with another one. This ramshackle newcomer is based on a 2017 web series created by and starring comedians Kevin Iso and Dan Perlman, who make a seamless transition to television here. Those who like their sitcoms with a bit of oomph may find this too laid-back, but underneath its low-key demeanour lies a fresh and charming series.
We follow childhood best friends Kevin and Dan, reunited as flatmates (if you can call them flatmates ‚Äì Kevin is crashing on Dan‚Äôs couch, and briefly, on his floor) in the Flatbush district of Brooklyn, New York City. Dan is the teacher, presiding over lively teenagers who would mostly rather not be in his classroom, while Kevin is a painter who has recently moved back to the city from New Orleans and is trying to make his way as an artist.

Hibernian exit Conference League at hands of Croatia‚Äôs Rijeka

St Johnstone suffered a 5-3 Europa League exit to Galatasaray at McDiarmid Park.
Scotland‚Äôs domestic double cup winners had drawn 1-1 with the visitors in the first leg of their Europa League third qualifying round in Istanbul last week but the second leg proved just too much.

Jamie Spears has agreed to step down from his long time role as conservator of his daughter Britney Spears‚Äô estate ‚Äúwhen the time is right,‚Äù according to court filings.
Jamie Spears‚Äô departure would mark a significant development in the singer‚Äôs long fight to be freed from her father‚Äôs control. The developments come nearly two months after the singer spoke in court and called for an end to the controversial arrangement that has controlled her life for 13 years, giving her father and others authority over her personal life and career.

10,464 days. 31 years. 34 successive defeats. But all records are there to be broken ‚Äì and how everyone associated with Castleford Tigers will enjoy this victory, their first in the league at St Helens since 1990 and one that could yet keep their hopes of a first Super League title well and truly alive.
Castleford‚Äôs season was sinking without a trace. Defeat at Wembley in the Challenge Cup final, plus seven losses in eight in Super League, left many fearing that Daryl Powell‚Äôs final season at his hometown club would end rather meekly, with the Tigers failing to make the play-offs and ending his eight-year spell in charge in somewhat forgettable fashion.

‚Ä¢ Rose Ayling-Ellis to be Strictly‚Äôs first deaf contestant
Deafness has long been interpreted, incorrectly, as total silence. As such, Deafness and music are also wrongly seen as things which are incompatible with one another. Everyday language such as ‚Äútone deaf‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help, nor does a lack of representation when it comes to deaf people in music and dance. However, Rose Ayling-Ellis may be about to challenge misconceptions on a major scale, as the first deaf contestant on Strictly Come Dancing.
Ayling-Ellis, who plays Frankie Lewis in EastEnders, has said that appearing on the show is: ‚Äúexciting and a little bit scary ‚Ä¶ I hope I will do the deaf community proud and break down more barriers.‚Äù

GCSE results this year have revealed a widening attainment gap between pupils at selective schools and those from other state schools. In particular the gap affecting disadvantaged children was branded ‚Äúunforgiveable‚Äù by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.
It followed the trend in A-levels this week when pupils at independent schools stretched ahead of their state school counterparts in achieving top grades.

It wasn‚Äôt quite like that, of course.

                    <span>From Hunt the Sausage to Kate Moss‚Äôs prank call game, the funnyman and tabloid fixture made Radio 1 essential listening. It will be all the poorer without him

When Nick Grimshaw was given the Radio 1 breakfast show presenting job in 2012, it wasn‚Äôt merely a personnel change ‚Äì his appointment marked a meaningful generational shift. The previous host, Chris Moyles, was known for his blokey banter and litany of politically incorrect jokes. Grimmy was his decidedly un-laddy replacement, a radio funnyman for a more inclusive age ‚Äì one where casual bigotry, or even just hurting people‚Äôs feelings, was no longer a laugh.
Now, as Grimshaw hangs up his headphones ‚Äì hot on the heels of fellow Radio 1 stalwart Annie Mac ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to take stock of the youth-oriented entertainment epoch he has helmed for over a decade. While Grimshaw never courted controversy, he certainly wasn‚Äôt bland. In fact, his vaguely camp, intensely pally style didn‚Äôt sit well with everyone, and his breakfast tenure was plagued by reports of low listening figures. But for those on his wavelength, Grimshaw made Radio 1 seem an unbeatable start to the day for the first time in a lifetime ‚Äì and the phrase ‚ÄòRadio 1 comedy‚Äô no longer a contradiction in terms.

Rahul racks up unbeaten 127 after England choose to bowl

When England left Trent Bridge on Sunday they could at least draw comfort from the great unknown of a washed-out final day. A heavy dose of reality followed at Lord‚Äôs, however, with India dominating the opening exchanges of this second Test thanks to a sublime unbeaten century from KL Rahul.
As the two sides walked off the field at 7.21pm, the tourists had progressed to 276 for three from 90 overs and Rahul was indelibly 127 not out from 248 balls. Ollie Robinson struck late on to remove Virat Kohli for 42, while Jimmy Anderson had shrugged off fitness concerns to deliver two wickets. But this was not Joe Root‚Äôs vision when he won the toss under leaden skies and elected to bowl.

The deep south state, where only 35.6% of residents are fully vaccinated, is opening a 50-bed field hospital at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) car park with the assistance of the federal government as officials brace for a climbing death toll and ICU units reach capacity.

At a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, a gunman opened fire. After filling the cinema with teargas, he shot at the audience, injuring 70 and killing 12. Shockingly, it is far from being the worst atrocity of its kind in the US.
Kate Barton‚Äôs verbatim play for the young Piccolo theatre company focuses on four of the survivors. It traces the buildup to the new Batman movie, the confusion of the mid-screening attack, the horror of the immediate aftermath and the long reckoning that followed.

The first few years of a child‚Äôs life are critical to their cognitive development. But with Covid-19 triggering the closure of businesses, nurseries, schools and playgrounds, life for infants changed considerably, with parents stressed and stretched as they tried to balance work and childcare.

Adidas is selling Reebok to the US brand management company Authentic Brands Group for up to ‚Ç¨2.1bn (¬£1.8bn), as the German sportswear firm concentrates on its core marque after pressure from investors.
Reebok was bought for ‚Ç¨3.1bn in 2006 in a blockbuster deal designed to help the trainers and clothing company take on rival Nike, but it never returned to its 1980s heyday and Adidas investors demanded action.

Experts say the work not only sheds light on the movements of the giant proboscideans, but adds weight to ideas that climate change or human activity may have contributed to the demise of most of the creatures about 12,000 years ago.

In its latest report, released on Thursday, the Pew Research Center surveyed 10,221 US adults in July in attempts to understand how the American public views the country‚Äôs progress towards ensuring equal rights for all Americans, regardless of their ethnic or racial backgrounds.

An international team of researchers has tracked the total daily energy expenditure of more than 6,000 people aged from eight days to 95 years, turning many tropes about metabolism on their heads.

Una Stubbs: a life in pictures

Bright and bubbly, tart and twinkly, Una Stubbs, who has died aged 84, was a revue regular and a Palladium pantomime principal boy who parlayed her natural song-and-dance talent into a later, diverse career on the classical stage.
In earlier years she was best known as Cliff Richard‚Äôs girlfriend in two high-spirited pop musical movies ‚Äì Summer Holiday (1963) and Wonderful Life (1964) ‚Äì and as Alf Garnett‚Äôs daughter, Rita Rawlins, married to a socialist layabout (Anthony Booth, Cherie Blair‚Äôs father and so Tony‚Äôs father-in-law), in Johnny Speight‚Äôs classic TV series Till Death Us Do Part (1965‚Äë75) and in episodes of its 1980s sequel, In Sickness and in Health.

It borders on smug, devotees telling you that starters can be over a century old, while some of us see sourdough akin to houseplants: a nice idea but ultimately something else to kill. So is a packet of dry yeast a cheat, or the preserve of true home bakers?

There should be no disputing that, if they are true, the sexual abuse allegations made by Virginia Giuffre against Prince Andrew, the Queen‚Äôs second son, are serious. Nor can there be any denying that the seriousness, if it is established, would be both personal and also more widely political.
Ms Giuffre alleges that Prince Andrew had sex with her in London in 2001 when she was 17, and was thus still a minor under US (though not English) law, and that the prince knew she had been trafficked by his friend, the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ms Giuffre also claims that Epstein paid her $15,000 for the encounter.

                    <span>They may be smaller and quieter than they once were, but Scotland‚Äôs capital has its summer arts events, and even some visitors, back
The Edinburgh festivals are back ‚Äì but not as we know them. Last year was the first time since their founding in 1947 that the international festival and its restless, noisy sibling, the fringe, were cancelled. The Edinburgh international book festival, in the meantime, went digital, and found an audience online. This year the book festival‚Äôs model is hybrid. It has moved from its former digs in Charlotte Square to the Edinburgh College of Art, from where events with a live audience will be streamed. Though capacity for in-person audiences, socially distanced, is relatively small, a big screen outdoors will relay events to those visiting its ‚Äúvillage green‚Äù, which will be equipped with a bookshop, cafe ‚Äì and, it is hoped, an actual festival atmosphere.
The international festival has created a number of outdoor venues ‚Äì shielded from the rain by temporary structures that bear a passing resemblance to polytunnels ‚Äì in locations such as Edinburgh University‚Äôs Old College Quad. Attempting to mount an international festival in a time of international travel restrictions must be considered a logistical nightmare, but that has opened up the chance for more local events and new kinds of collaboration ‚Äì such as traditional musician Aidan O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs meditation on ‚ÄúLittle Ireland‚Äù, the part of Edinburgh‚Äôs Old Town in which he lives, this past year emptied of its usual roving population of tourists. The project will see O‚ÄôRourke performing with Irish musicians, and a film made with fellow Edinburgh-dweller, film-maker Mark Cousins.

However, the coffee shop chain has not reversed a decision to cease paying for break times, so that a worker on an eight-hour shift, including a legally required half-hour break, will still see a pay cut of just over 6% a shift v pre-pandemic levels.

Russia has reportedly detained the head of a hypersonic technology research facility on suspicion of treason in the latest high-profile arrest targeting a senior scientist for allegedly selling state secrets.
Alexander Kuranov, 73, the general director of the St Petersburg-based Hypersonic System Research Institute (HSRI), was arrested in Moscow on Thursday. A Moscow court ruled he be held for two months in pre-trial detention.

                    <span>From voter ID rules to restrictions on protest, repressive measures are on the UK government‚Äôs post-pandemic agenda
As a bewildered country blinks in the tentative daylight of freedom, after nearly a year and a half of unprecedented restrictions, a wider struggle to restore our sacred freedoms is surely overdue. Despite cynical attempts by some commentators to brand Boris Johnson a ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù ‚Äì in practice, he is a man who cherishes freedoms only for his own class ‚Äì his is a nakedly authoritarian government.
It would be unwise to concede this fact to Covid conspiracists, who are as noisy as they are peripheral in public opinion. It is possible to believe, for instance, that an extraordinary national emergency required lockdown, but that implementing it sooner in early 2020 would have suppressed the public health crisis more quickly, meaning restrictions on freedoms would have been shorter lived. The government‚Äôs focus on law-breaking during the pandemic ‚Äì rather than greater financial support for self-isolation or the hiking of a statutory sick pay that remains among the lowest of the rich countries ‚Äì is further evidence of its authoritarian credentials.

The boy was physically and chemically restrained in hospital last month. The disruption meant seriously ill children had to be moved to hospitals miles away, because Wigan council could not find a specialised care placement for him in the community, the high court heard.

Ministers, civil service leaders and employers are ‚Äúwrongheaded‚Äù to be trying to make people come back to the office against their will, and should not be standing in the way of progress around working from home, Keir Starmer has said.
Speaking to the Guardian, the Labour leader said it was wrong for people to be forced back into offices when it was the government that had asked them to work from home in the first place, especially if they were being threatened with pay cuts or the loss of London weighting from their salaries.

                    <span>Readers respond to an article by Frances Crook, the outgoing head of the Howard League for Penal Reform, about the need for radical change to the prison system
Frances Crook has been a voice of reason in the charity sector for 35 years (The reform of prisons has been my life‚Äôs work, but they are still utterly broken, 10 August). Like her, I have led several charities to make some sense of imprisonment and to help people come back into the community better, not worse. She is right that reform is at the bottom of the agenda for recent governments, irrespective of the fact that it costs us all a lot of money.
How many people know that a year in prison costs about ¬£40,000, somewhat more than private schools? The total cost of the roughly 80,000 prisoners in the system is more than ¬£3bn a year. Budgets have been cut year after year and all but the most basic education projects have largely ceased to exist. I chair the board of a small charity, Sussex Pathways, which provides volunteer key workers who work on a release plan with prison residents on a one-to-one basis for about three months, looking at an individual‚Äôs needs including housing, health, addictions, education, family ties, employment and so on. The reduction in the likelihood of reoffending is about 80%, whereas without this support, it‚Äôs the exact opposite. It shouldn‚Äôt just be down to charities to try to mend some of the most challenging of society‚Äôs ills.

A huge thank you for publishing the podcast about baby loss and miscarriage (Today in Focus, 9 August). My husband and I are currently experiencing our third loss, after the stillbirth of our baby boy and a previous miscarriage, and I felt relief to hear a story like mine in a national newspaper.
Despite our losses, we have also been told to keep trying and that there is most likely ‚Äúno reason‚Äù, with normal tests and results, and that our son, who died in the womb at 25 weeks, was perfectly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. The stigma around this conversation has also been a struggle and we often feel isolated among friends who haven‚Äôt experienced loss or miscarriage. I remember thinking after my first loss, if this is so common why do I never hear about it? The mental and physical health battles are very real and, because of a lack of understanding on the subject, people are ill-equipped to support and comfort us in this journey.

On its summer break after a blistering first half of the season, Formula One continues to bask in the warm glow of Lewis Hamilton‚Äôs and Max Verstappen‚Äôs gripping title fight. The pair have a chance to relax now but it is likely neither will be able to completely banish from their minds the consideration of what comes next, who has the edge and the pressing concern of where and when they will resume battle.
F1 has completed 11 races, with Hamilton leading Verstappen by eight points after turning round a deficit that stood at 33 before the British Grand Prix. The sport‚Äôs intent is that they should conclude their fight over 12 more races to take the season to 23 ‚Äì the stated aim at the beginning of the year and a record number in a single campaign.

More than a century later, with collapsing chimneys and extensive rot, the ‚Äúright owner‚Äù is now sought for the category A listed building and its extensive grounds ‚Äì which included a Japanese garden and glasshouses filled with hummingbirds and, briefly, small alligators ‚Äì after several stalled restoration attempts.

                    <span>With car chases and shootouts, it may feel like a Hollywood action flick, but, as the director, Hogir Hirori, explains, the film is really about the exploited women and girls there
In August 2014, after Islamic State (Isis) militants attacked the Sinjar district in northern Iraq, Hogir Hirori realised his calling. Although he had been living in Sweden since 1999, his home town was only about two hours‚Äô drive from Sinjar.
‚ÄúWhen Daesh [Isis] attacked, I realised that I could tell these stories in a really specific way,‚Äù he says, speaking via video from Stockholm. ‚ÄúI knew the culture and the language, and I‚Äôve been a refugee all my life, so I had the understanding and the insights to do these documentaries very well.‚Äù Hirori had trained in media production and worked in Swedish television, but he had never before addressed an international audience. The news coming out of Sinjar changed all that.

                    <span>As Tate faces potential legal action from a Francis Bacon donor, British galleries‚Äô relationships with private collectors need more scrutiny
With squeezed budgets, British museums are increasingly relying on private patronage, for financial support and donation of artworks. Yet while the former has faced close scrutiny in recent years, the latter have received little attention.
Now Tate faces potential legal action from one donor, Barry Joule, over his disputed claim that the British gallery has not honoured the terms under which he donated 1,200 sketches, photographs and documents from the studio of his late friend, the artist Francis Bacon.

Global greenhouse gas emissions must peak in the next four years, coal and gas-fired power plants must close in the next decade and lifestyle and behavioural changes will be needed to avoid climate breakdown, according to the leaked draft of a report from the world‚Äôs leading authority on climate science.
Rich people in every country are overwhelmingly more responsible for global heating than the poor, with SUVs and meat-eating singled out for blame, and the high-carbon basis for future economic growth is also questioned.

Britain‚Äôs most senior police officer has said ‚Äúno one is above the law‚Äù when questioned about allegations of sexual assault against Prince Andrew.
Dame Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, spoke after a lawyer for Virginia Giuffre, the woman who has accused the Duke of York of sexually abusing her while she was a minor, said he must not be allowed to hide behind his wealth and power to avoid the civil suit she has brought in the US.

Despite years of development, investment and progress in the Afghan media industry, 28-year-old Zahra Joya often found she was the only woman in a newsroom. ‚ÄúIt was a lonely space, dominated by men who made the decisions about which stories were important, and which were not,‚Äù she says.
Joya, who is from the persecuted Hazara community, felt she faced discrimination because of her ethnicity and sex. ‚ÄúThere were so few women journalists in Kabul,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere would hardly be women reporters covering political events or press conferences even though these stories affect us greatly.‚Äù

                    <span>O2 Arena, London
Pop‚Äôs longest-serving imaginary band fill the reopened venue with deceptive chaos and the delight of feeling part of something again
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a joy to be back,‚Äù says Gorillaz‚Äôs human representative, Damon Albarn, addressing a full and bouncing O2 Arena. ‚ÄúThousands of people communing together. What a wonderful feeling. Thank you.‚Äù The crowd roar as if they haven‚Äôt been to a gig in 18 months.
Who‚Äôd have thought that pop‚Äôs longest-serving imaginary band ‚Äì as youthfully bony as when they were first drawn by artist Jamie Hewlett in 1998 ‚Äì would make a little real-life history by being the first act to play the reopened O2 Arena? Gorillaz and the O2 aren‚Äôt natural bedfellows, the former being ramshackle punk/dub/hip-hop futurists and the latter London‚Äôs most impersonal venue, but the arena is the only place large enough to hold them, in all senses. Outside, a gigantic queue snakes around crash barriers, and that‚Äôs just to buy hoodies; inside, every seat is occupied, and the stage itself teems with musicians, special guests and, onscreen, the gurning cartoon Gorillaz: Murdoc, Noodle, Russel and 2D. This is, in every respect, a big show.
