Four space tourists ended their trailblazing trip to orbit on Saturday with a splashdown in the Atlantic off the Florida coast.
Their SpaceX capsule parachuted into the ocean just before sunset, not far from where their chartered flight began three days earlier.

                    <span>With its cosy socks, simmering hotpots and scary festivals, autumn is rich in tradition. But should we insist on fetishising a season of rain, fading light and tedious poetry?
Depending on your view, autumn has a bad rap, or an easy time of it. Overdue a renaissance or passé to even admit liking at all. As a child, I considered autumn the red-headed stepchild of the calendar. It was the end of summer. It was back to school. It was a period in which blue skies turned white and the sun started showing up less and less, like texts from a friend you’d made on holiday. Then, in a strange move, the government would surgically remove an entire hour of sunlight, presumably at the behest of whatever grisly nest of vampires came up with daylight savings time.
So far, so bad. But autumn was also a twilight time of change and spookiness, of crisp air, Halloween and substantially better television programmes. Sure, it’s the time of school uniforms, but it’s also the time of soup and candles and, again, much better television programmes.

                    <span>Soaring prices will have some at the Bank itching to put up interest rates, but others will stress that now is a very bad time
Economic growth is losing steam and inflation is heading for boiling point. When the Bank of England’s rate-setters meet this week, there will be contrasting warning signs to consider.
With the most severe disruption to company supply chains since the 1970s, the recovery from last winter’s lockdown is practically stalling. Companies are struggling to recruit staff to keep the tills ringing, raw material costs have surged, and energy prices have hit record highs. All of this threatens to feed into higher inflation this autumn, after the consumer prices measure of annual inflation made a record jump in August, to 3.2%.

Liz Truss is heading for a furious diplomatic confrontation with France on her first trip abroad as foreign secretary, as anger mounts in Paris over the cancellation of a £48bn nuclear submarine contract.
Truss, whose appointment was one of the biggest surprises of Boris Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle last Wednesday, will arrive in the US on Sunday before a four-day visit to New York and Washington during which she is aiming to promote the prime minister’s vision of “global Britain” to international leaders.

The rapid fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban and the response to the Covid-19 pandemic have revealed “serious weaknesses” in the government’s approach to dealing with national security, according to a highly critical cross-party report.
MPs and peers found that the two critical events had highlighted the shortcomings of the national security council – a cabinet committee of senior ministers and officials designed to handle major security challenges. The Lords’ and Commons’ joint committee on the national security strategy (JCNSS) said the system had been exposed as inadequate. It warned that national risk management across government is “loose, unstructured, and lacking in central oversight and accountability”.

During the announcement that America, the United Kingdom and Australia had formed a new Aukus defence pact – inaugurated with the sale of American nuclear-powered submarines to Australia – Australian prime minister Scott Morrison lauded it as a “forever partnership for a new time between the oldest and most trusted of friends”.
That phrasing was notable given that the deal excluded New Zealand, which has historically been so close with Australia that the Australian constitution contemplates complete integration of the two countries. Remarkably, New Zealand’s government apparently only learned about the Aukus deal when it began to be reported in the media on Wednesday.

                    <span>Tottenham need to organise under Nuno Espírito Santo then ‘explore all the talent we have’, the left-back says
Sergio Reguilón remembers it with perfect clarity. “Like it was yesterday,” the Tottenham left-back says. And for overwhelmingly good reasons. It was August last year, he was at Sevilla and the match – the Europa League quarter-final against Wolves, then managed by Nuno Espírito Santo – would end in a last-gasp 1-0 victory. It was a staging post in Sevilla’s run to the trophy.
But what has also stayed with Reguilón is how they had to suffer; what it was like to face a Nuno team. “They were very strong defensively and it was so difficult because you haven’t got space to play,” he says. “When you have the ball, they are too compact, too aggressive. And with the ball, the transition … they are so dangerous on the counterattack.”

One of Borussia Dortmund’s English prodigies scored in the Champions League this week. It wasn’t Jadon Sancho. One of Manchester United’s summer signings struck on his first appearances in the Premier League and in Europe. It wasn’t Jadon Sancho.
While Jude Bellingham has assumed the winger’s old status as the prospect who should produce Dortmund a windfall if he returns to his homeland, Sancho has really been upstaged by Cristiano Ronaldo.

Four days earlier, the young high school student, full of hope in post-Suharto, Reformasi Indonesia, had joined hundreds of other independence activists to fly the Morning Star, the banned West Papuan flag, near Biak’s harbour.

A two-year-old girl has died after falling from a pony during a hunt meeting in North Yorkshire.
The toddler had been riding with members of the Bedale Hunt on land in a village near Northallerton on Wednesday morning when the incident occurred.

A few minutes before Paul Merson tells the surreal story which makes him cry, in a beautiful but broken memory, he looks at me intently. “It’s been 36 years of pure madness,” Merson says as he reflects on the gambling disorder which, coupled with alcoholism and a brief but ruinous addiction to cocaine, has scarred his life.
Merson won two league titles and three cups with Arsenal, while playing some visionary football which he produced again for Aston Villa. He won 21 caps for England, played in the 1998 World Cup and, now, at the age of 53, he is a much-loved, or often cruelly mocked, member of Sky Sports’ Saturday Soccer panel alongside his close friend Jeff Stelling.

xG is not a perfect tool. Models vary. They have flaws. But still, it is striking that most xG – expected goals – models for last season had Brighton finishing not 16th, as they actually did, but fifth or sixth. Imagine that had happened. Imagine Brighton, with the 15th-highest wage bill in the division, had qualified for the Europa League. It would have been an extraordinary achievement. Graham Potter might not have been named coach of the year ahead of Thomas Tuchel, but he would surely have nudged Marcelo Bielsa out of second.
More than that, Potter would have been a serious candidate to take the Tottenham job, rather than just somebody who was mentioned in passing. The (excessive) grumbling about Gareth Southgate would have a more sharply defined focus: here, the doubters would be able to say, is the ideal replacement. And yet the general tendency seems still to be to regard Potter as an oddity.

The government was scrambling on Saturday night to reassure Britons that rising gas prices would not plunge the country into an energy crisis, as ministers held a series of emergency meetings with energy companies and regulators to establish whether the nation could keep the lights and central heating on this winter.
A senior industry insider likened the meetings held between the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and energy industry leaders to the early crisis talks held following the outbreak of Covid-19.

Pep Guardiola admitted he felt “guilty” after Manchester City could only draw with Southampton, but remained defiant about his demand for more support at the Etihad.
City failed to score for only the second time in 41 home matches, but the fans inside an almost sold-out arena sang Guardiola’s name in the first half. After Wednesday’s 6-3 win over Leipzig, the City manager appealed to supporters to turn up in force for Saints’ visit, and received a blunt response from the general secretary of City’s official fan club.

Jonathan Van-Tam made the extraordinary proposal after months of uncertainty for the 19,000 volunteers who are effectively unable to travel to Europe to see family, work or go on holiday because they took part in trials of Novavax and Valneva.

It was a decade ago, before her father had become Philippine president, that Sara Duterte attracted national attention. A local sheriff had ignored orders issued by her, the mayor of Davao City, to delay the demolition of a shantytown. She arrived at the scene furious and punched him, not once, but four times in the head, in front of reporters.
Duterte, 43, a motorbike lover and tough talker, has a combative image that echoes that of her 76-year-old father, the populist president Rodrigo Duterte. It is widely believed that, as he nears the end of his six-year term limit, she will follow in his footsteps to Manila’s Malacañang Palace.

He doesn’t shout or sloganise. He talks in a learned manner about how the European Union has fallen for a Fukuyaman delusion that democracy is irreversible while all the time providing cover for the dismantling of democracy in Poland and Hungary.

                    <span>Major exhibition will reveal how neon went from the staple of brash advertising to an art form
Across two galleries in Wakefield sit more than half a dozen tubes of light at least two metres tall, revolving on the spot and creating ethereal shapes in the air. These sculptures, created by the pioneering American neon artist Fred Tschida, make up a dramatic new exhibition in the city called Circlesphere, which will open later this month.
The artwork is a rare example of what is now a dying craft, with only a handful of neon makers left in the UK. Along with trades like ladder making, slating and straw working, neon making is considered endangered and likely to die out altogether if urgent steps are not taken to preserve it, according to the Heritage Crafts Association (HCA). Daniel Carpenter, HCA operations director, said neon-making skills are a “small but significant part of British culture” that, if lost, would be “nearly impossible” to bring back.

Dozens of the world’s biggest brands, including Nike, Amazon, Ted Baker and Asos, have been advertising on websites that spread Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories, it has emerged. The companies, as well as an NHS service, are among a string of household names whose ads appear to have helped fund websites that host false and outlandish claims, for example that powerful people secretly engineered the pandemic, or that vaccines have caused thousands of deaths.
Analysis of nearly 60 sites, performed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and shared with the Observer, found that ads were placed through the “opaque” digital advertising market, which is forecast to be worth more than $455bn (£387bn) this year.

Allspice has been with me for ever. My mum used it in the kitchen, there was always allspice around. It was normally the whole berries, she would crush them herself. We didn’t have pestles and mortars in those days – it was the bottom of a heavy saucepan; Mum would roll her shoulders around and crush it up. Everything is in there: it gives you a hint of cinnamon, nutmeg, that pepper-y, clove-y taste, all of these different flavours out of this one berry.
Sometimes, late at night or if I’ve had it up to here with tea, I make a minty drink with a squirt of honey and allspice. I put it in my jackfruit and okra, butter bean, and pimento pot – it’s like a vegan Caribbean stew. I cook it down really slowly with coconut milk and ginger and thyme and everything else. Allspice warms it, gives it a little bit of a lift, a bit of movement in your mouth. I do chargrilled chicken and pineapple skewers with a slaw and I use the whole pimento berries to spice up the pickle for the slaw. The rule is, a bit of acidy stuff – a bit of lime or lemon or vinegar – really opens it up. I mix the ground allspice with pomegranate molasses too. There was a lovely dish that I did, lamb slow-cooked with olives and feta. It works great with Greek flavours.

In July, off the Turkish port city of Bodrum, Kerim Sabuncuoğlu stepped from the edge of a boat into the azure Aegean Sea and began to descend. A scuba diver with more than 30 years’ experience, he took up underwater photography in 2002 and has since devoted considerable amounts of time and money to his “out-of-control hobby” – capturing the wonders of the ocean on camera so that “the less fortunate people above” can also marvel at them.
Sabuncuoğlu has travelled the world, photographing marine life in Palau, Cuba and the Galápagos islands and winning several awards for his work. Closer to home in Bodrum, he was embarking on a standard dive with a group of friends, equipped with a Nikon D800 camera. The camera had an 85mm micro Nikkor lens and was clad in Nexus underwater housing, with a single Backscatter snoot to train light on the subject.

                    <span>High brow, low brow – for heaven’s sake, just pick up a book
In the latest tedious round of the culture war, I did not expect to be taking a position on the books of the new culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, whose defenders point to her being a prolific novelist as evidence of a sincere interest in the arts. Instantly, we are pitched into a world of literature “that people actually want to read”, defined against all those who think novels should be about feelings and Kierkegaard and preferably only understood by a coterie of four critics. Does anyone who likes books really think like this?
Dorries’s novels, which often feature nurses, Liverpool and Ireland, all of which reflect their author’s biography, tend to come in groups – the Lovely Lane series, the Tarabeg trilogy, the Four Streets series – and are produced at impressive speed. If people enjoy reading them, who am I to complain that they’re not exactly Thomas Mann? The answer is that snobbery in books, while often perceived to be top-down – de haut en bas, if you want to be posh about it – frequently seems to go in the other direction: though I’m perfectly happy for people to fill their boots with Dorries’s nurses, me losing myself in something long and weird and unpronounceable really gets on the anti-lit brigade’s nerves.

The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a weather watch for critical fire conditions in the Sequoia national park in the Sierra Nevada, where the Colony fire was burning about a mile from Giant Forest, a grove of 2,000 sequoias.

Tigers score five tries in front of bumper Welford Road crowd

There have been enough false dawns at Leicester in the last few years to urge a note of caution but the Welford Road faithful can be forgiven for getting carried away after a barnstorming victory over Exeter to begin the season. The Chiefs, last season’s runners-up and one of the dominant forces in England and Europe over the last few years, were sent packing with their tails between their legs. The Tigers scored five tries, ran roughshod over a team who have given them a few thrashings of late and have a burgeoning young star in the excellent full-back Freddie Steward.

                    <span>Lockdown was a productive time for Michael Craig-Martin: most of the works in his new show at Amsterdam’s Reflex gallery were created in its grip. He continued his longstanding project of painting everyday objects in minimal style, their clean lines and smooth surfaces reflecting the blandness at the heart of consumer culture. This time, among the Apple Watches, wheelie suitcases and noise-cancelling headphones, we find the true symbol of the Covid era: a face mask. “When we try to understand past civilisations – the stone age, ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Aztecs – we do so by examining the objects they created and used,” says Craig-Martin. “My work is like an archaeology of the present.”

                    <span>How I overcome my chronic insomnia with science
Everything about our day impacts our sleep. How many minutes we spend outside, what and when we eat, what’s happening with our hormones, our habits, emotions, stress and thoughts – all this feeds into the sleep we end up with at night. All of which I was completely oblivious to when battling chronic insomnia for years on end.
Sleep anxiety can create a very real and vicious circle. I would spend hours lying in bed, increasingly wired, anxious and exhausted as time ticked by, with prescription sleeping pills within reach for those 3am nights when I had to be up first thing. The problem is that the more we worry about sleep, the higher our stress hormones go – and too much of the stress hormone cortisol, whatever the trigger, disturbs our sleep. We’re left in a state of fight or flight, when we need to be in the opposite state of rest and digest. When my insomnia was at its worst, I’d start my day exhausted, running on empty, and have recurring burn-out days, where an overwhelming fatigue would stop me in my tracks, forcing me to lie down and recharge.

Every so often, TV and radio commissioners feel moved to explore the “state of the union”. They pick up a map, and a newspaper, look at them for a couple of seconds and wonder: “Whither the UK?” And how they unwhither their whithering is by asking someone they like (a comedian or in-favour presenter) to travel around parts of Great Britain in an unusual vehicle, such as a train, or to take a long hike along the coast, or to cycle about having chats with friendly locals. The underlying question is always the same: what exactly is the United Kingdom? What do Scotland, Wales and England have in common other than a shared seaside, some laws and a tendency to binge-drink? And, oh dearie me, what about Ireland?

                    <span>The Radio 1 presenter on student food, fighting with her brothers over fish eyes and her mum’s lockdown Nigerian food Zoom classes
My mum did Zoom masterclasses for the family in the pandemic. I hadn’t cooked Nigerian food before, ever. She’d send us the ingredients list early in the week, and then, wherever we were, we would cook and then eat together.. I learned all of these dishes that I probably should have learned growing up. I’m really excited to have dinner parties again, so I can actually exhibit my jollof rice.
It was survival of the fittest in our household. My three brothers are 6ft 7in and they eat so much. We used to have competitions around the dinner table. Like when you roast a chicken, we would take it in turns to see who could suck the spinal cord out in one go. And whoever could would be rewarded by getting the chicken feet. Which was a delicacy. If we were having a whole fish, we’d fight over the head. On I’m a Celeb they say, “Oh, you have to eat a fish eye,” and they’re all retching. In our household, we were fighting over the fish eyes!

Ali Kalora was one of two militants killed in the shootout, according to Central Sulawesi province’s military chief, Brig Gen Farid Makruf. He identified the other suspected extremist as Jaka Ramadan.

                    <span>Apple has just unveiled the latest all-singing, all-dancing iteration of its handset, but perhaps you should resist the hype
On Tuesday, Apple released its latest phone – the iPhone 13. Naturally, it was presented with the customary breathless excitement. It has a smaller notch (eh?), a redesigned camera, Apple’s latest A15 “bionic” chipset and a brighter, sharper screen. And, since we’re surfing the superlative wave, the A15 has nearly 15bn transistors and a “six-core CPU design with two high-performance and four high-efficiency cores”.
Wow! But just one question: why would I buy this Wundermaschine? After all, two years ago I got an iPhone 11, which has been more than adequate for my purposes. That replaced the iPhone 6 I bought in 2014 and that replaced the iPhone 4 I got in 2010. And all of those phones are still working fine. The oldest one serves as a family backup in case someone loses or breaks a phone, the iPhone 6 has become a hardworking video camera and my present phone may well see me out.

Winkleman, who is married with three children and lives in central London, also presents a weekly Radio 2 show, a hit podcast and last year published her debut book, Quite, a frank and funny guide to life.

I haven’t yet caught any of Jamie Oliver’s new Channel 4 series Together, in which he cooks the kind of stuff you can rustle up for groups of family and friends without experiencing a total nervous collapse. But I love its title, and not only because it makes me think of Lukas Moodysson’s 2000 film of the same name (the best movie about a Stockholm commune ever made). Few words are to me more lovely than together, and all the more so following months of painful, enforced separations. In the ear, its syllables seem to ring like an old-fashioned doorbell.
In the grind of lockdown, there were moments when the sight of my kitchen made me feel physically ill. My relationship with my fridge, in particular, began to be vaguely abusive: I was always slamming its door in a huff. No wonder, then, that the great opening up induced in me a state of ecstasy that could only end in near bankruptcy.

Only 2% of the population of developing countries have been inoculated, despite promises by rich nations. Ensuring the rest have access to vaccines would build trust with the poor world which is lacking, Miliband said, ahead of the vital UN Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow in November.

The late jazz great’s trio are captured in all their unplugged brilliance in this live recording from 2018
In the whole history of jazz, I can’t think of a piano, bass, drums trio that has played with such whole-hearted togetherness as Chick Corea’s Akoustic Band: Corea on piano with bassist John Patitucci and drummer Dave Weckl. All three were in Corea’s Elektric Band too, but the unplugged intimacy of the trio brings their music closer, revealing much fascinating detail. Corea died in February, aged 79, so this double album, from 2018, is presumably their last recording.
They’re all in terrific form here from the start, passing ideas around and apparently reading each other’s minds. It’s noticeable that, apart from Corea’s introductions, there’s very rarely an actual solo, when only one is playing. Instead, one instrument comes forward while the others put in comments and asides, often setting off a whole new chain of melodic ideas.

                    <span>Fintech firms are jostling to offer millennials interest-free payment plans as they shop online. Retailers love it of course, but all this unregulated lending is ringing alarm bells
Shoppers tempted by Boohoo’s bestselling satin skater dress are bombarded by options to pay for it using today’s hottest form of consumer credit – “buy now, pay later”.The fast-fashion website gives shoppers four ways to pay for the £30 dress in instalments: from three monthly payments of £10 with Klarna, to six weekly lots of £5 with Laybuy. Even those trying to buy it outright using a debit or credit card see reminders of “more ways to pay” flash up.
Once a niche form of credit, buy now, pay later (BNPL) deals have exploded during the pandemic. Labelled by some as “the future of millennial finance”, it has gained a foothold among the under-30s and those with tight finances, who have welcomed the ability to delay payment for goods, typically without interest. But it has also stoked fears that the unregulated financial product is encouraging unsustainable spending and reliance on debt.

Several hundred seabirds have been found dead along the coasts of north-east England and Scotland, while many have been discovered emaciated.
The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), which is investigating the cause of the deaths, said the majority of the birds were guillemots.

Imran Khan tweeted on Saturday that he took the initiative after his meetings this week in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, with leaders of countries neighbouring Afghanistan.

                    <span>Little wonder the actress rushed to distance herself from an ill-advised TV competition
Just when you think entertainment and celebrity culture cannot get any more surreal, it does. The last few days have seen: professional health officials in several countries feeling obliged to contradict a tweet by Nicki Minaj about her cousin’s friend’s swollen testicles; comedian Larry David being grumpy at unlikely public events; and “inventive” interpretations of the “American independence” theme at the Met Gala, from political slogans on backsides to Kim Kardashian’s head-to-toe black Balenciaga. (Her look reminded me of when the boys in my home town used to put black socks over their trainers to get past the bouncers at the local club, which had a strict shoes-only dress code.) After more than a year of lockdowns, and therefore limited opportunities to shine, famous people are putting themselves out there with gusto.
Nowhere has this chaotic energy been more apparent than in the saga of The Activist, which has been as compelling as a novel, albeit one that would be considered a bit too far-fetched. To recap, American television network CBS announced a new reality show called The Activist, which would pit six political activists against each other in a competition format, measuring their “successes” by online engagement, social media metrics and the judgments of the panel: noted grassroots organisers Julianne Hough, Priyanka Chopra and Usher. The final challenge, a showstopper, if you will, would have seen contestants lobbying at the forthcoming G20 in Rome.

The Mercury prize-winner showcases her tender debut album, Collapsed in Sunbeams, whose devastating lyrics paired with bland music cry out for the full force of her nine-strong band
Outside, night has fallen; inside, it’s still a summer’s day. This intimate venue is festooned with strings of plastic flowers hanging from the ceiling and wrapped around the mixing desk.
Blooms are very much in order because last week, the 21-year-old poet and singer Arlo Parks won the Mercury prize for her debut album, the widely feted Collapsed in Sunbeams, beating off arguably the strongest field of competitors in years: Sault, Celeste and Black Country, New Road, to name but three. Notably, seven out of 12 of the shortlisted artists this year were black – eight, if you count jazz legend Pharoah Sanders’s heady incursions on the collaborative album made by Floating Points with the London Symphony Orchestra. At a guess, Parks’s feeling of validation this week must be second only to that of fellow young British overachiever Emma Raducanu.

I think I still have the lizard brain of a 20-year-old. I wake up every morning and I have the same vision, the same perception – except when I start to move. The lag between my perception of how young I feel and that mobility… There’s a lag there.

The recall of the French ambassadors to Australia and the US – without precedent in two centuries of diplomacy between Paris and Washington – has plunged relations to depths unknown for decades.
Rifts over the Iraq war or Nato pale into insignificance. True, the French recalled their ambassador to Rome a couple of years ago, irked by the insults sent their way by the upstart Five Star leader Luigi di Maio, but that was a little warning to populists to stop encouraging the disruption of the yellow vest protests.

Soon after the April 2019 blaze, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the cathedral – which dates back to the 12th century – would be rebuilt. He later promised to reopen it to worshippers by 2024, when France hosts the Olympic Games.

Last February, Dr Bryce Meck, 30, would lock herself in the bathroom to cry for five minutes when her patients, whom she had watched over for weeks in the medical intensive care unit, were dying from Covid-19. They begged her to tell people in their community to get vaccinated. Of the 20 patients with Covid-19 in her care, only three survived.
Each week, Meck’s frustration grew when she saw patients in a Columbia, Missouri, primary care clinic. They expressed vaccine hesitancy, shared misinformation or told her that their friends were pressuring them to remain unvaccinated. “If only the patients in the clinic could just meet the people who are suffering in the hospital,” said Meck, who continues to experience long-term effects of the virus herself.

The semiconductor industry has a problem. Demand is booming for silicon chips, which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines, but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.
The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will, in part, rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles, solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant, or fab, can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.

Great Britain will field some of their strongest teams ever for the Road World Championships this coming week in Flanders. The squads are bursting with youthful talents such as the Olympic gold medallist Tom Pidcock and Pfeiffer Georgi, but such is the strength and the depth of the opposition in the elite events at least that their chances are all but impossible to predict.
The best medal hope lies with the 2015 women’s elite champion, Lizzie Deignan, as it has done for a decade now, apart from her break to give birth to her daughter, Orla. Deignan has yet to hit the heights she achieved in 2020; her only win to date is the Tour of Switzerland, but she now faces a busy end of the season, with the first women’s Paris-Roubaix and the UK Women’s Tour following immediately after Flanders.

I make damson cheese, jelly, jams, and eat them as they are, while here is a baked custard pie/brioche base hybrid that is a really fun thing for a dinner party. It’s low effort and maximum flavour.

Half-term holiday bookings have jumped by 200% compared with August since the government announced a relaxation of travel rules in England, the travel firm Thomas Cook has said.
On Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, unveiled plans to simplify the Covid rules around trips abroad from next month, scrapping the traffic light system and replacing it with a pared-down “red” list of countries from which arrivals will continue to be required to quarantine in a government-supervised hotel.

                    <span>After cancellation and postponement, the show returns next week. Late-season plants and flowers will take centre stage
Say what you like about the Chelsea flower show – expensive, crowded, a little superficial? – the Royal Horticultural Society’s annual spring fixture wields considerable influence over gardening trends. Before the pandemic, only two world wars suspended the event. Covid-19 not only cancelled Chelsea 2020, but this year booted the springtime institution into an entirely new season: autumn. That’s the horticultural equivalent of Wimbledon on ice. 
The RHS’s decision to postpone showtime until next week was made at the beginning of 2021, giving its designers only months to reimagine their long-proposed show gardens with late-performing blooms. Out with Chelsea staples such as primula, poppy, allium and iris, the surging greens and pastels that evoke the newness of spring; in with bolder tones, deepening leaves, hanging fruit and setting-seeds.

                    <span>Borlotti beans, caramelised squash and roast tomatoes make a satisfying, herby traybake
A few years back, my husband Hugh and I planted some borlotti beans and, although they grew, we’ve never managed to produce any since. We baked our small yield – three whole handfuls! – as per a Skye Gyngell recipe with sage, garlic and tomatoes, and loved it so much that we’ve since made the same sort of thing in lots of different ways, but without the fresh beans. We’ve tried every type of tinned bean there is, and added wine and squash, which braises beautifully in the stock. Today’s dish is an approximation of the recipe now scratched up in the Sodha family recipe book.

Charlie Brooker: ‘Succession made me furious with envy’
Modern Toss’s favourite Guide cartoons

To show how very long ago it was when I was given the “soap column” World of Lather for the Guide, I remember taking the news on a Nokia 5510, then dancing to a CD single of Independent Women, the red-hot new track by Destiny’s Child: “I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings,” I sang victoriously. I was giddy I was being offered actual cash to write about EastEnders, Corrie and Emmerdale – which were at that point getting 7 or 8 million viewers per episode. (Brookside was almost in its death throes.)

                    <span>Neil was an analogue artefact struggling to break through in an online world
So it’s farewell to Andrew Neil. While the former chairman and lead presenter of GB News had decades of print and television experience, it was clear from the start of his latest venture that he was an analogue artefact struggling to break through in an extremely online world. GB News was attempting to take the boundless anger and energy of rightwing posting and turn it into television. But Neil, to put it bluntly, is not a poster.
Despite the former BBC heavyweight’s assurances that the channel would not “slavishly follow the existing news agenda”, and would cover all areas of the country with the fairness and compassion to “reflect the views and values of our United Kingdom”, it seems that Neil’s attempt to revolutionise British broadcasting has fallen flat on its face. This may be because GB News was chasing an audience that doesn’t really exist – trying to combine traditional elements of prestige news (BBC veterans, experienced TV producers) with the furious viral pace of online woke-bashing. The hated metropolitan elite – also known as Neil’s friends and colleagues – lost interest pretty quickly when it was clear not many people were watching. But the audience for rightwing rage-posting doesn’t necessarily want an old-fashioned TV channel, especially one that can’t keep pace with the rapid cycles of increasingly unhinged conversation on YouTube and Twitter.

Even so, the past few days have been – as he puts it, with a degree of understatement – “an odd experience”.

                    <span>Since its creation in late 1988, the Guardian’s Saturday supplement has been lauded for front covers and features that have caught the eye and sparked joy or sometimes controversy. As its final edition is published, some of the team who worked on it explain how they brought the magazine to life 
In 1988, Guardian editor Peter Preston was feeling jealous. The recently launched Independent had a new supplement on Saturday. Edited by the late Alexander Chancellor, it was shot artfully in black and white, and was receiving praise for its inventive use of photography. Meanwhile, the Guardian had barely any feature writers; interviews usually ended up buried in the middle of the paper.
“Saturday had traditionally been the weakest day of the week in terms of circulation,” says former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger who was, at the time, the parliamentary sketch writer. “The Guardian had experimented with some not very successful newsprint sections – one called Friday had flopped. The Independent had broken the mould with their magazine and it had given them a massive boost in circulation. Something had to be done.”

                    <span>It takes a band of global talents to create Yotam Ottolenghi’s distinctive dishes. In an exclusive extract from his latest book, he introduces some of their finest new creations


Originally located under a railway arch in north London, built from equal parts brick and tahini, walls coated in olive oil and floors stained with spice, the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen started off simply as the place where I play with my food; my low-tech lab where ideas turn into dishes, which turn into recipes. Gradually, though, like a sourdough starter, it began to absorb outside “contaminators”, gathering fizz and bubbles and a load of funk, until finally it became rich, deep and splendidly distinct.
The OTK crew are the equivalent of a good loaf’s life-affirming natural yeasts. Through them, my food, rooted in Jerusalem and the Middle East, has become our food, having been on all kinds of journeys, borrowing harissa from north Africa and chaat masala from India, using newly discovered chilli pastes from south-east Asia or Mexico, and adopting some cheffy techniques from our London restaurants.

Sam Bates* was excluded from school for the first time when he was five years old. After moving into year 1, he struggled to sit still, became frustrated with staff and pushed chairs over. He was sent home for one day and was then allowed back for only two hours a day, separated from his classmates, with a teaching assistant. From there, things unravelled.
“That went on for seven months, the two hours a day,” says Amanda Bates*, his mother, based in the east of England. “It really didn’t work.” She asked if Sam could go back but repeat a year, as he was young for his year group, but this was refused. Instead the school applied for the local authority’s “specialist resource space”, an alternative to mainstream school. “But there was a huge waiting list and they wouldn’t take him,” says Bates.

                    <span>Europe’s captain accepts the outcome of next week’s Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits will have an impact on his golfing legacy
It has never been wise to mistake the eccentric side of Pádraig Harrington for an overarching trait. Harrington is far more intelligent, sagacious and tough than is apparent when he displays a quirky side. A career that has delivered three major championships among more than 30 professional victories means Harrington is widely regarded as the Republic of Ireland’s greatest sportsman. This is not the domain of a clown.
There is now vulnerability. The 50-year-old Harrington will lead Europe into next weekend’s Ryder Cup with the sense – and fear – that his reputation is on the line. “There are very few things that can affect my golfing legacy,” he explains. “If I win another tournament, it doesn’t make much difference. It’s even questionable whether winning another major would. The Ryder Cup impacts my legacy. My ego is attached to my golf and there is no question the Ryder Cup will have an effect on that. Being a losing captain could definitely have an effect on who I feel I am. That’s something that would have to be dealt with.

His stroke could have been prevented by relatively inexpensive medication for a blood clotting condition that, as a refused asylum seeker, he was not entitled to on the NHS.

A week before the opening of the UK’s most prestigious flower show, the site is full of JCBs and people in hi-vis vests with steel-capped boots. Some gardens still look like construction sites, including part of the RHS Cop26 Garden – except that this one is finished.
Drainpipes, a manhole chamber, old concrete and industrial offcuts lie strewn around. “When I told people we were taking this stuff to Chelsea they thought we were fly-tipping,” says Marie-Louise Agius from landscaping company Balston Agius, who designed the garden. It has taken 12 people three weeks to put together.

Campaigners against anti-Catholic bigotry and anti-Irish discrimination will gather in protest around vulnerable churches on Saturday, as Glasgow braces itself for the largest gathering of Orange marchers since the pandemic.
More than 30 of the controversial Protestant parades will converge in the city centre to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the first Battle of the Boyne parade, with potential turnout estimated from 5,000 to 13,000. Hundreds of police officers are expected to be deployed on the day, with 32 streets closed until mid-afternoon to facilitate the marchers.

                    <span>As NHS waiting lists reach record levels, more and more patients are paying for ops out of their own pockets

Britons without health insurance on why they paid to go private


When Fabien needed to have a decayed tooth removed in May, his dentist told him that he would have to wait up to three years to have it done on the NHS. In disbelief, the 27-year-old from Edinburgh rang 50 dental practices but without any luck. He had no choice but to go private. Having lost his job during the pandemic, he was on universal credit and had to borrow the £600 from his family.
Fabien is one of a growing number of people without health insurance who are paying for medical treatments out of their own pocket. NHS hospital waiting lists in England have reached record levels, hitting 5.6 million this summer, as doctors struggle to clear a growing backlog caused by Covid-19. People on modest incomes, and even those claiming benefits are turning to private providers for knee or hip replacements, cataract removal or even expensive cancer treatment.

Private hospitals profit from NHS waiting lists

Spire Healthcare, one of Britain’s leading private hospital operators, has returned to profit after a surge in patients choosing to pay for hip and knee operations. Long waiting lists on the NHS have resulted in more people paying for healthcare themselves.
We spoke to three people without health insurance who sought consultations and treatments privately.

“The situation here is chaos,” says Sayed*, an Afghan interpreter who worked for the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). “People are scared, and all the banks are closed, people in desperate situations, running out of money. Food and other things are getting expensive. How do you describe it – it’s so dark. People are in so dire a situation.”

The multimillionaire New York real estate heir Robert Durst has been convicted of murdering his best friend Susan Berman more than 20 years ago, in a case that took on new life following the documentary The Jinx.
Durst was found guilty of first degree murder on Friday after a jury in Los Angeles deliberated for about seven hours over three days. Berman was shot at point-blank range in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000 as she was prepared to tell police how she helped cover up the killing of Durst’s wife.

Teenage passion meets Nazi ideology in Bess Wohl’s play, inspired by a real-life summer camp in the US
It is 1938 and two American teenagers are at a themed summer camp on Long Island that is led by Nazi ideology. However much this may feel like a Truman Show-type of alternate reality, Bess Wohl’s two-hander is inspired by the real-life history of the German American Bund, which in the 1930s set up camps across the US in support of the Third Reich.
For these teens at Camp Siegfried, known only as Her (Patsy Ferran) and Him (Luke Thallon), it is as much a summer of love as an indoctrination camp, although the pressure is on to “be social” – which means pairing up and procreating in order to spawn a race of German purebloods.

The crisis engulfing Evergrande, China’s second-biggest property company, is the greatest test yet of President Xi Jinping’s effort to reform the debt-ridden behemoths of the Chinese economy. It could also be the most significant test that China’s financial system has faced in many years.
As angry protesters occupied the headquarters of the troubled property developer in recent weeks, some analysts have described the Evergrande crisis as “China’s Lehman Brothers moment”. Only this time it’s a credit-fuelled housebuilder that suddenly can’t pay its $300bn debts, rather than a blue-chip investment bank that many assumed was too big to fail but was instead thrown to the wolves 13 years ago.

ESPN Brasil reported on Friday that Pelé was readmitted to the ICU due to acid reflux. The 80-year-old had a colon tumour removed this month and stayed in the hospital for further monitoring.

                    <span>First time France has recalled a US ambassador in alliance dating back to American revolution
France has recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia for consultations sparked by the “exceptional seriousness” of Canberra’s surprise decision to cancel an order for French-built submarines and its security pact with Washington and London.
The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the order to bring the ambassadors back to Paris “immediately” was made at the request of the French president, Emmanuel Macron.

A US drone strike in Afghanistan last month killed 10 civilians – including seven children – and not an Islamic State extremist as first claimed, the Pentagon has admitted.
In a briefing on Friday, the commander of US Central Command, Gen Kenneth McKenzie, said he now believes it was unlikely that those who died were Islamic State militants or posed a direct threat to US forces at Kabul’s airport.

                    <span>At times it seemed as if Allan Saint-Maximin was taking Leeds on almost single-handedly and, tellingly, the struggle was often far from unequal.
Without their attacking talisman to, once again, ride to the rescue, Newcastle would surely have been well beaten in a wonderful, thrill a minute, match full of audacious creative improvisation and sometimes kamikaze defending. Instead Saint-Maximin’s stellar equaliser secured their unloved manager, Steve Bruce, a draw.

Lozowski kicks seven penalties in ominous display

So much for new horizons. This was the same old Saracens – suffocating, stifling and ultimately supremely successful. On their return to the Premiership after a season of shame in the second tier they ground Bristol down before breaking their spirit to give the rest of the league a reminder of just how bloody-minded they can be. That it came without the razzle-dazzle that marked the climax to last season’s Premiership will not bother them in the slightest. In fact, they will relish it.
That they did so in front of more than 19,000 supporters – the biggest UK rugby crowd for 18 months – will make their manner of victory all the sweeter and their statement all the louder. The fact that they made it when missing so many star names is all the more ominous for their rivals.

The audience wears headphones for Curious Directive’s complex new production, which takes us into a school – and a network of caves in Indonesia
There is layer upon layer to Curious Directive’s new work, which excavates the past – and takes us deep down into a network of caves in Indonesia – in order to illuminate our present. It’s an impressively intricate show, created in collaboration with Indonesian artist collective Bombo, whose video footage of the local caves and landscape lights up the show. But for all its complexity, Deciphering is essentially a love letter to learning, brimming with curiosity and suffused with a childish sense of wonder.
At the centre of these crisscrossing layers is Elise, played by three different actors at three different life stages. Young Elise occupies the central stage space: a colourful and cluttered school in Indonesia, where Scottish teacher Mr Robins will inspire a lifelong passion for learning. Above the stage – in Zoë Hurwitz’s packed but nimble set – is a jumble of scaffolding where twentysomething Elise prowls restlessly, unsure of where to land. And deep below the stage lies a dark cave, where a middle-aged Elise will eventually discover a scientific marvel, as well as a part of herself she thought had disappeared for good.

World Cup qualifying campaign begins with one-sided thrashing

New manager Sarina Wiegman cautioned that her team “need some opponents that are of a higher standard than tonight” after her tenure, and England’s World Cup 2023 qualifying campaign, began ruthlessly against an exhausted North Macedonia at St Mary’s.
“We only learned [from tonight] in an attacking way,” she said. “Against a top-ranking team it’s going to be different. What we know is we need to finish better than we did today. We can be a little bit more composed, more connected, those little things. So we can learn from that and bring it to a higher level, so that even against a better opponent, we can score too.”

                    <span>With Firebird, her first original album in more than a decade, Imbruglia reflects on the highs and lows of her career – and the new crop of artists she inspired
Natalie Imbruglia is not afraid to talk about the lowest point of her career. “Oh yeah, I quit. Effectively, in my head, I wasn’t going back to music,” she says. She’s speaking to Guardian Australia over Zoom from her home in Oxfordshire in England. It’s early morning and her camera is switched off because, by her own description, she “looks like death”.
Imbruglia was just 16 in 1992 when she was cast as Beth Brennan on Neighbours. But if her name is familiar to you, it’s more likely because of Torn: a cover of a 1995 song by US band Ednaswap that turned Imbruglia into a global pop sensation two years later.

                    <span>The Matrix is returning! But how much do you remember about the original films? Take our quiz to find out how plugged-in you really are
The Matrix is more than a blockbuster movie franchise, more than a cultural touchstone, more than an epic sizzle reel for philosophical speeches delivered by a dude in a trenchcoat with nose-clip sunglasses. With the first instalment arriving in 1999, positioned at the edge of the good old 90s and the impending doom of the 21st century, The Matrix became a credible(ish) way of explaining the universe (pre-empting the simulation theory, which arrived soon after) and even spawned its own quasi-religion, “Matrixism”.
Written and directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski, much of the original trilogy was filmed in a computer simulation known as Australia: not the most advanced program in the world, but it did the job. With the trailer for the belated fourth instalment, The Matrix Resurrections, having arrived last week ahead of the film’s release in Australian cinemas on 1 January, the world is poised to once again see through the veneer of existence and accept that our lives are merely bits of code engineered by aliens.

Just two weeks before France complained of being “stabbed in the back”, two senior French ministers met with their Australian counterparts, Marise Payne and Peter Dutton, for what was meant to be a sign of ever-strengthening ties between the two countries.
The joint statement they issued now seems extraordinary, given the events that followed. “Both sides committed to deepen defence industry cooperation and enhance their capability edge in the region,” they said. “Ministers underlined the importance of the future submarine program.”

“There is no shortcut in India,” Ravi Shastri says with a wry smile on a cool September morning in London. All the heat and dust of this summer’s series between England and India, which was as riveting as it was controversial, has drifted away. Even Shastri, India’s coach at the centre of the furore which followed the postponement of the fifth Test at Old Trafford last week, has found time for a reflective breather before confirming here that he will step down after the T20 World Cup in November.
“They’re not bothered if there is Covid or not. They just want you to win, and score runs,” Shastri says of cricketing fervour in India. “You know, being the coach of India is like being the football coach of Brazil or England. There’s always this gun pointing at you. Always. You might have six great months and then you get out for 36 and they will shoot you. Then you have to win immediately. Otherwise they will eat into you, right through. You need a hide like mine, absolutely like leather, so it doesn’t make a difference.”

Predator versus predator. There will be a strong temptation when Spurs and Chelsea walk out at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday afternoon to view the latest instalment of this edgy, at times rather sour London rivalry through the prism of Rom and Harry.
It is a natural comparison, a meeting of 28-year-old alpha-dog centre-forwards whose careers have converged without ever quite intersecting, a decade-long dance at one remove. As long ago as 2010 Tottenham were trying to sign the 17-year-old Romelu Lukaku of Anderlecht, already a darling of European football and a player who seemed on a different trajectory from the more homespun Harry Kane, who was at that moment getting ready to shuffle off on loan to Leyton Orient.

                    <span>Delivering this year’s HG Wells lecture, the author of 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World celebrates the late science fiction author’s dedication to fighting inequality
The first time I got my hands on a book written by HG Wells, I was a student in Turkey. I found an old edition in an arcade of little secondhand shops that I visited often to buy novels and fanzines, and to check the latest heavy metal albums. Its cover stained by damp, its pages slightly tattered, the book showed signs of previous ownership. The First Humans in the Moon, the title read. Later, I would discover that the Turkish translation was gender neutral but that the original, The First Men in the Moon, wasn’t.
At the time, I was not much interested in science fiction. I had purchased the book because it had intrigued me for a reason I could not quite comprehend. But reading it was not a priority. Back then, I was enamoured with Russian literature; Gogol’s Dead Souls and Dostoevsky’s Notes from a Dead House and The Brothers Karamazov had permanently shifted something within me. I wanted to read the kind of literature that dealt with what I saw as “the harsh socio-political realities”. Hence, I underestimated and ignored HG Wells, and his novel remained on my shelf unread and unloved for a long, long while.

                    <span>Pitlochry Festival theatre
Lesley Orr and Jo Clifford’s show about the lives of some who have died in the past 18 months is a necessary act of communal remembrance
We’ve read about it in the papers. We’ve seen it analysed on TV. We’ve chatted about it in Zoom meetings. But it’s only now, after 18 months, that we can give voice to our experience of Covid-19 in the company of others. For many people, the pandemic dealt a triple blow. It took away their loved ones, it prevented them being present when they were most needed, and it denied them the chance to grieve in public.
The Covid Requiem is a chance to catch up. Written and performed by Lesley Orr and Jo Clifford, it is a simple show, more eulogy than theatre. It needn’t be anything more. Just to express what we have been through seems enough. Yes, we know of the loss, the courage, the selflessness, the opportunism and the errors, but to hear those things spoken to an audience – or do I mean congregation? – feels like a necessary civic act.

The Taliban have effectively banned girls from secondary education in Afghanistan, by ordering high schools to re-open only for boys.
Girls were not mentioned in Friday’s announcement, which means boys will be back at their desks next week after a one-month hiatus, while their sisters will still be stuck at home.

Senior scientific advisers have publicly accused the government of sidelining behavioural experts and appearing unwilling to listen to “uncomfortable truths” on vaccine passports and masks during the pandemic.
The scientists told the Guardian that their input to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) was apparently no longer wanted owing to the expansion of in-house expertise.

The new livestreamed production from Rambert2 is both sensual and unnerving with a compelling central performance
For some dance companies during the pandemic, streamed shows were just a stopgap, but Rambert thinks differently. Artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer clearly saw the opportunity in this new platform and continues to make livestreamed work, conceptualised for the camera.
Rambert2 is a collection of some of the world’s most impressive dance graduates, so it’s unexpected that this latest work, Note to Self, is about the concerns not of youth but of ageing. And while it does showcase the zinging talents of the young recruits very well, the centre of the film is an older woman, Eve, played by actor Karlina Grace-Paṣeda. We meet her sitting in her living room, surrounded by Post-its reminding her to water the plants. Her memory is failing.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Half-term holiday bookings are expected to surge after ministers unveiled a simplification of Covid foreign travel rules, replacing the traffic-light system with a single red list and bringing in a laxer regime for tests.
But while MPs and some travel groups welcomed the new system, airlines voiced anger that fully vaccinated travellers returning to England will still have to take a test after they return, even if this will be changed to a cheaper lateral flow version.

Muhammad Jalloh and David Ture, both 19 and of no fixed address, as well as 23-year-old Vagnei Colubali from Cambridge were found guilty of David Gomoh’s murder in August. Alex Melaku, who could not previously be named as he was younger than 18, was also convicted.

Britain’s pig farmers are the latest casualty of the worsening energy crisis which threatens to trigger a shortage of carbon dioxide used across the food and drinks industry.
Rocketing gas prices have caused a Europe-wide slowdown for some chemical factories that produce fertiliser, a byproduct of which is carbon dioxide, used in fizzy drinks and beer as well as in the meat industry to stun animals before slaughter.

                    <span>Boris Johnson’s record of incompetence and dishonesty has given Sir Ed Davey an opportunity

Electoral history is full of upsets, but few are as stunning as the Liberal Democrats’ byelection victory in Chesham and Amersham, deep in the heart of Tory Britain. In June there was a 25% swing against the ruling party and a study by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank this week calculated that more than 30 Tory MPs would be vulnerable if such a revolt were repeated. With their party conference starting on Friday, the Liberal Democrats are determined to make that win just the first step in bringing down the Conservatives’ “blue wall”.
While there are causes for optimism, one ought to be realistic. The Lib Dems have 12 MPs. Sir Ed Davey is the party’s fourth leader in six years. He will not be telling delegates this weekend to go back to their constituencies and “prepare for government”. But there are good reasons to believe something is happening. The local election results in May signalled Lib Dem gains at the expense of the Conservatives.

                    <span>Though the days turn cold and the night draws in, we should not mourn; this time of year is full of richnesses and new beginnings too
 
So, after a late short blaze of summer, autumn is here. The leaves are turning, the blackberries are mostly eaten. So much of our approach to the season in literature and music has a dying fall: “Nothing gold can stay”, as Robert Frost put it. Not that summer was especially golden in the UK this year. Many, deprived of the long warm days of beach-going and picnics they had hoped for, feel it never happened at all. And now there is a rising drumroll of warning about winter infection rates, NHS overwhelm and rocketing heating costs.
True, the swifts are leaving, and geese honk across the sky. The mornings are darker and evenings shorter – one definition of autumn is that it begins on the equinox, 21 September, when dark and light are equal; another is based on average temperature, and kicks the season off on 1 September – but a flock of swallows waiting for the signal to go is a wonderful thing. And other birds, including knots, waxwings, fieldfares, light-bellied brent geese and redwings are just arriving.

Labour sources said the need to transform the economy to meet the climate challenge and create green jobs in the UK would be a key theme in Starmer’s conference speech, and in a lengthy essay for the Fabian Society he is due to publish in the run-up to the conference in Brighton.

A legal challenge has been launched over the government’s apparent attempt to force the charities’ watchdog to pursue a regulatory agenda against good causes that ministers believe stray into “woke” and “political” activities.
The Good Law Project has served a pre-action letter claiming ministers’ stated intention is to make it a condition of appointment that the new chair of the Charity Commission in effect pursues “the current political agenda of the Tory party”.

A coroner is to write to a police force about a nine-year-old boy who was mauled to death by a dog during a Cornish holiday, after his inquest heard the animal had been involved in previous attacks.
Frankie MacRitchie was killed after being left alone in a caravan with the 45kg dog, called Winston, an American bulldog crossed with a staffordshire bull terrier.

You may have heard talk of Gary Neville as a future mayor of Manchester. But what about Marcus Rashford and Gareth Southgate as saviours of the union, the two of them combining to win a trophy larger than any sporting bauble: namely, the preservation of the United Kingdom itself?
The notion comes from none other than Gordon Brown, who this week unveiled new research to confound the view that the nations of the UK are steadily pulling apart. Brown released polling data showing that, on what the former prime minister calls the “Southgate values” of diversity, tolerance and equality, the people of England not only agree with the coach of the national team, they are in statistical harmony with voters in Wales and Scotland too.

The US and the EU made a joint pledge on Friday to cut global methane emissions by almost a third in the next decade, in what climate experts hailed as one of the most significant steps yet towards fulfilling the Paris climate agreement.
The pledge came as the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, warned of a “high risk of failure” at the vital UN climate talks, Cop26, set for Glasgow this November.

Coronavirus infection levels have risen in schoolchildren in England, data has revealed, with more than one in 37 of those in years 7 to 11 estimated to have had Covid last week.
Experts say the findings could be linked to the return of schools after the summer break. In England many schools returned on 1 September, or the day after.

Boris Johnson will fly to New York this weekend for his first foreign trip since the Covid pandemic, hoping to cement his relationship with the US president, Joe Biden, after a rocky summer marred by the chaotic Kabul airlift.
Two years ago, when Johnson made his first foreign trip as prime minister to the Biarritz G7 summit, the hope was that Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for the man he called “Britain Trump” would help smooth the way for a rapid post-Brexit trade deal with the US.

                    <span>The latest cabinet sackings and appointments reveal the prime minister’s lack of courage and leadership, writes John Robinson, while John Cookson says they are merely part of a plan for an early election. Plus letters from Dave Pollard, Mick Beeby and David Redshaw
Boris Johnson has long yearned to be the modern-day Winston Churchill, famed for his oratory and leadership just as his hero was during and after the second world war. But leadership takes both courage and conviction, as well as the ability to do what is necessary, regardless of personal cost. We haven’t seen anything like that during Johnson’s premiership to date – this reshuffle has been perhaps his last chance to show that he can be a leader of sorts (Boris Johnson lays groundwork for general election with ruthless reshuffle, 15 September).
Sacking Gavin Williamson required no courage. Failing to sack Priti Patel showed an inability to do what was necessary, given her failure to deal with the UK border issues and her serial breaking of the ministerial code. The shambolic evacuation of Afghanistan, managed by the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, merited only a demotion, one mitigated by the gift of those two grandiose titles – lord chancellor and deputy prime minister. Hardly an indicator of prime ministerial conviction.

Vincent had been in London for a landmark high court ruling which ordered the Environment Agency to do more to protect five-year-old Mathew Richards from the landfill’s hydrogen sulphide fumes, which doctors said were shortening his life expectancy.

Bravo, George Monbiot (England’s right-to-build laws are tokenistic and feeble – just ask the people of Totnes, 15 September). The warm words in the National Planning Policy Framework – “planning policies and decisions should be responsive to local circumstances and support housing developments that reflect local needs” – are trumped by the cold reality of market forces and the government, in a bid to build us out of Covid.
Monbiot’s conclusion that planning laws in general, and the Community Right to Build in particular, are “tokenistic and feeble” is borne out in the prime minister’s proposals to simplify the planning system, in which two of the three intended zones are pro-development. Basically, it’s a builders’ charter, with faint recognition of the need for affordable homes.

                    <span>Analysis: new cabinet includes more rightwingers and longstanding backers of the PM

Who’s in, who’s out

Boris Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle has included the promotion of culture warriors, more rightwingers and a string of his Brexiter “mates”, but his supporters claim the shake-up was more about getting key fixers in place to deliver policy before the next election.
Tory insiders point to the promotion of Nadine Dorries – a friend of Johnson’s wife, Carrie – to culture secretary and Kemi Badenoch to minister of state as a sign that culture warriors are in the ascendancy in government. The new-look cabinet also includes four more Brexiters than before, with big jobs for Dorries, Anne-Marie Trevelyan as trade secretary, Nadhim Zahawi as education secretary, and Simon Clarke as chief secretary to the Treasury.

It’s hard not to wonder, when reading Nadine Dorries’ novels, whether the newly anointed culture secretary keeps a checklist of cliches about the Irish beside her as she writes. One character even says: “No one in their right mind ever had a bad word to say about a potato.” Jesus, Mary and Joseph, as a Dorries protagonist would say. And in fact does.
Another has “vivid, twinkling blue eyes, the kind that can only come from Irish roots”. A third “embodied everything everyone knows to be true of an Irishman. He was as bold as brass, full of the blarney and didn’t know the meaning of the word shy.” Men knock back the Guinness (28 mentions in The Four Streets, Dorries’ first book), while they dream of “green fields the colour of emeralds, or a raven-haired girl, with eyes that shone like diamonds”, and kick each other’s heads in. “It was the Irish way. Fists and boots first, words later.”

From brutal conflicts to periods of prosperity, pandemics to triumphs for equality, human history is full of highs and lows. But such fluctuations don’t just affect society: the human body can also be a sign of the times.
Studies have shown that our height is not just a matter of genetics but is also influenced by the environment we live in, with key factors including our nutrition and experience of sickness, such as diarrhoea.

From the 1,430-mile (2,300km) Great Barrier Reef in Australia to the Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean, coral reefs and the diversity of fish species they support are in steep decline, a trend that is projected to continue as the planet continues to heat in the 21st century.

                    <span>The deal has upset China, but it also binds the US into European security, in a world where Nato may be less relevant
France is furious. Theresa May is worried. The announcement of the new Australia-UK-US alliance (Aukus) and the ditching of a previous French-Australian submarine deal has led France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, to term the pact “a stab in the back”, while the former British prime minister is concerned about Britain being dragged into a war over the future of Taiwan.
Oddly enough, Beijing’s reaction has been rather muted. Yes, it has accused the west of a “cold war mentality”, and Xi Jinping has warned foreigners not to interfere in the region, but its warning that China would “closely monitor the situation” was close to a “cut and paste” outrage.

The court of appeal has overturned a controversial judgment that children under the age of 16 considering gender reassignment are unlikely to be mature enough to give informed consent to be prescribed puberty-blocking drugs.
Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust, which runs NHS England’s only gender identity development service (GIDS) for children, challenged a high court ruling last year in a case brought against the service by Keira Bell, a 24-year-old woman who began taking puberty blockers when she was 16 before detransitioning. The other applicant was the unnamed mother of a teenage autistic girl on the waiting list for treatment.

Sir Clive Sinclair, who has died aged 81 from cancer, was the inventor who brought pocket calculators and the earliest cheap and accessible miniature computers into British homes in the 1980s.
For a few years he seemed to be the epitome of the new hi-tech, go-ahead Britain the Tory government was striving to promote. He was made businessman of the year, knighted, championed by Margaret Thatcher and became, briefly, a multimillionaire. But, proving a better inventor and self-publicist than an entrepreneur, his reputation came a cropper in 1985 with the invention of the C5, his prototype electric car.

The female Soviet chess champion Nona Gaprindashvili is suing Netflix for $5m for a line in its hit series The Queen’s Gambit that claimed she “never played men”, calling the assertion “grossly sexist and belittling”.
The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in the federal district court in Los Angeles, attempts to set the record straight in the fictional account of Beth Harmon, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who travels to Moscow for a series of chess matches against Soviet champions.

I am 31. Three years ago, I fell into a relationship with a woman who was 50. We lied about our ages (I said I was 35 and she said 45). What started off as a casual encounter has evolved into a relationship that isn’t exactly conventional. I don’t know many people who have been able to sustain a relationship with this big an age gap. My friends are all finding their partners, marrying and having kids, while I am still casually dating someone who is older than my mum.
The other problem is that she is married. She and her ex are separated and due to divorce at some point. It’s been a source of frustration that this woman, whom I love dearly, has the security of a home, living rent- and bill-free, while I work and pay for myself like most people my age. She also has children closer to me in age. I have never met them, thanks to embarrassment on her part and reluctance on mine. Her friends are in their 50s and 60s, while mine are in their 20s and 30s.

Insulate Britain staged its first protest on Monday and has since brought large sections of the UK’s busiest motorway to a standstill to demand action to tackle the escalating climate emergency.

A huge week for the Westminster village and its many idiots, then, as Boris Johnson finally got around to shuffling his cabinet. It’s always a thrill to see one’s ministerial bestiary gain some new entries – and, indeed, to rip out a few of its pages as certain featured creatures are deemed either too grotesque or cautionary to retain their spots.
We’ll start with the “in memoriam” reel. The media minister, John Whittingdale, was treated brutally, which he’d at least have enjoyed. Robert Buckland’s culling was unexpected, with the now former justice secretary and lord chancellor finding out at the same time as everyone else that he was about as highly rated as an Airbnb with pubic hair in the soap and claw marks in the cellar.

England’s coronavirus testing strategy has been been criticised as “reckless” amid plans to end the free provision of rapid tests and relax the monitoring of cases from abroad.
Families and businesses will have to pay for lateral flow tests from next year in an overhaul of Downing Street’s approach to the pandemic.

Why does world’s tallest populace seem to be getting shorter?

It is, perhaps, with just a hint of satisfaction that the Dutch office for national statistics has confirmed that the men and women of the Netherlands remain the tallest people on the planet. But the government’s statisticians have had cause to report a further potentially humbling twist: the Dutch are shrinking.
For the last six decades, the people of the lowlands have stood imperiously at the top of the world height league table, with the latest data suggesting the average 19-year-old man stood at just over 6ft tall (182.9cm) in 2020, while women born in the same year measured in at 5ft 6 in (169.3cm).

She also claimed the Republicans had been hijacked by a cult that believed neither in science or government, making it hard for the US to be governed.

I keep reading that we decline in our 70s so I try to keep using my brain. Discovering new music opens my mind and the element of surprise keeps me connected. I feel like I’m mining for diamonds – and when you find the diamond, you know. When I heard Chaise Longue by Wet Leg I got really excited: it’s cheeky, with a wicked groove, but it’s the vocals – they’re almost metronomic. You could ask 100 people to sing it and it wouldn’t sound the same.

Welcome to my final Weekend column, guys. I was debating how emotional to get on this one. I have spent the last couple of days listening to Kanye West’s new album, so I am in quite a depressive mood. This column is my Donda.
Two years ago, I was tasked with writing in this slot. And every week I smashed out 600 words for your delectation, all about my ongoing road to self-improvement. There was the aim to spend less time on my phone, which has worked so effectively that I have already checked it twice since starting this article. There was learning how to DJ, which hasn’t progressed at all – and now I have a gig in October where I am expected to mix (I might end up being the first DJ outed for miming). And of course who could forget the year of weight loss and fitness training that led to a set of before and after photos that were essentially identical? That was the initial remit, at least. Some weeks, I would have a fully formed idea drop into my head, I would sit at my laptop for 45 minutes or so, and it would be done, and I would be happy. Other weeks, I would agonise over it, adding a sentence at a time, before eventually sending in a column with a covering apology and an offer to rewrite it completely.

                    <span>For my final column, my biggest lesson yet: there is no model, there is only trying
When I was a child, I longed to be an adult. For my 10th birthday, I demanded a cake in the shape of a 10, delighted to be an age that was two digits rather than one. Adults had freedom to do what they wanted; not like me who could barely snaffle a biscuit without someone noticing. I was always being told “be good, do well, make us proud” and not what I wanted (ie to play Tomb Raider, and have crushes on fictional teen characters played by weirdly older actors).
When I started this column, documenting my journey to a happy adulthood, I knew that the traditional trappings (house, kids, pension; freedom achieved by financial security) were slipping out of reach for my generation. I searched for another model. That four-year journey covered driving lessons, pet parenthood, broken friendships, emotional burn-out – and that’s before the pandemic.

Pep Guardiola has told Kevin Parker, the general secretary of Manchester City’s supporters’ club, to “review” his comments after Wednesday’s win over RB Leipzig, with the manager refusing to apologise for his remarks.
After City’s 6-3 victory in the opening Champions League group match, Guardiola said his players were tired and he would like “more people” to come for Saturday’s visit of Southampton than the 38,062 who attended the Leipzig game at the Etihad Stadium, which holds just under 54,000.

                    <span>Nine sea turtles hatch on beach in Jesolo, Veneto, in what scientists describe as ‘exceptional’ event
Eggs that were laid on a sandy beach in northern Italy by a loggerhead sea turtle, or Caretta Caretta, have hatched in what scientists describe as an “exceptional” event possibly brought on by global heating. It was the first time that the hatching of Caretta Caretta sea turtle eggs had been recorded along the northern Adriatic coast.
Nine sea turtles were born on Wednesday night on the beach in Jesolo, a popular seaside resort close to Venice where their mother had deposited 82 eggs, about 25 metres from the sea, overnight on 9 July.

For 20 years, I have been dressing up every week in the look I write about in this column. Today I’m in a shacket, of which more later. I’ve road-tested boilersuits and blouses, prairie collars and pencil skirts. I’ve shoulder-robed, I’ve clutched, I’ve French-tucked, and I’ve worn every hemline – well, so long as it is knee-length or longer, that is. (Funnily enough, I have never in all this time felt compelled to share here my thoughts on bikinis.)
Every week, for 20 years. I won’t do the maths because it makes me feel ancient, but I think you’ll agree that it is time to switch things up a little. So the shacket is my swansong, as it were. I’ll still be here, writing about fashion and style, but I won’t be doing the show-and-tell photograph.

                    <span>The affordability of Sinclair’s revolutionary 1982 home computer let a generation of young bedroom coders make anarchic, punky games, and its hardware limitations merely fostered extra creativity
• Clive Sinclair dies aged 81 – report
One day, in the bitterly cold autumn of 1981, my dad brought something home with him which he said was a sort of present for the whole family. It was a ZX81 home computer. I’d seen them advertised on TV and in comics but I never imagined we’d own one; we didn’t even have a video recorder. I remember seeing the instruction manual for the first time, with its beautiful illustration of a gigantic starship, and I understood straightaway that the thing my dad was at that moment plugging into the TV was the future. My whole family sat around the screen and took it in turns to type in one of the BASIC program listings from that weighty booklet. The result was a game in which you had to input coordinates to throw a ball into a waste-paper basket. I can’t even begin to describe how exciting that was. There was something on the TV that we’d made, and that we could interact with. It was a revelation.
For families all over Britain, Clive Sinclair – who has died aged 81 – brought computers home. The hobbyist computer market, which introduced the likes of Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak to programming, was not as well-developed in this country and required some engineering expertise – you built computers such as the Altair 8800 yourself. The ZX81, you could buy in Boots or WH Smiths or from the Argos catalogue, and it was all there for you. For £70. A lot of money for my family at the time, but not too much.

                    <span>This is not about what’s best for broadcasting: it is that today’s Tory party hates the channel’s progressive output
Margaret Thatcher was right. When her more ideologically charged followers sought to privatise Channel 4 in the heyday of 1980s free-market capitalism, the patron saint of flogging off public assets said no: she was correctly advised that such a move would fatally undermine its public service duty and trash its standards.
It is fashionable these days to claim Boris Johnson’s Tories lean left on the economy and right on culture: their planned selloff of Channel 4 is totemic of how true blue ideology remains king on both fronts. While ministers define their patriotism by the size of the Union Jack in their living rooms, they prepare an act of gross cultural vandalism, with dozens of British TV production companies facing collapse.

                    <span>It’s not just animals that are at risk of dying out, the world’s crops are in rapid decline. Here’s why it matters what is on your plate
In eastern Turkey, in a golden field overshadowed by grey mountains, I reached out and touched an endangered species. Its ancestors had evolved over millions of years and migrated here long ago. It had been indispensable to life in the villages across this plateau, but its time was running out. “Just a few fields left,” the farmer said. “Extinction will come easily.” This endangered species wasn’t a rare bird or an elusive wild animal, it was food, a type of wheat: a less familiar character in the extinction story now playing out around the world, but one we all need to know.
To most of us, one field of wheat might look much like any other, but this crop was extraordinary. Kavilca (pronounced Kav-all-jah) had turned eastern Anatolian landscapes the colour of honey for 400 generations (about 10,000 years). It was one of the world’s earliest cultivated foods, and is now one of the rarest.

Mark Drakeford also said people should work from home wherever possible and vowed that firmer action would be taken against people who do not wear face coverings when legally required to do so, for example in shops or on public transport.

Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington has warned mutual enmity between Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau could make rather than break the United States at Whistling Straits.
Koepka and DeChambeau have traded public blows for much of this year, forming an intriguing backdrop to next weekend’s visit of Harrington’s team to the US. The PGA Tour had to step in to warn unruly spectators not to goad DeChambeau during tournaments.

After a school trip to Swanage, where we visited the sand dunes of Studland national nature reserve, I unpacked my clothes and put my bag away in a cupboard. When I entered the cupboard a few hours later I was confronted by a bright green lizard! Unbeknown to me, the male sand lizard had hitched a lift, probably when I put my bag down for lunch, and travelled the 50 miles back to our home in Wiltshire. I was fascinated but my parents weren’t willing to travel the distance to return the protected and rare reptile, so I let it free in our garden. It probably didn’t survive but it did add to my fascination with the natural world. Ellis Selway, ecologist, Cambridgeshire

The retail phenomenon of 2021 is not a new fashion craze, electronic gadget or children’s toy. The most discussed items in today’s shops are “empty shelves”. And as the problems have grown, the arguments have raged: was it Brexit? Is it the pandemic? Is it a UK problem or a worldwide issue?
In fact, though both the pandemic and the new restrictions on EU trade and free movement have contributed to shortages on the shelves and to companies cutting their production despite demand, the roots of this market failure predate both by decades.

                    <span>For three years, this column has been looking for sources of quotidian joy in the darkness. As it comes to an end, what tiny delights would other writers nominate?
Three years ago, I trotted up to the Weekend desk in the Guardian’s offices with what one editor calls my “ideas look”. My idea was this: a space had opened up in the magazine and I thought I might fill it with a column on the small, everyday things that can bring cheer. (The late, great Clive James, whose writing I adored, had wrapped up his column – what an unbelievable honour to succeed him.)
I had recently been given a copy of JB Priestley’s Delight and, truly, it was. Priestley was known as a bit of a grumpster, so this collection of essays explaining his own micro-pleasures was something of a rebuttal. It was perfect to dip into.

Anele Dyasi’s story is no fairytale, though, and the school in question is not Hogwarts, but the College of Magic in Cape Town, a unique institution that has been training some of the continent’s most skilled illusionists since the 1980s.

Voters punish governments that lose control. That has been one of the ruling assumptions of British politics and political commentary since the 1970s. In that infamous decade, Tory and Labour governments alike fell largely because they allowed everyday life to be seriously disrupted – first during the 1974 three-day week, then during the 1978-9 “winter of discontent”.
Boris Johnson has presided over more disruption than any prime minister for decades: in education, agriculture, construction, the courts, manufacturing, exports and imports, the hospitality industry, retail and, above all, public health policy. He has rarely been able to present himself as in control of events. And unlike the crises of the 1970s – which led to almost no loss of life – his premiership has seen tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.

                    <span>Fikile Ntshangase was involved in a legal dispute over the extension of an opencast mine when she was shot dead in her home. Her daughter Malungelo Xhakaza tells her story to Rachel Humphreys
In October last year, Fikile Ntshangase, 65, was at her home in Ophondweni in South Africa when three men burst in and she was shot dead. The murder was witnessed by her 13-year-old grandson. No one has so far been charged with any part in the crime.
Ntshangase’s daughter Malungelo Xhakaza tells Rachel Humphreys that her mother had been involved in a legal dispute over the extension of an opencast mine operated by Tendele Coal near Somkhele, close to Hluhluwe–Imfolozi park, the oldest nature reserve in Africa. She campaigned as part of the Mfolozi Community Environmental Justice Organisation.

The Duke of Edinburgh’s will is to remain secret to protect the “dignity” of the Queen because of her constitutional role, the high court has ruled. Philip – the nation’s longest-serving consort – died aged 99 on 9 April, just two months before he would have turned 100.
After the death of a senior member of the royal family, it has been convention for over a century that an application to seal their will is made to the president of the family division of the high court. This means the wills of senior members of the royal family are not open to public inspection in the way a will would ordinarily be.

                    <span>Inconsistent use of domestic violence disclosure scheme putting women at risk, says inspectorate
Clare’s Law, a scheme designed to protect unsuspecting women from new partners with a history of violence, is not being used properly by police forces, putting some women at risk of harm, a policing watchdog has warned.
In a far-reaching review of the police response to violence against women and girls, inspectors found the domestic violence disclosure scheme (DVDS), also known as Clare’s Law, was being inconsistently used across England and Wales.

It has been a tough opening four games for Newcastle, amassing one point and conceding 12 goals. Three-quarters of those concessions have come in the second half, a sign they cannot maintain their concentration for a full 90 minutes and that perhaps they need to be fitter. It is great to keep things tight in the opening half but it means very little when things fall apart after the break. Steve Bruce’s side need to keep their first-half rigidity for the whole match, whether that means a change of personnel or an improved training regime. Leeds are a team who operate at a relentless pace and their movement in the final third will cause the legs to weaken if they get on top of the opposition, potentially leaving Newcastle in for another very difficult night.

The pharmaceuticals firm GSK has struck a five-year partnership with King’s College London to use artificial intelligence to develop personalised treatments for cancer by investigating the role played by genetics in the disease.
The tie-up, which involves 10 of the drug maker’s artificial intelligence experts working with 10 oncology specialists from King’s across their labs, will use computing to “play chess with cancer”, working out why only a fifth of patients respond well to immuno-oncology treatments.

One in three Britons drink plant-based milk, according to a report that suggests they have become a mainstream choice for consumers.
Shoppers spent £100m more in 2020 on alt-milks, made from oats, almonds or soya, turning it into a near £400m-a-year market.

Prince Andrew can request the unsealing of a 2009 settlement agreement that his lawyer claims protects him from a lawsuit alleging he sexually assaulted a girl two decades ago, a US judge in New York has said.
Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan said in a written order on Thursday that the prince could seek the information to support arguments that the agreement between Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein disallows her lawsuit against the prince.

                    <span>A care home worker and a patient with young onset Alzheimer’s form a bond – then Covid strikes. What a harrowing and important film this is … until the third act
Help, a one-off drama starring Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham and written by Jack Thorne, is set in a care home in 2020. Which is to say, in essence, a plague house. Even if not all the stratospherically high expectations roused by such a holy trinity of talent are quite met, it still provides in the first two thirds of its 90-minute run one of the most evocative and harrowing depictions of recent history we have yet seen.
Comer plays a 20-year-old newly qualified carer, Sarah, who starts a job looking after residents in a Liverpudlian care home and finds she is unexpectedly good at the feeding, changing, cajoling, cheering and calming that makes up the average day. Tony (Graham) has young onset Alzheimer’s and a tendency to roam if not gently monitored. He is one of the more able residents and they form a friendship alongside her duty of care, fostered by games of Shithead over which they trade stories of their respective misspent youths. There are lovely, funny, poignant scenes as they talk, laugh then suddenly have to negotiate the blanks in Tony’s memory and ride the mood swings his relentlessly advancing condition causes.

Houghton talking on eve of first World Cup 2023 qualifier

The defender Steph Houghton said England “really feel they have the potential to go and do something special” at next summer’s European Championship on the eve of their first World Cup 2023 qualifying match against North Macedonia on Friday night. Houghton, who will captain the team on Friday night and against Luxembourg on Tuesday while the new manager, Sarina Wiegman, takes time to decide on her long-term captain, added that this is a chance for the team to “start afresh”.
“It’s a clean slate for everyone,” Houghton said. “After the World Cup, results weren’t up to our standard and what was expected of an England team. There were some performances that were below par, but for me and for the rest of the players it’s about going out there, playing our football and showing everyone what a good team we are.”

                    <span>Everything was looking rosy for Leicester, leaving aside the fact that they had been largely outplayed. Fine goals by Ayoze Pérez and Harvey Barnes gave them a two-goal lead over Napoli, their main rivals in Group C and the joint favourites to win the tournament outright. But late goals by the outstanding Victor Osimhen earned a share of the points, which was the least the classy visitors deserved.
Leicester’s frustration deepened when Wilfred Ndidi was sent off in stoppage time for a second bookable offence. Worse followed in the stands after the final whistle when a smattering of home fans clashed with Napoli supporters, with police and stewards breaking up skirmishes while bottles were hurled by people on both sides. Uefa is sure to investigate. Here is a snap judgement: it was a pathetic sight at the end of an exhilarating contest on the pitch.

Matty Ashton scores hat-trick for visitors

In the end, the scriptwriters must have been having a night off. It simply wasn’t supposed to end like this for Daryl Powell and Castleford Tigers. Take the sight of the club’s legendary long-serving captain, Michael Shenton, leaving the field for the final time as a Castleford player with his shoulder in a sling. Or the raw emotion spilling through Jesse Sene-Lefao, Peter Mata’utia and Oliver Holmes, whose time at the club came to an end in ultimately disappointing fashion here.
And that is before you come to Powell himself. There were enough subplots here to comprise a soap opera, chief among them the fact that Powell was attempting to beat the club he will coach next season to guide his home town club into the play-offs. However, that wasn’t to be and the harsh reality is that they had nobody to blame but themselves after arguably the worst first-half performance of his entire eight-year spell in charge.

England skittled New Zealand for 211 in 46.3 overs at Bristol to take first blood in the ODI series, winning by 30 runs despite being bowled out for an under-par 241 earlier in the day.
Put in to bat, England had sunk to 140 for five in the 32nd over. But captain Heather Knight’s calm, controlled 89 marshalled a recovery for the second time in as many matches, this time assisted by a streaky but quickfire 43 in 51 balls from Katherine Brunt.

The foreign minister of the Netherlands, Sigrid Kaag, has resigned after the lower house of parliament passed a motion of censure against the government over its handling of evacuations from Afghanistan amid the Taliban takeover.
In a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, Kaag acknowledged that the government’s slow or muddled response to warnings about the situation in Afghanistan meant some local staff and people who had worked as translators for Dutch troops in the country had not been evacuated.

Bad news for the more affectionate Premiership players on the eve of the new season – face-to-face try celebrations are still banned. Supporters can fill stadiums again – no Covid passports necessary – but pity the foolish front-rowers who fancy a post-match hug. Welcome to the contradictory world of modern sport.
That is not to pick holes in protocols nor point fingers at administrators, rather it is to illustrate the difficulties in plotting the uneasy route towards normality. Clubs can look forward to the new season with optimism all the while fearful of what another wave may entail as autumn turns to winter.

Tottenham came from behind to draw 2-2 in their opening Europa Conference League Group G game at Rennes, but it was a costly evening as they suffered more injury problems.
In their toughest looking assignment of the inaugural third-tier European club competition they went ahead through Loïc Badé’s early own goal before the French team hit back either side of half-time through Flavien Tait and Gaëtan Laborde.

Gareth Southgate has said he urgently needs to hire more women to work with the England men’s football team, after accepting the current training setup is “nowhere near where we should be” when it comes to gender equality.
The England manager named just two women who currently work with the squad to prepare them for international matches. He said the Football Association as a whole was better on gender equality, with about 38% of staff being female. “But as my daughter said to me: ‘Oh, that’s good is it?’”

The amount of diesel pollution on some new trains is 13 times higher than on one of central London’s busiest roads, researchers found.
Passengers travelling onboard a Great Western Railway carriage running from London to Bristol, procured by the government as part of a £5.7bn scheme, were subject to huge spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution when it switched to diesel from electric.

Tonderai Munyevu reflects on the men who have loomed large in his life in a thought-provoking show
‘Where are you from?” It’s a question that writer and actor Tonderai Munyevu gets a lot. In the opening moments of Mugabe, My Dad and Me, he recalls it being asked by a white man he was serving in a bar, who went on to offer strong, ill-informed opinions about Munyevu’s native Zimbabwe. This show is Munyevu’s response.
As the title suggests, it revolves around two men who have loomed large in Munyevu’s life, each shaped by Zimbabwe’s violent colonial history: controversial former president Robert Mugabe, and Munyevu’s heavy-drinking, often absent father. He traces the outlines of their lives both before and after Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, interspersed with his own experience as a member of the diaspora, having moved to the UK as a child. It’s an ambitious piece, tackling colonialism, neo-colonialism and different understandings of land, ownership and belonging.

                    <span>It was some way for West Ham to silence the doubts about their inexperience on the European stage. They answered the questions by playing like seasoned travellers. There were no stumbles from David Moyes’s players as they took their first steps into the unknown and in the end, with Dinamo Zagreb confounded by West Ham’s organisation, it was hard to tell which team were supposed to be the novices at this level.
Moyes could not have asked for a more commanding away performance. West Ham were sharper and savvier throughout, their maturity and inventiveness key as they started their Europa League campaign with a memorable win. Dinamo were outplayed and had no answers to goals from Michail Antonio and Declan Rice, who killed the game as a contest with a stunning solo effort early in the second half.

In a U-turn after similar plans were cancelled this year, News UK said it would hire “exceptional talent” for the station. Bosses believe Morgan fits in that category and is the biggest name to have signed up to the project.

Ministers are to slash the number of “red list” countries by up to half as part of plans to simplify England’s rules for international travel, with sources claiming it would incentivise vaccination.
The traffic light system will be overhauled, with the amber tier removed so there is a clearer distinction between “go” and “no go” destinations.

                    <span>The prime minister represents the triumph of a politics where some of the people are fooled all of the time
In Westminster it is often said that politics drives the timing of decisions. But this week’s reshuffle by Boris Johnson is just the opposite: the timing is driving the politics. The prime minister is eyeing an early election, which could come as soon as 2023. He wants his party to be energised by new faces before his party conference. Mr Johnson’s changes are not ideological but about ministerial ambitions, accomplishments and personalities. The government he leads will have a new character rather than new direction.
Leaving the cabinet are ministers (Gavin Williamson at education) who were deemed inadequate, replaced by politicians who can point to being successful (vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi). In terms of personalities, Nadine Dorries is a rightwing populist with the culture brief overseeing her bête noire: the BBC. As for personal ambitions, Mr Johnson has elevated a potential successor, Liz Truss, to foreign secretary.

                    <span>The agreement between the US, UK and Australia strengthens old ties as a new era unfolds in the Indo-Pacific region
No one – least of all Beijing – believes the denials. The new defence pact between the US, UK and Australia is unmistakably aimed at containing China. The question is how substantive it will prove to be. The initial project – Canberra’s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, with Washington and London’s help – is prompted in part by growing Australian frustration over its troubled contract for French-made vessels. But it opens the way for greater military cooperation and is to be underpinned by wide-ranging collaboration on areas such as cyber-security, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which China is pursuing intensively.
Joe Biden appears to be realising Barack Obama’s pledge of a pivot to Asia, with US capacity freed by withdrawal from Afghanistan, and China’s behaviour ringing alarm bells internationally. The Aukus pact binds the UK and Australia more closely to the US position, and should augment US military power in the region (though France, Europe’s most significant Indo-Pacific player, is openly furious). Though Boris Johnson has highlighted the promise of UK jobs, a White House official described the deal as a “downpayment on global Britain”.

If you thought the world of social media influencers and digital commerce “platforms” was baffling already, Matthew Moulding is not about to make THG, or the Hut Group as it was, any easier to understand.
In its latest rejig, the hyperactive company plans to spin-off its beauty operation that owns the Lookfantastic cosmetics website. THG would retain a majority stake but, since THG Beauty is the group’s biggest division, the move is odd – certainly for a company that floated only a year ago.

                    <span>Expert tells inquiry WCM’s plans are not legally compliant under UK’s and EU’s policy frameworks
The company seeking to open the UK’s first new deep coalmine in 30 years is gambling on the UK’s and EU’s failure to address climate change, the public inquiry into the mining plans has heard.
An expert witness for one of the parties opposed to West Cumbria Mining’s (WCM) plans to dig up 2.7m tonnes of coking coal a year says the firm’s case for the mine rests on the assumption that UK and EU governments will breach their legally binding climate targets by using the coal to supply steelmaking over the coming decades.

Kate O’Shaugnessy was stood down from her job in hospitality when Sydney’s first lockdown began in March 2020. She found herself confined to an apartment in the inner-eastern suburb of Zetland.
The promise of more space, as well as growing opportunities in regional Australia, led her to take up the offer of work in Tamworth in July 2020. In April this year she returned to the city in central New South Wales where she grew up: Dubbo.

The timing of the new defence deal between the US, UK and Australia has dismayed climate experts, who fear it could have a negative effect on hopes of a deal with China on greenhouse gas emissions ahead of vital UN climate talks.
The Aukus trilateral security partnership has been interpreted as seeking to counterbalance Chinese power in the Asia-Pacific region, and has been likened to a new cold war by China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson warned the three countries to “respect regional people’s aspiration and do more that is conducive to regional peace and stability and development – otherwise they will only end up hurting their own interests”.

The new works, which will include the 2019 Booker prize-winning novel Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, will mean that 28% of texts available for study for OCR’s GCSE and A-level courses from next September are by writers of colour – the majority of them women – up from 13% beforehand.

New housing secretary Michael Gove is facing calls to return £100,000 in donations he received last month from a property developer, with political opponents warning of a potential conflict of interest.
Parliamentary records show that Gove registered two donations of £50,000 from a German property developer, Zak Gertler,three weeks ago. The Gertler family developed offices in Germany and has been linked to property deals in London and Birmingham after moving into the UK in the 1990s. The new housing, communities and local government secretary previously accepted £10,000 from the same donor in July 2016 to help his abortive party leadership bid after the Brexit referendum, and the same amount again in June 2019.

When Germany elects a new government on 26 September the average voter age may be over 50, but a week and a half before polling day it is children who are asking the hard questions of the candidates who want to fill Angela Merkel’s shoes.
Armin Laschet, of the outgoing chancellor’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Olaf Scholz, of the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), were both left shifting in their seats in what has been hailed as their toughest grilling of the campaign trail – at the hands of two 11-year-olds.

For employers struggling to find staff, Britain’s worst labour shortage in decades is seen as putting the economic recovery from lockdown at risk. For workers, it comes as a moment of opportunity.
“For the first time in a generation, it’s a seller’s market for workers,” said Andy Prendergast, a national secretary at the GMB. The union organiser, who represents drivers and couriers in the logistics sector, said there was a rush of activity among members pushing for better pay and conditions.

                    <span>The Invisible Host, a 1930 murder mystery by two US journalists, has remarkable parallels with Christie’s most successful work
A group of guests are invited to a party but, when they arrive, their mysterious host tells them by broadcast that they will all die by morning. This is not in fact the well-known plot of Agatha Christie’s And Then There Were None but that of The Invisible Host, a novel which was published nine years earlier than Christie’s bestseller, and which is about to be released in the UK for the first time.
Independent publisher Dean Street Press describes The Invisible Host as “the widely suspected inspiration” for And Then There Were None. Christie’s 1939 novel is her biggest-selling title, with sales of more than 100m. It opens with 10 people arriving on a Devon island, having been invited by a mysterious host. As they sit down for dinner, a record begins to play, on which a voice accuses them of murder. “We’re not going to leave the island. None of us will ever leave. It’s the end, you see – the end of everything …”

                    <span>As a stylist and creative director of Perfect magazine, Jeanie Annan-Lewin is a buzz name in the fashion industry. She’s come a long way since interning at Tatler …
Jeanie Annan-Lewin has 20k Instagram followers and is creative director of Perfect magazine, a biannual magazine edited by Katie Grand and launched in a blaze of hype with its Issue Zero in March. As such, on paper at least, Annan-Lewin is very much a fashion success story. But, she says, the reality is not that simple. “As a Black woman, I’m in a space where I am constantly told it’s not for me, but then I am used as the blueprint for everything else,” she says. “Black women in the fashion industry aren’t given the fair space to be able to do things creatively.”
Working with Perfect, Annan-Lewin is trying to create a new way of doing things. “For me, fashion is great – it’s wonderful – but it’s not very inclusive,” she says. “Katie and I are trying to be thought-provoking and inclusive and not just making things to make them. I don’t think you can do things for shits and giggles any more.”

It was saddening to read Len McCluskey’s account (I trusted Keir Starmer – until I saw how he handled Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension, 13 September), but I can appreciate why this episode broke his personal relationship with Keir Starmer. Likewise, I understand why McCluskey formed the view that Starmer “was not a man of his word”. 
Since you published a statement about Labour’s approach from one of its frontbenchers that “it’s about bringing a level of brutality” (‘No strategy, programme or project’: Labour divided ahead of conference, 7 August), I have looked in vain for this to be disavowed by the leader’s office. Promoting mistrust, division and brutality may seemingly bring victory in short-term internal party battles, but it is not a strategy for winning longer-term popular support from voters.

The British Council is most certainly not “the British government’s cultural arm” as suggested by your article (British Council to close 20 offices across globe after cuts and lost income, 9 September). It is a public corporation and charity, governed by royal charter. Unfortunately, most of its funding comes from the government and because of the pandemic shortfall on language tuition and other services, it will not be able to balance its books.
As someone who has worked with the council in Africa, I can tell you that far too many politicians simply do not understand the good that the British Council does for the UK’s reputation, and the despair and disappointment when its offices are closed. Alliance Française and the Goethe-Institut do not suffer from such political indifference and have funding that makes the UK’s equivalent, the British Council, look seriously third-rate.

                    <span>Unless the industry starts taking sustainability seriously, it risks becoming the thing it most dreads – uncool
Fashion has become a dirty word – and believe me, it hurts. Not long ago, fashion was the VIP room of popular culture and movie stars and politicians flocked to the front row. Now it has come to symbolise everything that is wrong with the modern world – from carbon emissions to global inequality and from crass materialism to unrealistic beauty standards. Fashion is not the only polluting industry, or the only morally dubious one. But even if you love fashion, as I do, it’s hard to deny that it tracks in the 99th percentile for pretty much all of the most problematic contemporary issues.
Everyone in fashion knows that they need to get back on the right side of history, and fast. Sustainability is a baseline responsibility that every self-respecting brand must be seen to engage with. The New York brand Collina Strada last week staged one of the first live shows of the first back-to-real-life catwalk season on the rooftop of Brooklyn Grange, an organic city farm that donates 30% of its produce to community members with limited means. Much of the collection was made out of “deadstock” – fabric and product that already exists, rather than being newly produced. Clothes made in 2020, which had been stuck in lockdown and never shipped or sold, were cut up and repurposed into something new. “Old birthday presents” were taken apart and reassembled into beaded bags and rhinestone jewellery, said the designer Hillary Taymour. Taymour was rewarded with a benediction in the form of Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter of the vice-president, Kamala Harris, applauding from the front row.

Thousands of laws and regulations are to be reviewed, modified or repealed under a new programme aimed at cementing the UK’s independence and “Brexit opportunities”, David Frost has announced.

US congressional investigators say they have uncovered “very concerning” new documents about ExxonMobil’s disinformation campaign to discredit climate science.
Representative Ro Khanna, a leading critic of the petroleum industry on the House oversight committee, said the documents came to light ahead of a hearing next month to question the heads of large oil companies about their industry’s long history of undermining the evidence that burning fossil fuels drove global heating.

                    <span>Why did Van Gogh, Manet and Cezanne worship this incendiary painter of everyday people? Because, as a new show reveals, his range and compassion were staggering
Not many of the world’s greatest works of art can be called funny. Yet The Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals has an undeniable cocky humour. A painting of this unknown man has hung in London’s Wallace Collection since the 19th century, his flamboyant upward turned moustache and tiny point of a beard setting off the confident brightness of his eyes above a huge frilly ruff and a sleeve laced with gold. Now the gallery is about to celebrate its most famous painting in an exhibition offering a chance to look closer at other male portraits by Hals.
So what has his cavalier got to laugh about? Maybe what’s tickling him is the fact that a Dutch artist who died poor in 1666 would help inspire the birth of modern art. We’re conditioned to think of this as something that suddenly happened in 1900, but the Paris avant garde had already kicked away the foundations of the past. From Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet to Paul Cézanne, these 19th-century rebels pulverised convention and forced art into their brutal, ironic modern world of railways, brothels and absinthe. And the incendiary creator of The Laughing Cavalier was their hero.

                    <span>She was groomed as a child and has endured trauma – and to say she now ‘looks western’ is an insult to British Muslims

Dr Gina Vale is a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation

In her first live interview since joining Islamic State (IS), on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, 22-year-old Shamima Begum made her latest appeal to return to the UK. She is one of over 6,000 minors who became affiliated with IS, but ever since the grainy CCTV pictures emerged of her leaving the UK with two east London schoolmates in 2015, her case has captured international media attention. 
Begum’s case first raises the issue of accountability of minors who become radicalised. At first, media reporting described the three girls as being “lured” into IS, comparing their childhood innocence to the monstrosity of their recruiters. The then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wrote to their school saying, “We hope and pray for the safe return of the pupils”. In the rush to explain the fact that young girls could turn away from their lives in Britain to join a terrorist organisation, the “jihadi bride” narrative took hold – a catch-all phrase that focuses on girls’ romantic motives.

Twelve years ago, Mélanie Laurent was shooting Inglourious Basterds, playing a Jewish fugitive on the run from diabolical Christoph Waltz. At the end of each day’s shooting, Quentin Tarantino played music on set. After one particularly arduous day, David Bowie’s Cat People boomed out of the speakers. “We would dance. It was glorious,” she recalls.
On the film’s release, Laurent was touted as France’s next big thing. Peter Bradshaw wrote: “She could easily be the new French star to make the crossover into the Anglo-Saxon film world, like Catherine Deneuve or Juliette Binoche or Emmanuelle Béart or Marion Cotillard.”

What – where is all the mediocre art? Yinka Shonibare has turned this annual event into a thrilling, thoughtful showcase boasting giant fruit and Colston in chains
The statue of Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy, is usually garlanded with flowers when the Summer Exhibition is on. This year the bronze figure in the courtyard wears instead a sash of Dutch wax print, the fabric of complex colonial histories that British Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare has made his trademark. As coordinator of this year’s show, Shonibare starts as he means to go on – not so much denouncing the establishment as tricking it, getting it to see things his way and leaving it more radically transformed than if he’d actually toppled Sir Joshua.
Let’s not sentimentalise history. The RA was founded in 1768, bang in the middle of Britain’s most profitable engagement in the transatlantic slave trade, by artists happy to portray slavers. So there’s historical justice in the revolution Shonibare enacts in the grand salons of Burlington House. He exacts retribution with a smile and blows up ingrained inequality with the kindest of explosives. Everyone will leave happy – and changed.

The new international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, has been accused of rejecting the science behind the climate emergency after a series of tweets came to light showing her dismissing those who believe in global heating as “fanatics”.
Labour has condemned the appointment of Trevelyan, who was elevated from junior business minister, which took in the brief of promoting clean growth, to replace Liz Truss, the new foreign secretary, as part of Boris Johnson’s reshuffle on Wednesday.

Populism is never quite as popular as it looks. Or at least, people can only take so much of it before needing a break.
That’s one lesson to draw from the slow-motion car crash of GB News, which had lost much of its audience long before losing its star presenter, Andrew Neil. Being angry round the clock is exhausting, to the point where even the most committed cultural warrior sometimes just wants to relax with a nice episode of Countdown. GB News seemingly failed to recognise that in time. But the Conservative party, judging by the last few weeks, is more alert to the problem.

                    <span>She warbled the theme to The Saint, sang with Springfield – and fed Hendrix shepherd’s pie. Yet outside the music industry, the late musician is still unknown – why? 
In 1968, when Barbara Moore picked up the conductor’s baton in the immense EMI Studio 1, the assembled musicians were incredulous. Moore was better known to them as a backing singer, a regular in the all-female singing group the Ladybirds. Although she had already released her own piano album, A Little Moore Barbara, few realised her potential as a composer and arranger. “My name was at the bottom of a list at EMI,” she said in 2012 to one interviewer, Lorraine Bowen. However, a flu pandemic had left everyone else out of action, so Moore received an unexpected call from the producer Tony Palmer. “He said: ‘I understand you’re an arranger … I need an album doing in six days – could you do it?’”
As Moore – who died last month at 89 – addressed the EMI orchestra, she was shaking so much that the baton slipped out of her hand. But any disrespect in the room evaporated when the players ploughed through her first arrangement: a rocky, orchestral version of Scarborough Fair for the up-and-coming folk singer Deena Webster. “I’d worked day and night at the piano, singing the lead line, thinking: that’s got to be brass, that’s strings,” she said in 2012. “You didn’t know really what it was going to sound like. It sounded lovely.” Moore recalled the hugs and applause that followed the final bars of her arrangement. “I tell you – it was the most beautiful few minutes of 80 years.”

Harding, who as Liberal Democrat candidate lost out in Raab’s Esher and Walton seat by just 2,700 votes in the 2019 election, was door-knocking in an area that could barely look more Conservative, but was nonetheless proving fruitful.

The corporation took BBC Three off air in 2016, despite it being the home of hits from Fleabag to Killing Eve, deciding that an online-only version would make it easier to attract young audiences.

                    <span>Since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, more than 1m tonnes of radioactive water has been building up at the power plant in central Japan. Soon the plant will run out of space to store the water, which is a big problem. The plan at the moment is to dump it all in the sea. So how do you go about making 1m tonnes of radioactive water, safe to drink?

Spears previously flirted with dubstep on 2007’s Blackout, but it was Hold It Against Me that dragged the then-underground dance music into the mainstream. A decade later, and its blistering amalgamation of industrial EDM and saccharine pop melodies still feels every bit as audacious and innovative.

                    <span>Skeleton found by children in New Zealand helps fill in gaps in natural history
In January 2006 a group of children in summer camp in Waikato, New Zealand, went on a fossil-hunting field trip with a seasoned archaeologist. They kayaked to the upper Kawhia harbour, a hotspot for this sort of activity, and they expected to find fossils of shellfish and the like, as they regularly did on these Hamilton junior naturalist club expeditions.
But on this day, just before heading home, close to where they’d left the kayaks and well below the high tide mark, they noticed a trace of fossils that looked like much more than prehistoric crustaceans. After careful extraction, an archaeologist later identified it as the most complete fossilised skeleton of an ancient giant penguin yet uncovered.

Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor

When Boris Johnson reshuffled his cabinet in February last year, it did not go as planned. Despite Johnson still riding high after his election victory, ministers complained about No 10’s abrasive approach, supporters said promises of jobs made to them during the leadership campaign hadn’t been delivered, and MPs from the older intakes smarted at the promotion of their younger colleagues ahead of them.
The whole exercise proved so bad for party morale that for more than a year Johnson and his chief whip have been firmly put off carrying out another. Stories of imminent reshuffles have come and gone with nothing to show for them. Those who argued in favour of one were told by No 10 aides: “Good luck convincing the prime minister.”

All cooks, however competent, have a kitchen skill that defeats them. Some cannot make mayonnaise. Others have a blind spot with pastry. Me? I cannot make bechamel. The first time I tried, it split. It turned into a coagulated, grainy mess, like the milky sick that newborns regurgitate down your back when you burp them. It happened the second time. And the third time. And for ever after that. Now it’s as if the ingredients, the butter and the flour and the milk, can sense my fear and shame. They sit on the work surface staring up at me. We know what you want us to become, they say. We know all about the velvety white sauce you wish us to be. Well, dream on, sucker. Not today.
Once, during lockdown, while making souffle Suisse, that indecent Le Gavroche confection of gruyere, cream and whipped, bechamel-enriched egg whites which certain puritanical religious sects would doubtless regard as profoundly immoral, it worked. I made a perfect example. Hooray for me. Nailed it. But it turned out the ingredients were merely laughing at me. Because the next time it split, and the time after that, and so on.

Care homes may be forced to close and thousands of staff risk losing their jobs if they decline to receive their first Covid-19 vaccine by the end of Thursday, ministers have been warned.
Providers and unions have warned of an exodus of staff in England due to the government’s requirement for them to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus by 11 November. Thursday has been set as their last opportunity for a first dose unless they are medically exempt.

                    <span>The reboot of the Yorkshire vet drama is a gentle back-rub of a show, and proved the perfect answer to lockdown woes. As it returns, its winning formula looks even more charming
When Channel 5 decided to revive James Herriot’s All Creatures Great and Small – first broadcast between 1978 and 1990 – it could not possibly have known what sort of a world the new version would crash into. It debuted last September to a viewing audience that had grown cowed and fearful due to the pandemic. The evenings were drawing in, and the glorious summer weather – the only thing that kept many of us buoyant – was starting to give way to the murk of autumn. Think back to this time a year ago: your brain was so busy trying to fend off the anxiety of the unknown that the last thing you wanted was to be challenged by prestige TV. You fell back on old favourites, or sitcoms, or cartoons, or anything to distract you from the shape of the world.

The past decade has been a bruising one for the health of European democracy. The dramatic authoritarian turns in Hungary and Poland have attracted most attention, but nearly all European governments have chipped away at civil liberties, judicial independence and civil society.
With Covid accentuating many of the challenges posed by populism, disinformation and a collapse in public trust, the narrative of democracy labouring in deep crisis is now well established. Yet as the threats have mounted, so have efforts to defend and rethink Europe’s democratic practices.

                    <span>The DUP thought Brexit was a chance to get a hard border back, but now they cling to the vestiges of their old dominance
Unionism saw in Brexit an opportunity to wreck the Good Friday agreement and get a hard border back. Instead, it is any prospect of the survival of Northern Ireland that has been demolished. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson admitted in an interview at the weekend that if Sinn Féin took the first minister’s post at Stormont, it would be a problem for unionists.
The latest opinion poll showed Sinn Féin poised to be country’s largest party on 25%, with the DUP plummeting to 13%, now surpassed on the unionist side by the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV). Next year’s census will probably show that the Catholic community is now larger than the Protestant one. An election is due in the spring of 2022. This is the context in which we must view Donaldson’s threat to pull out of the executive, and his decision to stop co-operating with the Irish government in cross-border bodies. The protocol is a fig leaf, and one plucked from a tree the DUP and Boris Johnson planted.

In recent years, an ever-expanding body of scientific research has shown that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are among the most toxic substances widely used in consumer products.

                    <span>Blinded by medical intervention as a baby, Billups became one of the leaders of a groundbreaking, world-shaking 1977 protest. He talks about what drives him and why Barack Obama loves his energy
“My mother used to tell us we had to be really good,” says Dennis Billups. “There were always two strikes against us – so you had to hit the third strike out of the park.” The “strikes” were being Black and being blind. And growing up in San Francisco in the 1960s and 70s, both were potential sources of open discrimination. “There were times when, even walking in our own neighbourhood, we would get: ‘You’re supposed to stay inside.’ ‘Don’t you have a dog?’ ‘Don’t you have a cane?’” At times this could turn physical. “Some neighbours would turn water on us and stuff like that.” Finding employment was also a challenge. “Being blind, they didn’t have to do too much except say: ‘We’re not going to hire you,’ or: ‘We don’t think you can do this.’ So it was a glass ceiling, more or less. I’m sure with my twin sister there was a lot more, being a woman, African American and blind as well, but she was a hell of a fighter.”
Billups is a fighter, too, albeit one whose principal weapons are determination, congeniality, optimism – and a mellifluous voice. Now in his late 60s, speaking on Zoom from the San Francisco public library, he still radiates an infectious positivity that helped him as a young man when he played a key role in a lesser-known battle for civil rights.

Good news from a hotelier who contacted me when his business interruption cover failed to compensate him for lockdown losses. Now, over a year after QIC Europe told CD of Powys that Covid did not count as a “notifiable disease within a 25-mile radius”, it has agreed to pay. 
CD’s battle shows the lengths insurers will go to bat away expensive liabilities. QIC, via its broker Davies Group, had variously insisted the pandemic did not render the hotel uninhabitable, despite lockdown, and that there was no demonstrable link between Covid and the hotel’s losses. It then magicked up a clause absent from its policy terms at the time of the claim stating that lockdowns and pandemics weren’t covered.

For well over 30 years I’ve supported York City with varying degrees of enthusiasm or indifference that have almost always led me to miss the occasional achievements and witness long periods of mediocrity, or worse. I’ve watched an ever-changing cast of players who, with some honourable exceptions, have left an indelible blank on my memory. Leagues have come and gone. Relegations have outnumbered promotions. My club’s fortunes have risen and fallen, and fallen further still. But there was always one constant: Bootham Crescent, home of York City since 1932.

The 17-year-old footballer with the Afghan national youth team had taken a break from studying maths for his exams to accompany his brother as he tried to catch a flight. Zaki had always told his family he was not interested in going abroad, unless he could return to Afghanistan.
But the Taliban takeover had changed things. Zaki did not have a passport but, as night fell on Kabul after the Taliban took control of the city, he told his brother Zakir that he wanted to leave. Zakir did his best to talk him out of it, but he would not let go of the idea.

When Joe Biden announced sweeping federal coronavirus vaccine requirements for 100 million Americans, the White House was braced for objections from Republican opponents.
But this being 2021, the rightwing backlash has gone way beyond mere political debate into the realm of incendiary language that, analysts fear, could translate into direct and violent action.

                    <span>Dating apps can be difficult and daunting at the best of times, and many users give up on them entirely. But for some the pandemic was a chance to reassess their priorities, and they were able to forge a much deeper connection


When the country first went into lockdown, I – reluctantly – reloaded my dating app. With the world on pause and friends navigating the choppy waters of home schooling, I needed something to pass the time. I had never had much luck with the apps but, this time, I connected with Bart, a Dutch PR manager who lived in Windsor. To begin with, I assumed our conversation would follow the same pattern as most of my chats on the apps – last a few days, then fizzle out. To my surprise, this time was different. Instead of ending in the great bin-fire of Hinge matches lost, a friendship grew. We began to have regular Zoom cinema nights – watching the same film online and chatting about it afterwards. As we got to know each other, I began to notice how kind and thoughtful he was, and I appreciated his interest in my life. Slowly I found myself opening up, something that had not happened for years.
Before the world turned upside down, I was happy with my single life. I have never wanted children, and spent my time with friends, occasionally dipping my toes into the murky pool of online dating. The process was always the same. Dates lasted an hour or two, before I would slink off home to catch up on Love Island. Every few years I would find that elusive spark but it was always with a charismatic, gym-honed banker who would allude to a string of heartbroken ex-girlfriends and send me aubergine emojis at 3am. I knew this penchant for unavailable men was unhealthy, but despite my efforts, I somehow never managed – or bothered – to break the cycle.

                    <span>Amid the complex web of international trade, proving the authenticity of a product can be near-impossible. But one company is taking the search to the atomic level
Five years ago, the textile giant Welspun found itself mired in a scandal that hinged on a single word: “Egyptian”. At the time, Welspun was manufacturing more than 45m metres of cotton sheets every year – enough to tie a ribbon around the Earth and still have fabric left over for a giant bow. It supplied acres of bed linen to the likes of Walmart and Target, and among the most expensive were those advertised as “100% Egyptian cotton”. For decades, cotton from Egypt has claimed a reputation for being the world’s finest, its fibres so long and silky that it can be spun into soft, luxurious cloth. In Welpsun’s label, the word “Egyptian” was a boast and a promise.
But the label couldn’t always be trusted, it turned out. In 2016, Target carried out an internal investigation that led to a startling discovery: roughly 750,000 of its Welspun “Egyptian cotton” sheets and pillowcases were made with an inferior kind of cotton that didn’t come from Egypt at all. After Target offered its customers refunds and ended its relationship with Welspun, the effects rippled through the industry. Other retailers, checking their bed linen, also found Welspun sheets falsely claiming to be Egyptian cotton. Walmart, which was sued by shoppers who had bought Welspun’s “Egyptian cotton” products, refused to stock Welspun sheets any more. A week after Target made its discoveries public, Welspun had lost more than $700m from its market value. It was cataclysmic for the company.

                    <span>The pandemic has forced many of us to rethink our lives, not least of which is how we work. For me, it meant returning home
Ten days before our birthday, I drove my 2005 blue Nissan Sentra over the Verrazano Bridge and let the tears roll out. He didn’t know it, but I was almost home. The Verrazano spills into Brooklyn, where Scott and I entered the world.
We were born a little after 11am on 28 July 1994 in Maimonides hospital, fraternal twins. “Two boychiks!” my father boasted, still in his blue scrubs, as he burst into the waiting room. The cheering section – two grandmas, two grandpas – erupted.

                    <span>When the ‘subscription social network’ OnlyFans announced it would be banning the sexually explicit content that made it a billion-dollar business, sex workers were up in arms – and many observers wondered how the move could make financial sense. Then it had second thoughts. So what does this tech saga tell us about where pornography fits into the future of the internet – and is it just another example of the sex industry treating women as disposable?
This episode includes discussion of sex and pornography.
OnlyFans bills itself as a wide-ranging ‘subscription social network’ where content creators of any kind can charge their followers to view their output – but in reality its hugely successful business is largely based around sex. That emphasis only grew during the pandemic, with more and more users spending their free time online – and more people wondering about a new source of income. With the company valued at about $1bn (£720m), and celebrities like Cardi B and Bella Thorne signing up, it was hard to see it doing anything other than more of the same.

The Guardian headline reads “PM’s ruthless reshuffle lays ground for next election”, and details how education secretary Gavin Williamson and foreign secretary Dominic Raab were the highest-profile victims.

Wednesday night’s successful launch marked the most ambitious leap yet in space tourism. It’s the first chartered passenger flight for Elon Musk’s space company and the first time a rocket streaked toward orbit with a crew that contained no professional astronauts.

A man described by US authorities as the world’s most prolific purveyor of child sexual abuse images at the time of his arrest in Ireland has been sentenced to 27 years in federal prison.
Eric Eoin Marques, 36, created and operated computer servers on the dark web that enabled users to anonymously access millions of illegal images and videos, many depicting the rape and torture of infants and toddlers. Law enforcement had never seen many of those images before finding them on Marques’ servers, according to prosecutors.

A US court has thrown out the third-degree murder conviction of the former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor for mistakenly killing the Australian woman Justine Damond.
Noor was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual US-Australian citizen who called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her home.

                    <span>2021’s contenders for the Riba new architecture award range from a mesmerising Cambridge masjid to flats a London council wanted bulldozed
A mesmerising wooden mosque in Cambridge will go head to head with a Cornish footbridge and a cluster of black boatsheds in the Lake District, in this year’s battle for the UK’s best new building. Joining them in the race for the 2021 Riba Stirling prize are a new student centre for Kingston University, a key worker housing development in Cambridge, and a controversial stone apartment block in London which was almost demolished by the local council.
The mosque is the list’s photogenic stunner, and the most likely to snatch the gong. Designed by Marks Barfield, architects of the London Eye ferris wheel, it applies hi-tech rigour to the creation of a beguiling glade of worship. A grid of tall tree-like columns branch outwards, weaving into a filigree structural canopy that undulates above the prayer hall, echoing the form of gothic stone vaults, and filtering daylight from circular openings above. Featuring Cambridge Gault clay brickwork, patterned with decorative Arabic Kufic inscriptions, and ablution facilities worthy of a luxury spa, the £23m building is a compelling fusion of local and Islamic traditions, creating a powerful prototype for what a modern British mosque might be.

It is easy to mock the Kremlin’s assassins. But until you have been one of Vladimir Putin’s henchmen, tasked with terminating your boss’s troublesome political rival by any means necessary (even comic ones), do you really know that you, too, wouldn’t have liberally rubbed a pair of underpants with novichok? Exactly. You don’t.
None of this should be taken as implying that Alexei Navalny was poisoned by Putin’s henchmen doing just that. After all, as Putin told reporters, if the FSB security agency had wanted to kill Navalny, they wouldn’t have bungled it.

Derby could agree nine-point reduction with EFL

Fulham returned to the top of the Championship with a comfortable 4-1 victory over Birmingham at St. Andrew’s.
Marco Silva’s side always looked in charge of the contest and two goals in each half backed up a dominant display. Denis Odoi ended a three-year wait for a league goal as his 10th-minute header put the visitors in front, with Aleksander Mitrovic’s 44th-minute penalty doubling Fulham’s advantage. Impressive debutant Nathaniel Chalobah won the spot-kick, and the deadline-day signing from Watford played a key role in the game’s third goal. The 26-year-old former Chelsea youngster cut open the Blues defence with a delightful pass which was finished off in equally clinical style by Harry Wilson in the 54th minute.

Alberto Salazar, the US distance coach who guided Mo Farah to four Olympic gold medals and six world titles, is understood to have lost his appeal against a series of doping violations.
Salazar had vowed to clear his name after being sanctioned in October 2019 and appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. But after a virtual hearing that lasted seven days in March his sanction was upheld and as a result he will have to serve his full four-year ban. Cas’s detailed explanation for its decision is expected shortly.

Things were even worse than they seemed. Liz Truss was looking positively chipper on the frontbench ahead of prime minister’s questions. Someone in No 10 had told her she was in line for a promotion in the imminent reshuffle. Uselessness was clearly a highly prized commodity in a Boris Johnson government. No one could cut and paste an existing trade deal and rebrand it as a new one quite like Truss. Not least because she genuinely believed she had achieved something remarkable.
Priti Patel initially wasn’t looking quite so relaxed. But that was because she had taken Boris’s description of the Home Office turning the UK into the “Saudi Arabia of penal policy” as a sign the prime minister thought she was going soft on crime. It had taken some persuading from Rishi Sunak, who was sitting beside her, that Boris had actually intended the remarks as a compliment. “You’ll be fine,” the chancellor had said. “You can’t be any dimmer than the health secretary who thinks you can’t get Covid off your friends and the prime minister really values the fact that you are as vicious as you are useless.”

With Paris Saint-German up next, City cannot afford a repeat against Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé, Neymar and co, who will surely watch the film of this and smell blood. Guardiola’s men were able to react each time they conceded but are bound to find it trickier against Mauricio Pochettino’s aristocrats.

                    <span>The Kop reminded Milan of Istanbul before kick-off with a banner that read: “25/05/05 – There are places I remember.” Their torment did not cease there. Liverpool rekindled 16-year-old memories on the pitch too with three goals, another comeback and another rollercoaster Champions League win.
There were lofty expectations for Group B from the moment a heavyweight draw was made. A high-octane, high quality opener at Anfield exceeded them. Milan initially received a brutal lesson in how elite European football has developed in the seven years since they were last in the Champions League as Jürgen Klopp’s side threatened to overwhelm Stefano Pioli’s team.

Aurora police department has a pattern of racially biased policing, Colorado’s attorney general said Wednesday, following a civil rights investigation that began amid outrage over the killing of Elijah McClain.
Attorney general Phil Weiser said the investigation found the department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color – especially Black people – differently than white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force; frequently escalates encounters with civilians; and fails to properly document police interactions with residents.

More than 140 workers have signed a petition addressed to Google executives calling on the company to “immediately pay back all Temps, Vendors and Contractors (TVCs) who have been knowingly underpaid by Google” and to “create an immediate path to permanent employment for temporary workers and end its two-tiered perma-temp system”.

Bradford-based performers use their passion for modified motors to explore the challenges faced by Muslim men in Britain today
There’s a striking moment in Peaceophobia when the cars – the scene-stealers of Common Wealth’s new show – start speaking back. While one of the performers tries to tell us the history of his beloved VW Golf, a voice from the vehicle interrupts with a chronicle of racism and Islamophobia in Britain. The founding of the BNP. The Bradford riots. The Prevent programme.
There’s a cruel irony here. For Bradford-based performers Ali Yunis, Casper Ahmed and Sohail Hussain – who wrote the show alongside poet and playwright Zia Ahmed – cars are both an escape and an unintended catalyst for harassment. The hours spent painstakingly perfecting their vehicles are a retreat from everyday pressures and prejudices, yet those same cars make these Muslim men a target for police officers and passersby.

The KNP Complex fire, composed of the Paradise and Colony fires, took hold in the dense, mountainous vegetation on 9 September. By Wednesday morning, the blaze had scorched more than 7,000 acres.

They were loudly patterned, buttery soft, interesting – clothing functional for chasing around young children, accommodating of changing bodies post-birth, and cute enough to be socially acceptable outside the home. The woman who advertised the leggings said she bought them wholesale from a company called LuLaRoe, and sold them for double the price.
Blevins was intrigued. She was struggling with the alienation of young motherhood and looking to supplement her family’s income, and LuLaRoe offered an alluring, soothing promise: sign up to be a retailer, and you could run a successful virtual boutique out of your home while still being present for your kids.

Analysis
Live updates

Boris Johnson has laid the groundwork for the next general election with a ruthless cabinet reshuffle, designed to clear out failing ministers and hand Michael Gove the key job of making “levelling up” a reality for sceptical voters.
On a day of dramatic developments in Westminster, Johnson sacked three cabinet ministers including the gaffe-prone education secretary Gavin Williamson, and shifted Dominic Raab from the Foreign Office to the Ministry of Justice. Liz Truss, the media-savvy darling of Conservative grassroots members and champion of free markets, will replace Raab as foreign secretary.

Cabinet reshuffle – live updates

For a man often said to be a people pleaser and conflict avoider, in his two years as prime minister Boris Johnson has sacked 27 cabinet ministers. His three reshuffles so far have been brutal, rejecting any attempt at a broad church.
Whitehall sources said the casualties were intended to put his ministers on notice about the prime minister’s strength of position. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, lost his job despite no discernible wrongdoing. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, was unceremoniously fired despite fears be could be a threat on the backbenches. One government source said all ministers “would know they are dispensable”.

Facebook should be punished with substantial fines, potentially running into billions of pounds, if it withholds evidence that its social media platforms harm users, according to the MP leading scrutiny of a new online safety bill.
The social network is under political pressure on both sides of the Atlantic following revelations in the Wall Street Journal that Facebook knew its Instagram photo-sharing app was harming the mental health of teenage girls. Leaked internal documents showed that among teenagers who have had suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram.

The prize for most undervalued flotation of the year goes to Darktrace. The Cambridge-based cyber security firm floated in April at 250p. Price now: an astonishing 731p. How does that happen? How does a £1.7bn valuation become £5bn in five months?
Well, the company has done its bit in by delivering the trading numbers it said it would, plus a bit more, which clearly helps the mood. The fresh news in Wednesday’s first set of full-year figures wasn’t the thumping headline loss of $149m (£108m). It was the second post-float upgrade in revenue forecasts for the year ahead.

The show item was a dead spotted lanternfly the boy had discovered at his home – an invasive moth-like bug that has been causing massive damage to plants in US eastern states but had not previously been thought to have reached Kansas.

Cummings, who was ordered by Boris Johnson to leave Downing Street in November, has applied to undertake consultancy work, according to correspondence from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).

                    <span>The government must stop trying to re-enact old battles with Brussels and focus instead on building new relations
It is usually worth paying more attention to what ministers do than what they say, especially when the subject is Europe. At the start of this week, the Brexit minister, David Frost, told the House of Lords that Britain was unafraid to invoke article 16 – the emergency suspension clause – of the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) that Boris Johnson signed with Brussels last year. Days later, the government deferred the introduction of customs controls on goods being imported from the continent.
The message is consistent to the extent that Lord Frost’s comments and waiving of border regulation both demonstrate that the UK was unready for Brexit on the terms it negotiated. But there is a difference between menacing rhetoric that is meant to assert UK power and policy action that surrenders border control.

                    <span>London politicians talk about creating ‘high streets for all’. The fate of two unique places will show whether they mean it
There are two places in London that would be the pride of any other major city in the world, yet which face an imminent threat to their survival. They are the Latin Village in Seven Sisters, and Banglatown in Spitalfields. Although there are big differences between the two, they also have much in common. Both are places renowned for their minority-ethnic population, both are in areas of historic deprivation and both are bursting at the seams with small independent businesses. Spitalfields and Seven Sisters have long been tough areas with high levels of poverty, but the ethnic minorities that have given London so much of its energy and interest have made them home – and made them hum. 
The “Indian” restaurants of Brick Lane (run mainly by men who originate from the Sylhet region of Bangladesh) are world famous, and in normal times draw hordes of tourists, as well as students and office workers. The broader area has grocery shops, textile sellers and tailors that cater to the large Bangladeshi community. It is, says Sean Carey of the University of Manchester, a co-author on a recent project called Beyond Banglatown, “totally unique: there is no other place like it in the world”.

Judges said there was a “reasonable basis” to believe that the crime against humanity of murder had been committed in the crackdown, which has killed as many as tens of thousands of people.

FBI accused of failing to investigate abuse properly

Simone Biles offered emotional testimony on Tuesday at a US senate hearing into the Larry Nassar abuse scandal, an episode that rocked the world of gymnastics and involved some of the most famous young athletes in America.
Nassar, a former USA Gymnastics team doctor, is serving an effective life sentence after abusing dozens of athletes under his care. Biles and other Olympic gold medalists such as Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney are among the survivors of the abuse. On Tuesday, they appeared in front of a senate committee to give searing testimony at the hearing into the FBI’s failed 2015 investigation into the case.

Trainer was suspended in March over photo with dead horse

For the first time since early March, a Gordon Elliott runner walked into a winner’s enclosure at Sligo on Wednesday as the Grand National-winning trainer recorded his first success after being banned from the sport for six months when a photograph emerged showing him posing astride a dead horse on his gallops.
Elliott saddled two favourites on the Sligo card and while The Sliding Rock (8-13) finished third of four earlier in the afternoon, Fancy Foundations, at even money, was a comfortable four-length winner of the Templehouse Lake Chase and returned to warm applause from the crowd.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, defeated a historic Republican-led recall effort, securing a victory that will probably save his political career and bolster the continuation of the Democrat’s policies.
Newsom on Tuesday easily fought back the attempt to remove him from office less than three years into his first term. Incomplete returns showed him heading toward a landslide win with about 65% of the vote.

More than 2,000 health workers across NSW, Victoria and the ACT are currently in isolation, placing more pressure on the remaining workforce as Covid cases continue to climb.
The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association says many health workers in that state’s hospitals are working shifts of up to 16 hours to cover the shortfall, while PPE issues have left some staff without access to “fit-tested” masks.

Jess Brammar, the former editor of HuffPost UK, was appointed executive editor of the BBC’s news channels, despite an attempt from a BBC board member to block the move. Brammar, who also worked as acting editor of BBC Newsnight, faced attacks in rightwing media outlets after she emerged as the leading candidate for the role.

Madonna appeared at the MTV VMAs dressed in an Atsuko Kudo latex ensemble, leather gloves and cap, while Kardashian wore a face-obscuring, all-black Balenciaga look at the Met Gala (an intentional nod to Kanye West’s recent style). At the same event, Gossip Girl actor Evan Mock wore a studded gimp mask from Thom Browne. So why have these niche outfits gone mainstream?

The report by King’s College London and the Université de Paris, based on polling carried out in April and May, found that cafe, club and restaurant closures, lockdowns and home working had not dented inhabitants’ enthusiasm for the two capitals.

“We fought France, we attacked France, we targeted the civilian population – but it was nothing personal against them,” Salah Abdeslam said of the coordinated gun and suicide bomb attacks across Paris on 13 November 2015, which began at the national football stadium, continued at bars and restaurants and ended with a massacre inside a rock gig at the Bataclan concert hall.

                    <span>The planned abolition of the £20 uplift is the latest attack on claimants caught in an unfair benefits system, says Mark Newbury. Plus letters from Jane Middleton and Manuela Gonnermann
Your editorial (14 September) is correct in highlighting the link between access to affordable social housing and childcare as a determining factor in childhood poverty. But with its focus on the imminent removal of the £20 per week uplift, it does not address two structural issues relating to universal credit. First, help with housing costs is restricted. Those living in rented accommodation – regardless of being in paid employment or not – face a cap on how much rent is taken into account under either the local housing allowance (for those in the private rented sector) or the “bedroom tax” (for those in social housing), with any shortfall met from the claimants’ income.
Second, there is “benefit capping”. The original benefit cap restricts entitlement to benefit (including help with rental costs) to a maximum amount per month and impacts larger families not in paid employment. A more insidious version, the two-child policy, removed the entitlement to any state support, bar child benefit, for a third and any subsequent child born after April 2017. The policy applies to families who are wholly benefit-dependant and to those in work. In real terms, it represents a cut in universal credit of up to £237.08 per child per month.

I doubt whether your headline (Bring in measures soon or risk 7,000 daily Covid hospitalisations, Sage warns, 14 September) will make any difference to the callousness shown by the government towards those dying from Covid every day.
Compared with the strict and effective approaches shown by other countries, it beggars belief that we are being told to “learn to live with Covid” when, since restrictions were prematurely lifted on 19 July, over 5,600 people have died and the death rate has now risen to almost 1,000 a week. There are a quarter of a million new infections a week, and we are being told that the effectiveness of the vaccinations is already beginning to wane and that booster jabs are now needed.

                    <span>The director’s latest film, in which he stars as a former rodeo star who travels to Mexico to save a friend’s son, is an inert disappointment
Cry Macho, the new 70s-set film from the world’s most prolific nonagenarian director, Clint Eastwood, has endured an almost 50-year journey to the screen, a journey that, after actually watching Cry Macho, is of far more interest than what’s ended up in front of us. After his screenplay was rejected in the 70s, writer N Richard Nash turned it into a novel before then pitching the exact same screenplay, which this time got bought by Fox. Eastwood was offered it in the late 80s but decided to star in The Dead Pool instead, while offering to direct Robert Mitchum in the role. In the 90s, Roy Scheider signed on but production was never completed. Over time, Pierce Brosnan and Burt Lancaster were also attached before in 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger picked it as his next role but stepped back when he became governor. As his term ended, he announced that it would be his next project but just as production was set to start, his affair with a household employee who bore his child caused it to fold.

Every one of the world’s leading economies, including all the countries that make up the G20, is failing to meet commitments made in the landmark Paris agreement in order to stave off climate catastrophe, a damning new analysis has found.
Less than two months before crucial United Nations climate talks take place in Scotland, none of the largest greenhouse gas emitting countries have made sufficient plans to lower pollution to meet what they agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate accord.

Sussex police have been accused of not fully investigating the death of Blessing Olusegun, from south London, who was found dead at Bexhill on 18 September 2020.

At some stage in the coming days, Emma Raducanu will return home with the US Open trophy safely packed away, a grand slam title winner at the age of 18. Together with a whistle-stop round of media commitments, which included a visit to the New York Stock Exchange, she has been congratulated by the Queen and in parliament and her stunning triumph in New York has captured the imagination of a nation, dominated the news on TV and radio. It’s a life-changing moment for Raducanu and for British tennis, it is a huge opportunity.
In the wake of her incredible success, Raducanu was quick to thank many of the people involved in her development, from Matt James, the coach who helped her most in recent years in Bromley, to the support of her family, who moved to Britain when she was aged two and who instilled the work ethic, drive and determination to accompany her innate talent.

Witnessing the mass movement of wild animals can seem to be a rebuttal of the disastrous news we hear, daily, of our natural environment.

In the past few days we’ve seen moving stories of massed southern right whales feeding off New South Wales. Only then, bitterly, to have the Dantean alternative presented to us, in the piles of bloody dolphin carcases on a quay in the Faroe Islands.

There is a great big plant outside the flats where I live that looks bewildered to find itself there. In Mexico, yes; west London, not so much. Its leaves look like the tongues of giant lizards, with prickly edges and nasty spikes at the tips. This summer, out of their ferocious midst, a thick stalk emerged suddenly and grew, almost overnight, to an astonishing height. There was a certain exhibitionist arrogance about this new weapon in its armoury. I admired it, but feared it a little, too.
Enquiries revealed the plant to be Agave americana. This species is commonly known as the century plant, although typically it lives for between 10 and 30 years. I read with great sadness that it sends up the magnificent, branched stalk only the once, as it comes to the end of its life.

Prices are climbing in the shops and consumers face an autumn crunch. Official figures show inflation rose at the fastest rate in a decade in August, as the impact of Covid-19 and Brexit drives up the cost of living.
Surpassing the forecasts of City economists, the 1.2 percentage point increase in the consumer price index was the largest since January 1997, the year Gordon Brown would later handthe Bank of England independence to manage inflation. At 3.2%, the CPI is now the highest since March 2012.

                    <span>Having made pivotal early contributions to civil rights and women’s liberation, the activist gets a blander documentary than they deserve
The new film from Betsy West and Julie Cohen, the directors of RBG, is about Pauli Murray (1910-1985), a Black activist whose contribution to the women’s liberation and civil rights movements in the US were crucial yet sorely under-documented. Murray’s legacy as a scholar, a lawyer, a poet and a priest is so vast that it seems near impossible to force labels on a life so fully lived. Charting the numerous milestones in their fight for justice, the documentary cements Murray’s status as a pivotal catalyst for change.
It all began when Murray was refused entry to the University of North Carolina, which at the time did not admit female students. The academically determined Murray proceeded to send numerous letters to then President Franklin D Roosevelt, decrying the shallowness of his progressive image. Such an audacious, courageous act embodies Murray’s fearlessness as an activist who engaged in acts of civil disobedience decades before the were part of an organised movement. Moreover, their work as a graduate student, which interpreted the 14th amendment as applicable to people across sex and race, was instrumental in later supreme court cases on equal protection. Underneath Murray’s professional confidence, however, was the aching turmoil of gender dysphoria, which led to bouts of painful depression.

Instant noodles, bulk quantities of rice, baked beans and toilet roll. Yes, I was totally prepared for my first year of university.
The uni adventure started, like most fun mistakes do, at freshers’ week. Fancy dress, spending way too much to see musician Example, and the chicken shop on the way home. More takeaway the next day, then back out again, six hedonistic days in a row.

Norm Macdonald, former SNL cast member, dies at 61

It was Frank Skinner who first brought my attention to Norm Macdonald. Years ago – I can’t remember how, as this was before YouTube – he showed me a clip of a matinee idol-looking man at the Montreal comedy festival, doing a bit about lying. But a very specific element of lying. “You ever lie for no reason at all?” he says, in his impossibly rootsy North American voice, crazily upbeat – which was so much part of his delivery, of his ability to charm but also to make the things he was talking about, often very familiar, become strange and new. “Someone says, ‘You seen that movie with Meryl Streep and the horse?’ And you go: ‘Ye…</span>

                    <span>We needed warmth and fun and ice lollies to prepare us for the coming gloom. We got … more gloom
I’ve been drenched in rain this week. Personally, I like it. I have a theory that everyone has a season that brings out the best in them, and for most normal people that is summer, because summer is good, but for me I like autumn: wearing boots, looking at clouds of fog, going in woods for a bit, having a hot chocolate. There is no better season in which to watch a really long film while turning on all the lamps in your house, for instance. Suddenly caring about hedgehogs. Casseroles. Going to a pub with a fireplace in it. All of that.
So for people like me (miserable; a lot of coats), autumn is good. For everyone else, not so much. More to the point, the blunt fact of autumn being here is that summer is over, and therein lies a problem: we didn’t have a summer this year, in a year when we really needed one. And I can only foresee this coming out in simmering, wrongheaded ways (oh, just say “British”!) over the next few weeks and months, and probably ruining the good early days of winter, too.

Paul Dacre should be banned from reapplying to be chair of media regulator Ofcom because he failed the interview process on the first attempt, according to the Conservative MP who runs an influential select committee.
Downing Street has been trying to appoint the former Daily Mail editor to run Ofcom’s board since last summer, where he would have ultimate oversight of broadcast regulation and social media rules. However, earlier this year Dacre unexpectedly failed the vetting process for the £142,500 job at the final interview stage, with those on the panel considering him to be “unappointable” as an impartial chairman.

                    <span>‘Adolescent great whites lurk in the depths waiting for seals. Then they launch themselves at the surface – and their sheer power takes them clear of the water’
There is no more iconic species on the planet than the great white shark. Everybody knows what they are, even in the most landlocked countries on Earth, and people are fascinated by them. The great white sharks at Seal Island, a few miles across the water from False Bay near Cape Town, use a surface hunting technique called breaching. They lurk in the depths waiting for seals porpoising along the waves, then launch themselves with incredible speed towards the surface. Their sheer power takes them clear of the water and results in these dramatic breaches that have become famous on documentary channels all across the world.
Sharks tend to hunt differently depending on their environment. In the Farallon Islands near San Francisco, they’ll bite off the flippers of seals and let them bleed out. But at Seal Island, certain environmental factors encourage this sort of aerial hunting. First, it’s the ideal topography: the shallows turn to depths quickly, meaning the sharks patrolling the deeper waters can surprise their prey. Stealth is key.

Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh

As the days become shorter and colder, and the country gets ready to head into autumn and then winter, two key questions I am repeatedly asked are: what will the next six months look like; and will there be another national winter lockdown?
We scientists are struggling with our crystal balls as we try to predict a future determined by complex interlocking factors. These include potential new variants; a resurgence of seasonal illnesses such as flu and RSV (a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms), putting pressure on the NHS; a vaccination programme that has proved effective but still requires greater uptake; and public fatigue.

                    <span>The Leeds punk rocker lived a double life, interspersing band rehearsals and punk gigs with twice-daily runs, despite the occasional arrest and moshpit injury. A new book tells his story
When Gary Devine was picked to run for England, the manager took one look at him and asked: “You’re gonna represent your country looking like that?!” Devine had turned up with shocking pink hair, holes in his jeans, a worn out band T-shirt and unlaced Doc Martens. Not that such a punky image stopped him becoming British fell running champion, after a race up Ben Nevis, the UK’s tallest mountain, in 1990. “Years later the manager told us that Gary had changed his life,” smiles Debbie Devine, Gary’s wife and coach. “He said ‘I learned not to judge a book by its cover.’”
Thirty one years on, Devine’s wonderful and often very funny story is told in a new book, Faster! Louder! How a Punk Rocker from Yorkshire Became British Champion Fell Runner. Author Boff Whalley was previously vocalist/guitarist in Leeds anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba, but is a fell runner too. “I got into it after seeing Gary win a race and recognising him from punk gigs,” he says as we all convene on Zoom. “It made me think ‘I could do that’. But Gary’s story is more extreme than mine. It needed writing.”

Sadly, however, if you can’t tolerate gluten, chocolate chip cookies do not usually love you back – while squidgy brownies and many other deliciously squidgy cakes don’t really suffer for a lack of this natural glue, it’s harder to keep a biscuit together without it. Harder, yes, but not impossible. (Incidentally, today’s recipe is dedicated to my godson, who is currently awaiting the results of a test for coeliac disease and relieved to find that, whatever happens, there are still cookies in his future.)

                    <span>Decades-old video game consoles such as Atari 2600, Mega Drive and NES are seeing a wave of new games released on old-school cartridges. Who’s making them, and why?
This year, veteran video game developers Garry Kitchen and David Crane released a new game for the Atari 2600 – despite the fact that the console was discontinued some 30 years ago. And they’re not the only ones. Companies such as Limited Run Games and Strictly Limited Games are manufacturing brand new cartridges, and sometimes never-before-released games, for consoles that predate the smartphone. “The market’s not remotely dead for these consoles,” says Josh Fairhurst, head of North Carolina-based Limited Run. “There’s a lot of demand, and it’s only growing.”
Prices for retro games have gone through the roof in recent years, as evidenced by a recent slew of record-breaking auction bids for classic titles, including the sale of a mint copy of Super Mario 64 for $1.5m (£1.1m). The supply of old games is limited, and demand is increasing: not just from older people who want to collect games they remember from their youth, but also from those who weren’t even born when the Sega Mega Drive was cutting-edge. “New generations want to go back and experience the classics and own them,” says Fairhurst. “There are game collectors born every day.”

                    <span>Her daughter says Joan Blass was 87 and had dementia when a man befriended her, then married her quietly, inherited her estate when she died – and buried her in an unmarked grave. Now Franks works tirelessly to make such marriages a crime
According to Daphne Franks, her mother was 87 when she met Colman Folan. He passed by when Joan Blass was trimming her hedge, the two got talking and she invited him in. Even this was out of character for Blass, says Franks, who lived about 30 metres from her mother in Leeds. She would once have been a bit more cautious, but Blass had been widowed three years earlier and diagnosed with vascular dementia.
“I remember her saying at the time: ‘There are a few old ladies he visits,’” says Franks, 64. “That rang alarm bells. I wish I’d listened to them.”

The NWMI (Network of Women in Media, India) has launched a print sale, with all images donated by the Associated Press, to raise funds to help those journalists with evacuations and resettlement, to rebuild their lives, and to tell their stories

I was in the back of the back of beyond: a wilderness camp in a lonely north-eastern corner of the Australian continent known by the acronym FNQ: far north Queensland. To reach it, you had to leave a paved road, drive on to a barge, cross a river along which alligators loitered with malevolent intent, and then head north into the density of the rainforest foliage.
The camp was six huts on stilts with a general dining and bar area. Its owner was named Mal: an amiable, “good on you, mate” fellow in his late 50s. His wife, Alison, immediately struck me as shy and hyperstressed. Mal had been a builder in Brisbane. The camp was his retirement project. I was one of only three guests there. I sensed: trouble in paradise.

“Cake” was mentioned 10 times more often on UK television shows than “climate change” in 2020, data has revealed. The research showed “banana bread” was a more frequently heard term than “wind power” and “solar power” combined.
The report, from albert, a Bafta-backed sustainability project, also found that individual action, such as recycling, was far more frequently featured than issues that are much bigger drivers of the climate crisis such as energy and transport.

                    <span>Protein has gone from a niche bodybuilding supplement to a mainstream obsession – and is now added to a huge range of food and drink products. What led to the sudden growth of this multimillion-dollar industry?
At the Protein Pick and Mix store in Tunbridge Wells, you can have any snack you like, as long as it comes with extra protein. Protein pancakes, protein burger buns, protein muffins, protein nachos, protein croissants. Protein bars, of course, in every conceivable flavour: caramel millionaire’s shortbread, New York cheesecake, mint chocolate chip, double chocolate fudge, lemon drizzle, cinnamon swirl. White chocolate chip cookies that incorporate something called a “high protein lean matrix”.
I am being shown around the store and warehouse by the founder, Anthony Rodgers, 36, who has the well-defined musculature of a man who regularly eats three protein bars a day. He started the business, originally as an online shop, in 2013, after observing the trend for exotically flavoured protein bars in the US. “At the time I was an avid gym-goer,” he says, “and protein bars were just starting to be a little more creative, a little more exciting. People were putting actual effort into the flavours, and it started to transcend the boring, functional: ‘we’re just going to ram some protein in you.’”

Stir for a few seconds, then add a tin of baked beans, plus a slug of tomato ketchup. Heat and eat with toast. Believe me, it’s surprisingly good.

                    <span>The government’s plan to fix the ailing social care system passed into law this week. But who will benefit most and who will pick up the bill?
Last week Boris Johnson outlined what Downing Street is billing as a once-in-a-generation shake-up of adult social care and how it is funded. It is an attempt to tackle one of the thorniest issues in modern politics – how to meet the spiralling costs of an ageing population who are living longer with complex conditions and to do it in a way that people feel is fair.
Rachel Humphreys met one woman, Lesley, who knows only too well the complexity and expense of England’s social care system. She has helped her 90-year-old mother to sell her home to pay for her continuing residential care. It’s a story that will be familiar to families across the country who have had to grapple with a labyrinthine system that can quickly burn through a lifetime’s savings.

Californians are heading into the final hours of a recall election to determine whether the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, will retain his office, as a closely watched race with national reverberations draws to a close.
As only the second gubernatorial recall effort in California’s history to make it on to the ballot, the election represents a rare chance for Republicans to seize control in a deep blue state.

A Missouri cave containing Native American artwork from more than 1,000 years ago was sold at auction Tuesday, disappointing leaders of the Osage Nation who hoped to buy the land to “protect and preserve our most sacred site”.
A bidder agreed to pay US$2.2m to private owners for what’s known as “Picture Cave,” along with the 43 hilly acres that surround it near the town of Warrenton, about 60 miles (97km) west of St Louis.

The culture secretary has reiterated his belief that Channel 4 would benefit from a change of ownership, in the latest indication that the government intends to push ahead with privatisation of the state-owned broadcaster.
“I believe that if Channel 4 wants to grow then at some point soon it will need cash,” he will tell the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge on Wednesday. “It can either come on the back of the taxpayer, or it can come from private investment. And it’s my strong position – as a point of principle – that I do not believe the borrowing of a commercial TV channel should be underwritten by a granny in Stockport or Southend.”

The three men, Marc Baier, Ryan Adams, and Daniel Gericke, are accused of having been part of a clandestine unit named Project Raven, first reported by Reuters, that helped the United Arab Emirates spy on its enemies.

Seven actors share 42 roles in Rebecca Taichman’s stunning production of Paula Vogel’s Tony award-winner about a controversial queer Yiddish play
Contemporary plays can fall into intriguing conversation. Covering the same five decades of Jewish history as Tom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt, Paula Vogel’s Tony award-winner Indecent also begins with a controversial text being privately read in a European household. Stoppard starts in 1900 Vienna with characters scandalised by the Schnitzler script that became La Ronde; Vogel sets out from 1907 Poland with a dining-table read of God of Vengeance, a drama by a young Yiddish writer, Sholem Asch.
Now almost unknown, but globally successful enough to have reached Broadway in 1923, Asch’s work attracted opposing intolerance – antisemites finding it too Jewish, orthodox worshippers not Jewish enough – but thematically it was precociously tolerant. A lesbian love story sub-plot – the first on the American stage – brought US courts and Senate to the stage door.

Ben Brereton Diaz scores fourth of season as Blackburn win

Dominic Solanke’s fifth goal of the season helped Bournemouth to end QPR’s unbeaten record following a 2-1 win in the Championship. The Cherries’ victory sent them joint-top of the table and extends their own unbeaten start after West Brom could only draw 0-0 at home against Derby.
Bournemouth and QPR were two of three teams in the division still yet to lose before the match at the Vitality Stadium, but the visitors made a poor start on the south coast. The centre-back Rob Dickie was easily dispossessed by Jaidon Anthony and the Cherries youngster proceeded to fire home after 12 minutes.

                    <span>Romelu Lukaku had been the subject of suffocating attention from a well-organised and robust Zenit St Petersburg central defensive three. Everywhere he turned, it felt as though a door was slammed in his face and, as this tie entered its final stretch, the visitors had to be starting to think they had him and Chelsea under control.
But it takes only one second for Lukaku to break free. It takes him only one move or moment to mete out the harshest punishment. It is the reason why Chelsea dug so deep to re-sign him over the summer and it was the reason why they were able to make a winning start to their Champions League defence.

It was not eight, not this time, but it was not great. Two goals from Robert Lewandowski and one from Thomas Müller completed a 3-0 victory that was more about the visitors’ overwhelming superiority than it was about the numbers.

                    <span>The story of the girl band that conquered the world gets a 2021 twist in this brilliant docuseries that goes way beyond ‘zig-a-zig-ah’ nostalgia
The team behind 2019’s outstanding documentary series Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain has turned its gaze back to the 1990s with Spice Girls: How Girl Power Changed Britain (Channel 4). It has put together a fabulously entertaining look at the girl band that conquered the world, placing their story in the cultural context of its own time, while putting it through its paces from a 2021 perspective. 
There are archive news clips, rarely seen home-video footage and interviews with those on the inside (though not the group themselves), which makes this feel intimate and close. It begins with an open audition for the film Tank Girl, in 1994, attended by the journalist and broadcaster Miranda Sawyer. Sawyer recalls two other young women in attendance: Geri Halliwell and Victoria Adams. Three months later, at another audition for a nascent pop group, their lives would change for good.
It whizzes through the origin story. We see them interviewed on The Big Breakfast, where they talk about how they were friends from the audition circuit who decided to move in together and form a band (a massaging of the truth, designed to make them seem more “authentic” in an age where that still mattered). That feels quaint in itself. Chris Herbert, who had the idea for a girl band who were “more street and cred” than Take That, decided they should live together. It might have been his biggest mistake. Footage from the house shows that their chemistry and charisma were instant, and they seem largely untameable and practically unmanageable. Before they even signed a record deal, they ditched Herbert and did a runner in Geri’s car.

                    <span>Burundian runner breaks 2,000m world record in Zagreb
Niyonsaba is an athlete with difference in sexual development

Track and field history was made in Zagreb on Tuesday night as Francine Niyonsaba became the first athlete who has identified herself as having a difference of sex development (DSD) to officially break a world record.
The Burundian did it in style, shattering the old 2,000m best by more than two seconds as she crossed the line in 5:21.26. While the 2,000m is not run frequently, Niyonsaba’s performance will inevitably reignite the debate over athletes with DSDs, given they are barred from competing internationally between 400m and 1600m unless they take medication to reduce their high testosterone.

Apple’s iPhone 13 will hit shelves later this month, with prices starting at $699 (£679 in the UK), the company announced at a press event on Tuesday.
A light update from last year’s iPhone 12, the new devices feature upgraded cameras and the company’s latest A15 chip, which it says is up to 50% faster than the competition.

Only 10 Tory MPs rebelled against the government’s introduction of a manifesto-busting tax increase to fund social care reforms and the NHS backlog caused by Covid.
The 1.25 percentage point national insurance hike for workers and employers was announced last week by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a means to raise £12bn. The bill for the “health and social care levy” was introduced on Tuesday and was rushed through the Commons in a single day.

A growing wildfire, sparked by lightning and spread through the dense, dry, forested Sierra Nevada, is posing dangers to the ancient sequoia trees in their namesake national park.
The Paradise fire and the Colony fire, which have burned together to become the KNP Complex fire, surged through more than 3,000 acres of steep and difficult-to-reach terrain since igniting on 9 September in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, with 0% containment by Tuesday morning.

• Story contains graphic image that some may find distressing.
Even the staunchest defenders of traditional whaling in the Faroe Islands have condemned the “cruel and unnecessary” massacre on Sunday of a superpod of nearly 1,500 dolphins, which were driven into shallow waters of the Skálabotnur beach on the island of Eysturoy and left writhing for hours before being killed.
The Sea Shepherd group, which has been campaigning to stop the traditional Faroese “Grind” hunt since the 1980s, has claimed Sunday’s hunt was “the largest single killing of dolphins or pilot whales in the islands’ history”, with more animals perishing than in an entire season at the infamous “Cove” at Taiji, Japan.

The 47-year-old singer had agreed to be interviewed for the film Jagged but has released a statement to express disappointment in how her story has been told. She said she was interviewed “during a very vulnerable time” during her third postpartum depression amid lockdown.

Norm Macdonald, the Canadian stand-up comic and Saturday Night Live cast member known for his deadpan delivery, died of cancer Tuesday at age 61.
The comedian had been living with cancer in private for nearly a decade, according to his longtime friend and producing partner Lori Jo Hoekstra, who was with him when he died. “He was most proud of his comedy,” Hoekstra told Deadline. “He never wanted the diagnosis to affect the way the audience or any of his loved ones saw him. Norm was a pure comic. He once wrote that ‘a joke should catch someone by surprise, it should never pander.’ He certainly never pandered. Norm will be missed terribly.”

                    <span>It was 20 minutes after the final whistle but nobody in yellow and black was going anywhere: not the players, not the staff and certainly not the 30,000 Young Boys fans, who jumped and stamped and rejoiced in a victory that will go down as one of their greatest ever. Meanwhile, in the opposite corner of the stadium, the last small sliver of Manchester United fans was filtering towards the exits, a night of indignities and humiliations finally complete.
A draw would have been fine. Annoying perhaps, especially after scoring early, but certainly manageable in the long term. And for all their bungling and blundering, a draw was what United had secured as the ball rolled towards Jesse Lingard in the fifth minute of injury time. But inexplicably Lingard decided to play the ball straight into the path of Young Boys substitute Jordan Siebatcheu, and in a twinkling United were defeated. They are now – already – in a scrap for qualification.

Neil finally confirmed he would be stepping down as chairman and lead presenter on Monday night, just three months after he helped launch the channel and having presented only eight of the 52 episodes of his flagship show. His announcement, which came after weeks of rumours of Neil’s discontentment, has left many of the station’s staff pondering their future.

                    <span>The film adaptation of the Tony-winning musical can’t overcome its 27-year-old star’s creepy teen makeup and the story’s wobbly handling of mental health
There are two major issues that Dear Evan Hansen, the film adaptation of the Tony-winning Broadway musical, cannot overcome. First, the decision to have Ben Platt reprise his Tony-winning performance as Evan Hansen in the film, the only original cast member to do so. (It seems relevant to mention that Platt’s father is a producer on the film; as Platt said earlier this year in defense of the casting: “Were I not to do the movie, it probably wouldn’t get made.”) It would’ve been one thing for the film-makers to have asked audiences to suspend disbelief that the 27-year-old Platt was actually a geeky high school senior – a little annoying, but fine, as almost every teen movie demands that anyway (see: Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls, Jesse Metcalfe in John Tucker Must Die, both in their late 20s). But the team behind Dear Evan Hansen put Platt in prosthetics and opaque, pasty makeup, along with a curly mop of hair, that strands the actor firmly in the uncanny valley. But the attempt to make Platt seem younger somehow renders him both older and inhuman – an act of near-sabotage so distracting it basically renders the movie unrecoverable.

Call it an embarrassment of riches at JD Sports. Profits, like the share price, are flying, to the point where the company predicts £750m for the full-year, or £150m more than the City had expected, which must be the largest profit upgrade ever announced by a UK retailer.
The embarrassment, or difficulty, lies in the fact that JD accepted a large helping hand from the public purse – notably £61m in UK furlough cash – and is keeping its Covid support, a stance that looks increasingly hard to sustain.

                    <span>Booster jabs and vaccines for older children are not a cure-all. The government should be taking other measures to keep us safe this year
As winter approaches, the good news is that we are in better shape than many people feared given the scrapping of almost all Covid restrictions over the summer. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warns that we are entering a period of uncertainty, but says that we are increasingly unlikely to reach January’s peak again. The bad news is that we are in worse shape than many people realise – and the government’s plan once more falls short.
A year ago, no one was vaccinated – now 80% of over-16s have had two jabs. But hospitalisations and deaths are many times higher than this time last year. On Tuesday, 26,628 new cases were reported and 185 deaths. The impact of the return of schools – which has produced a marked increase in infections in Scotland – and of universities will soon be felt. A Sage subgroup judges it “highly likely that a significant decrease in homeworking in the next few months would result in a rapid increase in hospital admissions”. As the weather worsens, people are more likely to mingle indoors. Winter viruses such as flu, norovirus and RSV are already surging; their impact may be worse this year because they were previously suppressed by lockdowns. Exhausted NHS staff are playing catch-up with the backlog created by the pandemic.

Between 2,000 and 7,000 people a day could be hospitalised with Covid in England next month unless the government urgently implements a “basket of measures”, government scientific advisers have warned as Boris Johnson made clear he hopes to avoid fresh restrictions.
The prime minister confirmed on Tuesday that Covid passports, the return of mandatory mask-wearing and advice to work from home would be kept in reserve as the government’s “plan B”, to be introduced if the NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed.

Rishi Sunak has given his blessing to a multibillion-pound trend that has seen foreign private equity firms snap up British businesses, describing the buying spree as “good news” for the economy.
The chancellor was speaking at the launch of Treasury Connect, an event intended to bring together fast-growing tech businesses with investors and politicians to spur innovation in areas such as fintech and life sciences.

The investigation into the assassination of the Haitian president Jovenel Moïse has taken a sensational turn after the country’s chief prosecutor asked a judge to charge Haiti’s prime minister in connection with the crime.
Ariel Henry, a 71-year-old neurosurgeon, became Haiti’s principal leader in July, two weeks after Moïse was killed at his home in the capital Port-au-Prince.

                    <span>A U-turn on the £20 universal credit cut is unlikely. But a new battle to protect low-income households has begun
The government appears hellbent on inflicting immeasurable hardship. Ignoring warnings, pleas and recommendations from charities, thinktanks, opposition parties and six former Conservative welfare secretaries, Rishi Sunak seems determined to withdraw the £20 weekly uplift in universal credit payments. The chancellor’s move will start hitting people’s pockets in three weeks’ time.
The government’s research points to “catastrophic” consequences from the decision to reduce the incomes of around 1m households by 10%. In around 400 constituencies, more than one-third of families with children will be affected. What makes a bad policy worse is the disingenuous lines that ministers have chosen to try to sell it. The suggestion from the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, that claimants could work “about two hours’ extra” each week to make up for the loss, was quickly exposed as nonsense. The way that benefits are calculated for working claimants means that to repair a £20 hole in household finances would require a single adult on UC to work an extra day, or shift. But the government appears committed to a narrative that falsely paints work as the virtuous alternative to benefits.

Prof Chris Whitty has said those spreading myths about Covid-19 vaccines “should be ashamed” as he dismissed a tweet by rapper Nicki Minaj which claimed that her cousin’s friend was rendered impotent after the jab caused swelling in his testicles.
When asked about the musician making the baseless claim to her vast online following, England’s chief medical officer said it was important to stress that the overwhelming majority of people were ignoring unfounded stories about the vaccines.

Finding dolls creepy has a long and storied past, from the actual phobia of dolls (pediophobia) to the generally accepted theory that dolls are often unsettling due to the “uncanny valley” effect. There are museums devoted to collecting horrible little mannequins. There are movie franchises about bad dolls that will kill you and your family. And for the past couple of years I’ve been in a private Facebook group called Spooky Doll Hour – and somehow the spooky dolls are the least weird thing about it.

It is natural that people who campaign for a political party and identify with its history treat its traditions with a certain reverence. It is also a pattern in British politics that effective party leaders – the ones who win elections – handle those traditions roughly.
That is why Boris Johnson is not overly concerned that many Tories think his “health and social care levy” betrays their sacred low-tax creed. He hears the complaint as proof that he belongs in the pantheon of prime ministers who brought new categories of believer to their parties. There could be no Thatcherites without Margaret Thatcher, no Blairites without Blair.

                    <span>An extra £12bn a year will do nothing to fix the mess of England’s privatised care system – but it will benefit big providers

Allyson Pollock is clinical professor of public health at Newcastle University

The government’s health and social care levy bill is being rushed through parliament today, in one day and with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. The bill would create a new tax to generate additional funding of around £12bn a year for health and social care, but does nothing to address the mess of England’s privatised care system and its fundamental weaknesses. Put simply, the bill is just a massive bailout for multinational care companies.
Social services for community and long-stay care in the UK are among the most privatised and fragmented in the western world – even more so than in the US. Local authorities in England commission most of their care services from private providers, of which there are 14,800 registered organisations providing care across 25,800 locations. This situation arose as local authorities, facing budget shortages and central government-imposed regulatory and financial incentives, sold off their care homes and turned to outsourcing. Scotland and the other devolved administrations face similar structural issues.

England struck out solo after home-nations bid stalled

The Rugby Football Union has confirmed its intention to bid to host the 2031 World Cup as part of a long-term vision also designed to ensure England are consistently in the top two in the rankings, as outlined by the new chair, Tom Ilube.
World Rugby’s council is due to vote on the host nations for the 2027 and 2031 tournaments next May with candidates due to formally submit bids by January. Australia are favourites to be awarded the 2027 World Cup while the USA is also interested in bidding for either edition.

The new Chinese ambassador to the UK has been barred from parliament by the Speakers in the Commons and Lords after the imposition of sanctions on British MPs by Beijing.
The new ambassador, Zheng Zeguang, was due to attend a meeting of the broadly pro-Chinese all-party group on China, but after a letter from MPs who were subjected to sanctions by China, including the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has said the meeting is not appropriate.

                    <span>There is a lack of political will to solve the chronic shortage of mental health beds, writes James Downs, while Adrian Ward says successive cuts have decimated children’s services
The distressing story of children being admitted to general wards because mental health beds aren’t available (Sharp rise in acute medical beds occupied by children with nowhere else to go, 13 September) is a story that’s been told time and again, including in my own life as someone who has lived with an eating disorder since my teens.
As a child, I was admitted to a paediatric ward with anorexia, but never saw a member of staff who specialised in mental health. As a young adult, I was on many general wards as a result of overdoses or eating disorder symptoms, but was always discharged without ever seeing a psychiatrist. It shouldn’t be a surprise that as an adult, I live with entrenched mental health problems that could have been prevented with the right care when I was younger. This is a hugely false economy played out in the lives of so many people.

                    <span>To meet climate promises, Boris Johnson must redirect billions from biomass energy into real renewables, says Elly Pepper
I was pleased to read your article exposing government bias against genuine renewables (UK ministers ‘met fossil fuel firms nine times as often as clean energy ones’, 10 September). The dirty energy industry still has Boris Johnson’s government completely under its thumb, despite the climate and biodiversity crises we are facing.
Over the past year, Johnson has repeatedly promised to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. Yet the UK remains Europe’s top subsidiser of biomass electricity, which is made by logging our planet’s forests and burning the trees in power stations. Enormous sums of money flow to Drax and others because the UK has wrongly defined biomass energy as “green” despite the objection of scientists, communities and public interest organisations. The reality is that just like burning fossil fuels, burning trees for electricity pumps enormous amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and exacerbates climate change. It also results in the logging of forests that we need to suck up and store carbon, threatens wildlife, harms vulnerable communities and emits deadly air pollution.

                    <span>The Irish directors of #MeToo nail-biter Rose Plays Julie explain why it’s their most accessible film yet – and how Aidan Gillen was initially not keen to play its sex offender celebrity archaeologist
Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor are chatting away over Zoom. The Irish film-makers, who are married, have worked together since the late 80s, when they were part of the experimental theatre scene in Dublin. In 2008, they made their first film, the micro budget Helen, about a young woman taking part in a police reconstruction. Shot in long takes at glacial pace, it featured non-professionals speaking their lines with a highly stylised anti-realist delivery. It was so unnerving, it pushed even lovers of art films out of their comfort zones.
So I’m braced for an intellectual barrage. But they turn out to be anything but austere or po-faced. Molloy, speaking from the front room of the London flat they share with their 18-year-old daughter, is thoughtful and wryly funny. Lawlor seems the more extrovert, wisecracking, effing and blinding, and name-checking Euripides.

                    <span>Petrifying young women still in the earliest stages of working out who they might become stymies their potential for growth
According to the commentators, Emma Raducanu’s triumph at the US Open is just the start. She has been hailed as a sporting saviour, a model of resilience, an antidote to xenophobia and a potential money-making powerhouse. Her historic victory has unwittingly entered her into a game that she can never win: the cultural obsession with exceptional teenage girls and young women.
Taking teenage girls seriously – beyond their commercial potential – is a shockingly recent phenomenon, a decade old if that. Earlier teen-girl prodigies, from Emily Dickinson to Beyoncé, were accused of being the puppets of powerful men and subject to exploitation. That was until social media gave a generation an unmediated voice to define their own culture, to fight against injustices they cared about and to speak out about the pressures and mistreatment they experienced.

Klopp impressed with Raducanu’s humble reaction to triumph

Jürgen Klopp has described Emma Raducanu as “the talent of the century” and admitted he was overwhelmed by the 18-year-old’s sporting reaction to winning the US Open.
The Liverpool manager is a keen tennis player and interrupted his preparations for Sunday’s 3-0 win at Leeds to watch the teenager make history on Saturday as the first qualifier to win a grand slam title. While impressed by the performance, Klopp said he was most inspired by the response of Raducanu and the defeated Leylah Fernandez to the result and believes their humility is an example to all elite sportspeople.

News that Andrew Neil is to leave GB News as lead presenter and chairman was, in typical fashion, broken a while ago and by reporters for outlets other than GB News. It’s a shame the station’s journalists weren’t first to this revelation, and should arguably be grounds for disciplinary measures. The Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie once sacked the paper’s astrologer with a pointed note reading: “As you will no doubt have foreseen … You’re fired.” Anyway, we’ll come to what its own self-styled newshounds failed to foresee about GB News shortly.
For now, pour yourself a rolling daiquiri, because Neil has officially quit, having hosted precisely eight editions of his supposedly flagship nightly show on the channel since it launched three months ago. Or rather, he has “had time to reflect on [his] extensive portfolio of interests”, which reads like the sort of preposterously self-regarding nonspeak the channel keeps telling you it’s against. I believe this is metro elite for: “Face it, this bed’s been shat, and I need to get out of it.”

Joe Biden will reportedly propose a target for 70% of the world’s population to be vaccinated within the next year at a global vaccines summit he intends to convene alongside the UN general assembly in New York this month.
The US president’s target, reported by the New York Times, is in line with ambitions set jointly by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the WTO and the World Health Organization (WHO) but is more ambitious than current performance and the targets set at the G7 meeting in Cornwall chaired by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson. The G7 agreed to donate 870m doses of Covid-19 vaccines directly, with an aim to deliver at least half by the end of 2021.

Schools that prioritised sending food parcels to their poorest pupils during lockdown in England may not have been able to focus on providing an education to all their students, the head of Ofsted has claimed.
Amanda Spielman said it was “admirable” for staff to focus on children who were in greatest need when the pandemic first hit, but this may have had consequences for the calibre of learning a school was able to provide for all children.

                    <span>We’re interested to hear what people think of the decision to roll out booster jabs to all those 50 and over and those at high risk of getting ill with Covid in the UK
From next week, the NHS will be offering booster jab against Covid-19 to all over-50s and those at high risk of the disease in the UK, as part of the government’s “toolbox” of measures for controlling coronavirus over the autumn and winter months.
The move comes following guidance from the government’s vaccine advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), who said a third dose of vaccine would top up the immunity in those whose protection had likely waned after getting fully jabbed earlier in the year.

                    <span>There are no simple solutions to Covid, but children themselves will, on balance, benefit from being vaccinated

Russell Viner is a paediatrician and professor at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health

The UK’s four chief medical officers (CMOs) have recommended that Covid-19 vaccinations be offered to all children aged 12 to 15. The the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), that guides vaccination decisions, originally advised that there were insufficient medical grounds to recommend vaccination of healthy 12- to 15-year-olds without other medical conditions –  in other words that the margin of benefit was too small to make it worthwhile. But the CMOs were asked by the secretary of state for health and social care to also consider possible benefits for education and mental health – issues beyond the JCVI’s remit.
Decisions about vaccinating children have multiple moving parts. We must balance the risks and benefits of vaccination for the young person themselves, while at the same time considering the ethical issues involved in securing an overall increase in the vaccination rate of wider society by vaccinating children – a group who are less likely to experience serious Covid symptoms themselves.

I miss biscuits, flapjacks and other treats, and I’m bored with squares of chocolate. 
Sam, Brighton
“Our flourless chocolate cake is our top seller – people are obsessed with it,” says Jessica Elliott Dennison, owner of Edinburgh neighbourhood kitchen Elliott’s. “What’s nice is it just happens to be gluten-free.” Heading down the naturally gluten-free path is a good idea, because, let’s face it, it just makes life easier, and Dennison’s chocolate cake couldn’t be simpler to knock up: “Melt dark chocolate, butter and a pinch of salt, cool slightly, then throw in cocoa powder and soft brown sugar.” Whisk, crack in eggs, and now you can take it in whatever direction you fancy – add espresso, citrus zest, vanilla or nuts, say – then bake until slightly risen. “I’ve also discovered that if you put the leftovers in the freezer, it tastes like Ben &amp; Jerry’s chocolate fudge brownie ice-cream.” Enough said.

Almost 90% of the $540bn in global subsidies given to farmers every year are “harmful”, a startling UN report has found.
This agricultural support damages people’s health, fuels the climate crisis, destroys nature and drives inequality by excluding smallholder farmers, many of whom are women, according to the UN agencies.

Nineteen months after its original release date, the 25th James Bond film will finally be seen in cinemas at the end of the month. It was the first major film to be postponed at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; many are banking on its eventual appearance marking an end to deep industry uncertainty.
The film itself is still, remarkably, swathed in mystery. Five years after the capture of Christoph Waltz’s Blofeld, Bond has retired to Jamaica, but is then enlisted by CIA pal Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) to help search for a missing scientist.

Cornflakes are, arguably, not the most exciting breakfast offering.

However, when you start adding cornflakes to other food, it’s a different story. Here are 10 fantastic cornflake recipes that are appealing enough to have John Harvey Kellogg spinning in his austere grave.

As a Kenyan from a farming community that has experienced the ravages of the climate crisis, no one is keener to see a successful climate summit held in Glasgow than me. But this year, due to restrictions placed by the pandemic on those attending from the global south, I fear Cop26 will not be a success. It is because of this that it must be postponed until next spring.
The UK government is aware of the issues facing those wishing to attend the conference in person, which is why it has offered vaccines to delegates unable to receive them in their home countries and to pay for their hotel quarantine. However, obstacles still remain. The vaccine rollout has been slow, and for those receiving the AstraZeneca jab, the deadline for receiving both doses within eight to 12 weeks of the conference starting has passed.

                    <span>As 22 states pass or consider legislation on race and racism discourse in classrooms, some Black teachers are reminded daily that their racial identity is a liability
History teacher Valanna White filed into the auditorium the first week of August for the customary back-to-school all-staff meeting at Walker Valley high school in Cleveland, Tennessee. What she heard shifted her outlook for the coming school year. On 1 July, a new law took effect banning the teaching of critical race theory in Tennessee public schools. White listened intently as a school district official gave a vague overview informing the group that critical race theory was prohibited, though without fully explaining what critical race theory entails. Instead, teachers were told a list of actions – such as discussing racial discrimination – that were forbidden. 
White left the meeting confused and frustrated. Tennessee’s academic standards for US history require high school teachers to cover topics including Jim Crow laws, Plessy v Ferguson – the 1896 supreme court case upholding the separate-but-equal doctrine – and the civil rights movement. “I can’t talk about the civil rights movement without talking about Bloody Sunday and the premise behind Bloody Sunday, the premise behind voter suppression,” she said, dreading the repercussions “for just teaching my standards”.

When I married my husband, one of the conditions was: no pornography. We have been married 25 years. In 2018, I discovered my husband had been watching porn regularly for six years. I found out because it gave him erectile dysfunction. He said he would give it up, which he did for 18 months. Then he started again. I was furious. We went to counselling. My husband only wants to have what I consider lazy sex. He wants sex only when he wakes up with an erection. I have told him that it is important to me to make love and have sex at night, too. I am concerned the past long-term regular porn use has affected his desire for intimacy and lovemaking, since he wants sex only when he has already got a hard on. It makes me feel like I don’t turn him on.
This is not necessarily about you – or your husband’s desire, or lack of it, for you – and his pornography use may not be related to his needs regarding the timing of sex with you. Many men are so afraid of not being able to achieve an erection that they approach their partners for sex only when they are already aroused – and for him that may be mornings only.

                    <span>In his new book, Dave Zirin explores the ripple effect of the NFL quarterback’s protests, and how he inspired activists at all levels of American sports
Colin Kaepernick no longer waits for the call to rejoin the NFL. Five years have passed since Kaepernick first sat, then took a knee, during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America. Four years have passed since Kaepernick was ousted from the NFL for his peaceful demonstration. He has never been invited back, despite remaining in top playing shape and possessing the talent to be on a roster.
Kaepernick’s work in the aftermath of his protest transcended football, and he is still as busy as ever. He has written books: one on on criminal justice, and another for children. And he has partnered with acclaimed filmmaker Ava DuVernay to create a Netflix docuseries that debuts on 29 October with a focus on his teenage years and the upbringing that framed his social conscience. While Kaepernick is no longer part of the daily news cycle, his legacy has evolved, a legacy captured in the new book, The Kaepernick Effect: Taking a Knee, Changing the World by Dave Zirin, one of America’s preeminent voices on the intersection of sports and politics.

Modern Toss on the art of the slow burn

If one thing guarantees a TV hit in 2021, it’s a lukewarm reception. Take Ted Lasso, a sitcom about a perky, naive American football coach transplanted on to British soil. Its first season premiered last summer to barely any fanfare – but little by little came mass critical reconsideration. The show ended up a smash hit, breaking the record for most Emmy nominations for a first season of a comedy. Its second series, concluding next month, has made it one of the most talked-about shows of the year.

At a gas station in Mesa, Arizona, more than 2,300 miles from where the twin towers fell on 9/11, stands a permanent reminder of long reaching trauma.
A memorial constructed with speckled white marble and black tile marks the spot where Balbir Singh Sodhi was shot and killed, becoming the first American victim of a fatal hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11.

Amid the glamour, some guests highlighted social issues. The Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had &#x27;tax the rich&#x27; written in red across the back of her white gown and the sports star Megan Rapinoe carried a clutch bag with the words ‘in gay we trust’

When Ruben Santiago-Hudson walks on stage at the Manhattan Theatre Club on Tuesday night, the electric charge between actor and audience will spark back to life. Then the healing will begin.
“It is the balm that we all need right now, not just on stage, but in our city,” says Santiago-Hudson, writer, performer and director of Lackawanna Blues, one of a record seven works by Black playwrights opening on Broadway this autumn. “It’s a necessity, it’s in us as human beings. Theatre has always been the great gathering place – church and theatre.”

The fragile Cerrado grasslands and the Pantanal wetlands, both under threat from soy and beef exploitation, have been excluded from a European Union draft anti-deforestation law, campaigners have said, and there are many other concerning loopholes. 
The European Commission has pledged to introduce a law aimed at preventing beef, palm oil and other products linked to deforestation from being sold in the EU single market of 450 million consumers. But campaigners said a leaked impact assessment reveals “significant omissions” in the plans, including the exclusion of endangered grasslands and wetlands, as well as products that raise environmental concerns, such as rubber and maize.

For months I’ve been watching the construction of our new garage. The breeze-block walls have been built, soffits are in place under the eaves, the concrete floor has been poured and slate tiles are being fixed on to the roof. Soon it will be time to render the exterior with sand and cement, to seal and waterproof the walls, to varnish the new fencing, and finish it all off with a shiny coat of paint.
That means a trip to the DIY store, where the shelves are full of marketing appeals. Glossy varnishes promise to colour wood for five years. Fence treatments are UV resistant and rainproof within half an hour and protect against rot. Masonry paint is no longer just about the colour: do I need pure brilliant or ultra-smooth, anti-mould or weatherproof?

Holding sticks and brooms, the women marched to the liquor shop in the centre of Konar village. It was a rare ambush in the staunchly patriarchal Bihar state in eastern India. But they were at breaking point.
“In every village women were troubled by alcohol. Men harassed them on the streets. Husbands beat them at home,” says Sunita Devi, 52, a former seamstress who led the crowd. “When they saw us they gained courage that we can come together and fight.”

The first thing he noticed was that Birks, who was also from Leek and a performer with the dance group Cappella, looked terrible. He was gasping for breath and his face was pale. “Marcus would never usually have gone on TV without having done his hair and had a shave,” Wynter says.

Four in 10 young people around the world are hesitant to have children as a result of the climate crisis, and fear that governments are doing too little to prevent climate catastrophe, a poll in 10 countries has found.
Nearly six in 10 young people, aged 16 to 25, were very or extremely worried about climate change, according to the biggest scientific study yet on climate anxiety and young people, published on Tuesday. A similar number said governments were not protecting them, the planet, or future generations, and felt betrayed by the older generation and governments.

                    <span>Around the turn of the millennium, hedge fund investors put an audacious bet on coal mining in the US. The bet failed – but it was the workers and the environment that paid the price
Once or twice a generation, Americans rediscover Appalachia. Sometimes, they come to it through caricature – the cartoon strip Li’l Abner or the child beauty pageant star Honey Boo Boo or, more recently, Buckwild, a reality show about West Virginia teenagers, which MTV broadcast with subtitles. Occasionally, the encounter is more compassionate. In 1962, the social critic Michael Harrington published The Other America, which called attention to what he described as a “vicious circle of poverty” that “twists and deforms the spirit”.
Around the turn of this century, hedge funds in New York and its environs took a growing interest in coalmines. Coal never had huge appeal to Wall Street investors – mines were dirty, old-fashioned and bound up by union contracts that made them difficult to buy and sell. But in the late 1990s, the growing economies of Asia began to consume more and more energy, which investors predicted would drive up demand halfway around the world, in Appalachia. In 1997, the Hobet mine, a 25-year-old operation in rural West Virginia, was acquired for the first time by a public company, Arch Coal. It embarked on a major expansion, dynamiting mountaintops and dumping the debris into rivers and streams. As the Hobet mine grew, it consumed the ridges and communities around it. Seen from the air, the mine came to resemble a giant grey amoeba – 22 miles from end to end – eating its way across the mountains.

                    <span>As gaps continue to appear on supermarkets shelves and restaurants take unavailable items off menus, Britain’s supply chains appear to be at the centre of a perfect storm of pandemic disruption coupled with post-Brexit labour shortages
McDonald’s ran out of milkshakes, Nando’s had to close some of its restaurants due to a lack of chicken and Halfords has warned it is short of bikes. Meanwhile, at a key time for harvests, crops are rotting in the fields. It all points to a crisis in Britain’s supply chains that analysts say is the most severe since the 1970s.
The Guardian business reporter Joanna Partridge tells Rachel Humphreys that the problem is a perfect storm of pandemic disruption, component shortages from China and labour shortages exacerbated by Brexit.

My sisters and I are the first generation in almost 50 generations of our family who didn’t grow up speaking te reo Māori as a first language. At first, that fact seems startling – a dramatic rupture from our past and the language that gives form to it. We are only three generations removed from ancestors who were Māori-speaking monoglots, ordering their lives and their world in a language almost foreign to their 21st-century descendants.
But this break between the language our ancestors spoke and the language we speak – English – is the typical Māori experience: only one in five Māori can hold a conversation in their ancestral language, and in the past three national surveys this number has fallen. That makes us anglophones a firm majority in our Indigenous populace.

At a Guardian Live online event on Monday, Clinton fended off suggestions that the world was now witnessing the twilight of US democracy, but said: “I do believe we are in a struggle for the future of our country”.

Under proposals put forward by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), a proportion of places in oversubscribed schools in England could be ringfenced for disadvantaged pupils who live outside the catchment area.

The Hollywood star Amy Adams is to make her West End theatre debut in a revival of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams. Adams, a six-time Oscar nominee, has been cast as the St Louis matriarch Amanda Wingfield in Williams’s “memory play” which is one of his most autobiographical works.
The Glass Menagerie will open at the Duke of York’s theatre in London next spring, directed by Jeremy Herrin who called the 1944 drama “one of the best plays ever written – and probably one of the hardest plays to do because it is so fragile and poetic”. Herrin hailed Adams as “a class act” and a versatile performer with the nuanced approach to bring out the interior life of Amanda, who Williams described as a woman “of great but confused vitality clinging frantically to another time and place”.

This is a splashy theatre-film mashup, with gravity-defying effects, cute quirks and offbeat gags
How does a car speed at 88mph on stage? That must have been the biggest challenge for this musical adaptation of the hit 1985 film about Marty, Doc and the time-travelling DeLorean, which has to achieve that ferocious velocity to tear back across the decades to 1955. Kudos to the production for pulling off the effect so spectacularly.
It really does seem as if the DeLorean is defying the laws of theatre, if not the time-space continuum. The effect is created through a plethora of screens, graphic projections (video design by Finn Ross) and a firework of illuminations (lighting design by Tim Lutkin) that sear beyond the proscenium arch and into the auditorium with the most dazzling illusion of depth at the back of the theatre as well. It sparks a shower of light and colour that, in its magnitude, looks little short of the turning on of the West End’s Christmas lights.

Tim Henman and Virginia Wade add to praise for champion

Andy Murray has hailed Emma Raducanu’s “incredible” US Open win and spoken of a “huge opportunity” for British tennis.
Raducanu took New York by storm, not dropping a set on route to victory as she became the first qualifier in history to claim a grand slam crown. Fellow Briton Murray was asked about the 18-year-old at a press conference on Monday after his Rennes Open first-round victory over Yannick Maden.

At a pre-trial hearing in the US district court for the southern district of New York, Andrew B Brettler, representing the Duke of York, also alleged that Andrew may be protected from the lawsuit by a “secret settlement agreement” which has previously been sealed by a court.

                    <span>These interviews with the so-called ‘baby groupies’ of the 70s and 80s reveal why the music industry desperately needs its own #MeToo moment
Look Away (Sky Documentaries) is a documentary that looks directly at the music industry’s attitudes to and abuse of the young girls who were – and we can assume still are – pushed or pulled into musicians’ orbits. The film’s title comes from a track of the same name on Iggy Pop’s 1996 album Naughty Little Doggie, which is a “tribute” to one of the most famous “baby groupies” on Sunset Strip in the 70s, Sable Starr. “I slept with Sable when she was 13 / Her parents were too rich to do anything / She rocked her way around LA / ’Til a New York Doll carried her away.” Words are not deeds, of course, though Starr did run away from home to live with a member of the Dolls in NYC at 16, and knew Iggy Pop at that time.
“So many little girl songs,” notes Kari Krome, songwriter and co-founder of the Runaways. She was a witness to and frequent victim of the exploitation by older men of young girls who came to Hollywood; she recounts a rape and an assault, and you sense that this is merely the tip of her personal iceberg of trauma. Look Away is built round extensive interviews with her, the Runaways’ bass guitarist, Jackie Fuchs, and Julia Holcomb. Holcomb met Aerosmith’s frontman, Steven Tyler, when she was 16, became his lover, ward (he got her mother to sign over custody so he could cross state lines with her on tour without being arrested), and fiancee in that order. He got her pregnant then pressured her into an abortion, she says, then sent her home.

Boris Johnson is to confirm the start of a booster jabs programme for the over-50s on Tuesday after government scientists finally approved vaccinations for older schoolchildren.
Setting out a widespread acceleration of the vaccine programme before what ministers concede will be a difficult second winter coping with the virus, the prime minister will also signal his opposition to any further lockdowns this year.

In his speech at the TUC conference, the Labour leader will contrast Labour’s offer with the Conservatives’ plan to increase national insurance, saying that under the current government “working families across the country don’t get a pay rise but will get a tax rise”.

US Capitol police arrested a man who had multiple knives, including a bayonet and a machete, in his truck near the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC on Monday.
Patrol officers noticed a Dodge Dakota pickup truck that bore a swastika and had other white supremacist symbols painted on it around midnight on Sunday. According to pictures released by the police, the truck did not have a license plate but instead a picture of an American flag. The truck also had antlers attached to its front grill.

The reality did not disappoint. Everton transformed a war of attrition with Burnley into a highly accomplished victory that maintained Benítez’s unbeaten start and left Goodison purring under the lights.
Andros Townsend illuminated matters on the pitch with a truly stunning strike as Everton made it two comeback victories in two home games under their new manager. Prior to Benítez’s arrival, Everton had won only two of 59 Premier League matches when conceding first.

“The Conservative government’s work is finished for this time around,” Solberg told supporters on Monday. “I want to congratulate Jonas Gahr Støre, who now seems to have a clear majority for a change of government.”

Facebook gives high-profile users special treatment, which includes immunity from its rules for some, and allowed Brazilian footballer Neymar to post nude pictures of a woman who had accused him of rape, according to a report.
The XCheck or “CrossCheck” system steers reviews of posts by well-known users such as celebrities, politicians and journalists into a separate system, according to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal. Under the programme, some users are “whitelisted” – not subject to enforcement action – while others are allowed to post material that violates Facebook rules, pending content reviews that often do not take place.

Price spikes in the global energy market are meant to happen during the cold months of a northern hemisphere winter, which is why their arrival now is alarming. It suggests the current mini-crisis – which, embarrassingly, is seeing the UK shovel millions in the direction of coal plant producers just ahead of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow – has the potential to become much worse come January or February.
As ever in the energy market, it takes a combination of factors to produce a price surge of the degree seen on Monday in the UK – record levels for short-term electricity prices. Wind speeds have been low across northern Europe for most of the year. The UK’s gas stocks are low. And a few plants have gone offline for repairs at a bad moment.

A rooftop swimming pool provided the scene and, as the drinks flowed, people were thrown in. It went on until 8am, although some players and the manager, Roberto Di Matteo, did not make it that far, passing out in their suits on the terrace.

Afghans evacuated to the UK feel like prisoners after being left trapped in quarantine conditions longer than necessary, several of them have told the Guardian, prompting concern about their human rights and wellbeing.
Thousands of officials and military personnel who helped Nato forces were flown out of Kabul after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan at the end of August. They have had to isolate for 10 days in a hotel on arrival because Afghanistan is on the travel “red list”.

                    <span>A pandemic-made project, starring the Oscar winner as a mother racing to save her son, starts out with tension but ends up in silliness
As more pandemic-produced movies continue trickling out, we’re able to see that for the majority, they can be easily placed in two separate, if ultimately similar, columns: those that use the empty outside expanse to maintain distance from others and those that use a small interior setting to keep things simple. This year’s Toronto film festival boasts a number of films scrambled together in the last 18 months but there are two that revolve around the same gimmick: an A-list star dealing with a tense situation through a string of phone calls. In The Guilty, Jake Gyllenhaal tries to save a kidnapped woman while stuck inside a 911 dispatch centre; in Lakewood, Naomi Watts tries to get to the bottom of a school shooting while stranded in the middle of the remote Canadian wilderness. They’re both made by sturdy genre film-makers (The Guilty is from Antoine Fuqua of Training Day and The Equaliser and Lakewood from Philip Noyce of Salt and Patriot Games) and both involve a lot of frenzied emoting.

Owners of the UK’s last remaining coal power stations are in line to be paid record sums to keep the lights on as energy prices reach fresh highs, and could be pushed even higher by lower wind power.
Coal plants have been called on to supply power steadily in recent months, through one of the least windy summers on record since 1961 and sharply rising prices in the wholesale energy market.

Among those invited is Saudi Arabia, to which the UK has allowed the export of £20bn of arms that could be used in the war in Yemen, a bloody seven-year conflict that the UN says has caused the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis.

However, the basic idea of reintroducing large mammals to a vulnerable ecosystem in order to restore and rebalance habitats depleted by our own destructive habits is now widely accepted.

Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, told the House of Lords on Monday night that the EU should take the UK’s proposals to renegotiate part of the protocol “seriously” if it wanted to avoid the protocol collapsing.

Four days later City conceded in the cruellest of ways with four minutes remaining of their Women’s Super League game against Tottenham to lose 2-1.

Clubs in the Premiership, the Championship and the women’s Premier 15s will all be permitted to relax Covid-19 protocols, end social distancing and the wearing of masks will no longer be compulsory in most settings should they reach the 85% target across the playing squad and staff group, as laid out by the Professional Game Board (PGB).

                    <span>It may be too difficult for the Scottish government to enact big bang reforms while pursuing an independence vote
Since 2007, the Scottish National party has been the largest party in Holyrood, dominating politics to become a credible party of government. It has now begun its fourth term in power. Yet the SNP has had few major policy achievements and nothing comparable to the flagship policies around tuition fees or care for the elderly associated with the previous Labour administration. The SNP has made some big promises. Nicola Sturgeon, the party’s leader, says that she wants to set up a National Care Service in Scotland by 2026 as a “fitting legacy from the trauma of Covid”.
Yet it is questionable whether such a project, the cost of which experts say the SNP has underestimated, could be enacted in tandem with pursuing an independence referendum when support for leaving the UK is ebbing. The constitutional question energises the SNP activist base. It is why Ms Sturgeon told delegates at her party conference that she wanted a second referendum on Scotland’s independence by 2023. Downing Street’s rejection of another poll points to a gruelling stalemate in the years ahead.

In Franz Kafka’s The Trial, a blameless citizen wakes up one day to find himself under suspicion for no good reason. It was, presumably, never the intention of the architects of Brexit to inflict a similar kind of psychological pressure on British citizens living abroad with non-UK spouses. But bureaucratic indifference and a signal lack of compassion are turning hitherto ordinary lives upside down in Kafkaesque fashion.
At the weekend, it was reported that a British woman needing to return to the UK with her French partner had been forced to come without him, much to the distress of their six-year-old son, who wants to know when he will see his father again. Before Brexit, of course, a family move such as this would have been straightforward. But in yet another example of performative cruelty when it comes to Britain’s borders, the Home Office has introduced a complex family permit to cover such cases. Thus, through no fault of their own, returning Britons who fell in love and settled down abroad are struggling to prove the genuine nature of their claim to have jointly resided with their partner in the EU.

Altior ran up an unbeaten sequence of 19 races over both hurdles and fences between October 2015 and April 2019 which included four victories at the Cheltenham Festival: the Supreme Novice Hurdle (2016), the Arkle Trophy (2017) and then wins in the Queen Mother Champion Chase in the following two seasons.

Sharing the Load is a column about parenting children of all ages

How can I stop my son’s meltdowns at the swimming pool?
The dawning realisation of my limitations as a parent came in the aftermath of a(nother) pre-swimming meltdown. My son was approaching four at the time but still swam like a baby. That might sound harsh but I mean it literally – he was still in the “parent and bub” class splashing alongside six-month-olds. What’s more, his stubborn resistance to the class was growing by the week.

Australia has its “head in the sand” regarding the national security implications of climate change and should follow the US in spelling out the risks, a former senior Australian defence official says.
Australia’s “strategic weakness” on climate policy is also making it harder for the country to be seen as a preferred partner with Pacific Island countries, according to Cheryl Durrant, the defence department’s former head of preparedness.

Defence and intelligence chiefs warned the Australian government multiple times in April the situation in Afghanistan could become dangerous enough to force the closure of the embassy, it has been revealed.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had been in talks with the Department of Defence since January 2021 about the “deteriorating security situation”, but the warnings about the diplomatic mission in Kabul were made shortly after the US announced plans to withdraw from Afghanistan.

                    <span>Praise for the tennis star from Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage reveal an extraordinary hypocrisy
At the weekend, 18-year-old Emma Raducanu became the first qualifier, and first British woman in 44 years, to win a grand slam singles tennis title. Raducanu, from Bromley, beat the 19-year-old Canadian, Leylah Fernandez, in the first grand slam final between two teenagers in 22 years. It was a momentous occasion that has made Raducanu into Britain’s brightest new sports star almost overnight. And while we should share in the collective joy of her remarkable triumph, it is also worth reflecting on the meaning of Raducanu’s heritage.
A Mandarin speaker, she was born in Canada to a Romanian father and Chinese mother, arriving in the UK at the age of two. In other words, Raducanu’s migration story is Britain’s migration story: varied, global and drawing from multiple cultural legacies. Yet how much do we in the UK really value the lives of immigrant families such as the Raducanus, when, instead of achieving greatness on the world stage, they’re living ordinary lives, often in the roles of the low-paid essential workers who keep the country running?

The prince wrote a letter thanking businessman and banker Dmitry Leus, 51, for his offer to the Prince’s Foundation last year, and proposing a meeting after the Covid crisis, the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Times have reported.

Amid tight security and demonstrations by protesters, a vast array of weaponry will be on sale at the UK’s most controversial trade fair, DSEI, which opens on Tuesday. However, it is the purchase of UK companies that is likely to occupy the thoughts of bosses – and the government – in one corner of the fair.

Such is the 18-year-old’s burgeoning popularity in the United States that she was invited on to two of America’s flagship programmes – ABC’s Good Morning America and the NBC Today Show, each with more than 3 million viewers – to talk about winning her first tennis grand slam tournament.

Care home leaders are urging the government to lift restrictions on low-paid foreign workers entering the UK to help solve a staffing crisis, which could be exacerbated by more than 70,000 staff being forced out in November if they do not get fully vaccinated.
Care England, which represents the largest private care home chains, said ministers should cut the qualifying salary level for overseas recruitment of social care staff from £25,600 and add all care workers to the shortage occupation list used to grant visas. Currently the list includes only care managers and senior care staff rather than rank and file, even though some operators are facing such extensive shortages that they are having to turn down care requests.

A young crowd – who could make even twentysomethings feel fossilised – gleefully accepted their city’s rave mantle, losing it to Megan Thee Stallion, Bicep and more
Hosting 80,000 rain-resistant punters each day, Parklife festival encapsulates the energy of Manchester as an enclave of rave. This year’s edition boasts one of the UK’s most ambitious lineups, mixing blockbuster international acts such as Burna Boy and Megan Thee Stallion with domestic talent in the form of Dave, the soulful sounds of Celeste, on-the-rise acts such as Shygirl and pop favourites Mabel. The lifeblood of the festival, though, is arguably dance music, with the BPM of stages including The Valley – which has excellent production values, modelled like a block of flats with a fake ad billboard for dystopian food gels declaring “food is boring” – or The Temple soaring throughout each of the two days for a baby-faced, happy crowd.
The prospect of being sandwiched between hordes of drug-enhanced teenagers could have been enough to trigger an existential crisis, but while even 27-year-olds could feel like fossils here, the bracing euphoria of Manchester’s premier music event returning after a year away is palpable. The nation watched as Andy Burnham passionately battled for more money as the city bore the brunt of the Covid-19 tier system; disgruntled Mancunians spent more of the last 18 months living under restrictions than London, prompting graffiti around the city declaring: “The North is not a petri dish.”

Len McCluskey was general secretary of Unite from 2011-21

At the Labour party conference this month, Keir Starmer has an opportunity to turn things around. So far, his leadership has been a tale of opportunities wasted. He squandered the goodwill that greeted his arrival as Labour leader, opting for internal war rather than unity. Unwilling to look outwards and give a clear message to the country, his poll ratings crumbled.
Starmer’s response to his party’s poor position has been as wrongheaded as it is dishonourable: he has signalled that he may ditch the 10 radical policy pledges he made to Labour and trade union members, on which he was elected to his job. If he is not careful, he risks becoming fixed in the public’s mind as someone who can’t be trusted.

Len McCluskey has revealed for the first time his detailed recollection of negotiations with Keir Starmer to readmit Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour party, and accused the leader of reneging on private promises.
The former Unite general secretary, who stepped down last month, said Starmer “risks becoming fixed in the public’s mind as someone who can’t be trusted”. Writing in the Guardian, he gives an account of the private conversations – a section redacted in review copies of his memoir, Always Red, because of its sensitivity.

                    <span>Readers believe the party should look to the pledges it made on tax and spending
Here’s an idea for Labour policy on social care – the one presented in the 2019 general election manifesto (Labour may tax wealth more heavily to fund social care, says Starmer, 9 September). This was a costed proposal for an extra £10.8bn in spending to establish a National Care Service, including free personal care for the over-65s, an end to 15-minute-maximum home visits, and an increase in the carer’s allowance.
The grey book accompanying the manifesto calculated that taxing capital gains and dividends at income tax rates would yield £14bn. While Labour should have committed to ending the social care market to achieve its goal of “ensuring care is delivered for people not for profit”, it still would have been a step forward compared with alternatives being proposed today. The fact that this was Jeremy Corbyn’s policy meant that Boris Johnson’s non-plan for social care was met with a vacuum, not an opposition.

                    <span>The lack of help for troubled young people fills me with despair. Not much has changed since the 1980s, says Steven Walker
Another story about the lack of help for troubled children (Sharp rise in acute medical beds occupied by children with nowhere else to go, 13 September) fills me with a sense of deja vu and despair. After 35 years in child protection and child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) as a social worker and then psychotherapist, I’ve seen the same story time and time again. A few weeks ago it was the crisis in local government children’s services, and in April the Royal College of Psychiatrists reported the risks children faced, with record waiting times for Camhs help.
But this was happening back in the 1980s when we were struggling with overwhelming demand for family support services to prevent child abuse and the deterioration of children’s mental health. Tory libertarian ideologues have succeeded in hollowing out state services, and presided over unnecessary austerity cuts that have proved a false economy. The result is that a generation of neglected children and disadvantaged families have developed much more serious, damaging and expensive chronic problems. Until the needs of our future citizens are acknowledged and supported, the inevitable consequences in antisocial behaviour, self-harm, suicides, declining school attainment and family trauma will continue.

                    <span>Éric Zemmour is about to begin a book tour, but has not yet announced his candidacy for president
The French far-right journalist and commentator Éric Zemmour has stepped down from his nightly TV show, heightening speculation that he could make an outsider bid to run in next year’s French presidential election.
The 63-year-old, who was a political journalist for Le Figaro, holds convictions for inciting hatred and is best known for his TV diatribes against immigration and Islam.

The NHS may be unable to cope this winter because of a “frightening” shortfall of more than 50,000 doctors, the head of the British Medical Association has warned.
The number of medics in England has fallen further behind comparable European countries over the summer, ahead of what is predicted to be one of the worst winters in the 73-year history of the health service, Dr Chaand Nagpaul said.

                    <span>Film-makers scrambling together projects during difficult conditions have decided mostly to base their work on couples with money above all else
When all is said and done, the quarantine movie might be Hollywood’s briefest genre. It was born only out of circumstance. When the world went into lockdown last spring and Hollywood effectively paused all productions, several film-makers discovered they didn’t have an off switch, so they conjured up projects that could be filmed during lockdown, each with a limited crew, small cast, and single location. These films, including Malcolm &amp; Marie, Locked Down, Together and Language Lessons, will forever be considered not as individual works but as a collective. That is, if they are considered at all. Even though not all of these films are explicitly about Covid-19, it’s impossible to think of them outside of the context in which they were made. When this pandemic is over for good, it’s quite possible that no one will ever want to be reminded of it.

A herd of cows has been “potty-trained” in an experiment that scientists say could pave the way for more environmentally friendly farms.
Waste from cattle farms often contaminates soil and waterways and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and the acidification of soil. For this reason, toilet-training cattle has long been viewed as desirable, but several previous attempts have been unsuccessful.

                    <span>Managing the pandemic is a balance of personal liberty and public safety, and the government needs to tread a fine line
Eighteen months is a long time in Covid politics. Boris Johnson’s much-flagged series of announcements this week for the UK will mark his route “back to normal” and to “learning to live with the disease”. Like most people, he has matured over the past year, a journey from carelessness to panic to pragmatism. The journey was never about “following the science”. It was following the politics by cherrypicking the science, as with the initial decision over herd immunity. First the cry was herd immunity, then it was test and trace, now it is vaccination. And it is vaccination that has given Johnson his window back to normality. He owes a mighty debt to pharmacological science.
The cabinet, still drenched in the new Tory authoritarianism, is reportedly not ready to dismantle the grim edifice of the 2020 emergency Coronavirus Act, licensing the government to control crowds, detain and surveil the public, in order to stop the pandemic. The act needs renewing every six months and is now coming due. Johnson has acknowledged the public’s exhaustion with the controls that have dictated life in Britain for the past year and a half. They have forced him to ban families from their loved ones’ deathbeds, empty our mountains and beaches, and cripple a million livelihoods, all for the sake of bureaucratic one-size-fits-all. But Tory backbenchers see the 2020 act as embodying “the most draconian detention powers in modern British legal history”. They want its blood.

                    <span>Production of meat worldwide emits 28 times as much as growing plants, and most crops are raised to feed animals bound for slaughter
The global production of food is responsible for a third of all planet-heating gases emitted by human activity, with the use of animals for meat causing twice the pollution of producing plant-based foods, a major new study has found.
The entire system of food production, such as the use of farming machinery, spraying of fertilizer and transportation of products, causes 17.3bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, according to the research. This enormous release of gases that fuel the climate crisis is more than double the entire emissions of the US and represents 35% of all global emissions, researchers said.

Speaking in a new documentary, Alanis Morissette has said she was the victim of multiple statutory rapes as a teenager.
The documentary, Jagged, is screening at the Toronto film festival this week. The Washington Post has reported that Morissette describes the attacks during the film. “It took me years in therapy to even admit there had been any kind of victimisation on my part,” she says. “I would always say I was consenting, and then I’d be reminded like ‘Hey, you were 15, you’re not consenting at 15.’ Now I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, they’re all paedophiles. It’s all statutory rape.’”

Childcare for working parents is one huge wobbling Jenga stack, in which someone is always yanking out the brick that brings everything crashing down. Child running a temperature? Crash. Stuck late at work? Crash. But increasingly, what’s collapsing it is the cost.

The 2022 league table

Transition points in life, such as going to university, can be exciting, but they can also bring up feelings of stress, anxiety and nervousness. Making a big life change during a pandemic is even more of a challenge.
There’s nothing to be ashamed of if you’re feeling a bit uneasy about the prospect. It happens to even the most confident and accomplished of us. Alex George, youth mental health ambassador to the government and author of Live Well Every Day, recalls feeling unsettled for a month when he started a new job in London. “It was my dream job, I was so excited about it, but I was so nervous,” he says.

Searching for Covid-19 on the site gives the top result as Joseph Mercola and Ronnie Cummins’s The Truth About Covid-19, a title that claims to reveal how the “effectiveness of the vaccines has been wildly exaggerated”, how the virus was lab-engineered in Wuhan, and how “safe, simple, and inexpensive treatment and prevention for Covid-19 have been censored and suppressed to create a clear path for vaccine acceptance”.

Coronavirus – latest updates

While the government has shelved plans for Covid passports in nightclubs and other crowded places in England, at least a dozen EU countries now operate similar schemes for access to a wide range of venues and activities, from restaurants to team sports.

                    <span>A new study reveals the terrifying truth that too much television lowers your volume of grey matter. But TV is the defining art form of our age – so I refuse to quit
Until now, claims that television makes you stupid have only been backed up by anecdotal evidence. True, at a certain point it does seem that people who watch vast amounts of TV do become so intellectually impaired that they start involuntarily clapping along to theme tunes like imprisoned sea lions performing for fish, but that isn’t anything you could write a medical paper about.
Now, sadly, science has trundled along to back it up. According to Dr Ryan Dougherty, from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, the more television you watch in middle age, the lower your volume in grey matter. Examining the viewing habits of 599 American adults between 1990 and 2011, Dougherty found that those who watched an above average amount of television showed reduced volume in their frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Basically, your mum was right: TV really does rot your brain.

Spire Healthcare, one of Britain’s leading private hospital operators has returned to profit after a surge in patients choosing to pay for hip and knee operations.

His three pre-release stadium listening parties ensured that Donda, his third sub-par album on the trot, debuted with an undeserved bang. But even his manicfrenzied self-promotion doesn’t earn him a seat at the top table in the history of hype.

At the top of a Florida-based telehealth website that promises “quality meds with fast shipping”, above a menu of skin care products, erectile dysfunction medications and hair loss treatments, sits a bright orange banner with bold lettering: “LOOKING FOR IVERMECTIN? CLICK HERE,” it reads.
The telehealth site is one of numerous online providers that have moved to capitalize on the surge in demand for ivermectin as Covid-19 cases rise across the US. The drug, an anti-parasitic used in both humans and livestock, has become the latest in a series of much-hyped medications for which doctors say there is no conclusive evidence they work to treat coronavirus.

Allow me to present the snacking buffet. Shelly Westerhausen Worcel is the author – along with Wyatt Worcel – of the book Tables &amp; Spreads, which explains how to create an array of beautiful and elaborate grazing treats. Here are her top tips.

                    <span>The author on his exhilarating research into the human mind, teaching creative writing at Broadmoor – and his new, follow-up novel
I was about 50 when I wrote Human Traces or “The Footsteps on Mount Low”, as it was originally called. It came out in 2005. In the bright glow of hindsight it seems to be the book of someone who, at the middle point of life, is pausing to take stock and to confront what he believes to be his Waterloo. You can hear the intake of breath and flexing of muscles in the opening pages. If not now, when?
The question the novel attempted to answer was simply: what are we? What kind of creature? So ingenious, yet so unstable. Masters of the planet, yet separated from all its other inhabitants by our possession of the gift – or curse – of consciousness. Eternal refugees from a lost Eden, of whom one in a hundred suffers from severe delusions.

                    <span>Women have long been taught to be ashamed of their vulvas, with increasing numbers turning to cosmetic surgery in pursuit of genital ‘perfection’. But a new generation is fighting back
When Florence Schechter opened the Vagina Museum – the world’s first museum dedicated to gynaecological anatomy – in London in 2019, it was partly a response to a dramatic rise in labiaplasty surgery. Instances of such surgery more than doubled in the first decade of this century, then carried on climbing. Zoe Williams, the spokesperson for the museum (who shares my name), says part of the problem is that most women have not seen other vulvas. “Quite a lot of people have never even seen their own, so it’s hard to have a concept of what’s normal. Certainly, throughout art history, the pictures of nude women very seldom had any protruding labia; you just had a neat little cleft.”
Labiaplasty is surgery to alter the appearance of the vulva – generally by trying to reduce the size of the labia minora, the inner genital lips, so that they don’t hang below the labia majora, the outer ones. The reasons for such surgery are not solely cosmetic – they could be related to childbirth, or chafing during sport – yet the rise is staggering. The number of labiaplasty surgeries in 2016 was up 45% on 2015 – the biggest growth of any cosmetic surgery procedure, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.

                    <span>Cathy, 56 and Maurizio, 58, became close after she hired him as a massage therapist in 2014. They now live together at their home in Welling, Kent
After splitting up from her partner at the age of 35, Cathy didn’t feel as if she would find love again. “I developed lymphedema around the same time, which made my leg balloon,” she says. “My relationship had failed and I could hardly move because of my condition. I didn’t feel like anyone would find me attractive. It felt like my life was over.” Over the next few years she focused on her health and wellbeing. “I became interested in different types of therapies and took a training course in lymph drainage massage,” she says. Although she dabbled in dating, she never met anyone suitable.
In April 2014, a friend introduced her to an Italian massage therapist called Maurizio. After training in Auroville, an experimental community in Tamil Nadu, south India, he had come to London to start his practice. “I’d fallen in love with England in the 70s when I first visited,” he says. “I came here to promote my work because I enjoyed the lifestyle so much.”

                    <span>It should be alarming to be up this high, but it’s weirdly calming. Is it possible I’m forming an emotional bond with Bumble?
I loved my driving theory test. It involved a video game of old people and dogs, the idea being I had to try not to kill them, like a reverse Grand Theft Auto. I assumed that driving a horse would involve a similar amount of sit-down theory, perhaps an instructional DVD. Yet, within minutes of my arrival at Silvermere Equestrian Centre in Surrey, instructor Charly Press has told me to throw my leg over and sit on top of Bumble, a real horse. I’m not qualified for this, and, incidentally, never passed my actual driving test. I’m too good at Grand Theft Auto.
“Don’t you have any trousers?” Press asks. It’s a hot day, and I don’t. “I guess we’re doing this cowboy-style.” She doesn’t mean I have the swagger of a vaquero – in my shorts, helmet and polo top, I look like I’ve been airlifted off a mountain at the taxpayers’ expense. I climb some little circus steps, and get on to a horse for the first time in my life. It feels so wrong. I grew up in south London where only the police or imagined aristocrats rode horses. But times are changing, and the number of people who tried horse riding in 2019 rose to 3 million. (That statistic is from the British Equestrian Trade Association, though obviously one wishes it had been Gallup.) There’s also a less “proper journalism” reason for my visit. I’ve heard that horses are excellent therapists, and my usual therapist is away for the month.

A chandelier sparkling in the background, the grandeur of Downing Street gleaming behind him, Boris Johnson looks into the camera and speaks with solemnity. He is marking World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, he says, to raise awareness of these “terrible afflictions … which impose an immense burden of suffering in developing countries”.
Huge progress has been made, he says, in the fight against the diseases, not least as a result of British aid to some of the poorest parts of the world. But there is more – much more – to be done: more than a billion people are still at risk, he warns, and that is why the UK “fully supports” the World Health Organization’s big elimination push over the next decade.

                    <span>Scientists treating depression and a range of other mental illnesses have been running controlled trials using MDMA and psychedelic drugs such as LSD and the results have been encouraging
Aside from the profound immediate health challenges of the global pandemic, many countries in recent years have had huge increases in numbers of people presenting with depression and other mental illnesses. In the UK, prescriptions for antidepressants has more than doubled in the past decade. 
This huge demand has meant opportunities for research into all sorts of possible treatments for mental illnesses and for Robin Carhart-Harris that has meant groundbreaking investigations into the possible therapeutic uses of psychedelics and other controlled substances. The mind-altering properties of drugs such as ecstasy, LSD and magic mushrooms are well known, but their usefulness to medicine has until now not been the subject of rigorous medical trials. The early results are encouraging. Robin tells Rachel Humphreys how he has been leading work showing how psilocybin ( or magic mushrooms) can be used to assist psychotherapy for difficult-to-treat depression, making a significant difference where conventional antidepressants and talking therapy have not.

                    <span>Centre-left frontrunner Olaf Scholz gets another boost after second of three televised debates between would-be Merkel successors
Candidates representing the two parties that have governed Germany in a “grand coalition” for 12 out of the past 16 years tore into each other’s record on Sunday night, in a televised election debate that saw centre-left frontrunner Olaf Scholz declared winner despite swipes from his conservative rival.
In the second of three televised debates, hosted by Germany’s two public broadcasters, conservative candidate Armin Laschet of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) tried to turn his fortunes around by attacking finance minister Scholz of the Social Democratic party (SPD) over his track-record on tackling money laundering and corruption.

North Korea carried out successful tests of a new long-range cruise missile over the weekend, its state media outlet KCNA said, amid a protracted standoff with the United States over denuclearisation.
The missiles are “a strategic weapon of great significance” and flew 1,500 km (930 miles) before hitting their targets and falling into the country’s territorial waters during the tests held on Saturday and Sunday, KCNA said.The missiles travelled for 7,580 seconds along “oval and pattern-8 flight orbits”, it reported.

The spirit of cooperation between the Scottish and UK governments established during the pandemic should result in agreement on a second independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon has said.
In comments released ahead of her speech at the Scottish National party online conference on Monday, the first minister is expected to say that “democracy must – and will – prevail”, regarding the results of May’s parliamentary election in Scotland, which returned a pro-independence majority.

Chronic neglect of the NHS, poor pandemic preparedness and flawed government policies have contributed to the appalling impact of the Covid-19 crisis in the UK, according to a damning assessment from the British Medical Association.
More than 130,000 people in the UK have died from coronavirus since the pandemic began, with non-Covid excess deaths up 12,000 last year, making the country one of the hardest hit among comparable nations, the doctors’ body said.

                    <span>Labour and CBI express concerns the government’s tax policies are bad for business and workers
Higher national insurance payments will leave low-paid frontline workers potentially more than £1,000 a year worse off, while also depriving firms of the cash needed to invest, according to the latest analyses.
The combination of higher national insurance contributions (NICs), Universal Credit cuts and a freeze on the income tax personal allowance, would take £1,040 a year away from the average supermarket worker, according to Labour. The retail sector is the UK’s biggest private sector employer. For hospitality workers, nurses and social care workers the hit is bigger at about £1,100.

Murders of environment and land defenders hit a record high last year as the violent resource grab in the global south continued unabated despite the pandemic.
New figures released by Global Witness show that 227 people were killed in 2020 while trying to protect forests, rivers and other ecosystems that their livelihoods depended on.

Under the scheme, offshore wind developers will compete for contracts worth up to £200m a year, and onshore wind and solar farms will be in line for their first subsidies in more than five years.

Kema Sikazwe – AKA actor and rapper Kema Kay – performs a sunny, charming but vulnerable musical monologue about growing up in the northeast of England
Kema Sikazwe’s first name means “the one who shines” in the language of his Zambian parents. It suits him. The rapper and actor, who also performs as Kema Kay, has a radiance that draws you to him. For all the fast-talking punch of his lyrics, he comes across as a good soul, an innocent trying to make sense of a world that hasn’t always reciprocated his positive intentions.
In this autobiographical solo show, first seen in 2019 and revised for this run, he tells a coming-of-age story about his quest to fit in. It strikes home for its honesty, vulnerability and, in its mix of spoken word and music, its virtuosity – that and the finely tuned production by Graeme Thompson.

                    <span>Russian wins first major tournament after 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory
Rod Laver in 1969 was last man to win all majors in calendar year

As Daniil Medvedev stood in the tunnel of Arthur Ashe Stadium before the US Open final, the last man standing in front of Novak Djokovic’s historic grand slam attempt, he was asked in his pre-match interview exactly what he learned from losing to Djokovic in the Australian Open final in February. He responded calmly and without hesitation: “Well, I learned that I have to be much better.”
Over the following two hours he simply was. For the majority of his third major final Medvedev bullied Djokovic from the baseline, he erected a defensive wall on his half of the court and he served as if he was standing from a tree. In the process Medvedev thwarted Djokovic’s shot at immortality, outplaying the world No 1 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to win his first major title at the US Open.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Robert Jenrick reaffirmed the government’s “full devolution” approach, outlined in the Conservatives’ 2019 manifesto, despite concerns Boris Johnson had soured on the idea after a high-profile spat with Andy Burnham, Labour Greater Manchester mayor, over coronavirus last year.

Creativity on the cheap, a towering South American centre-forward and an experienced Premier League goalkeeper as back-up. David Moyes may recognise Everton’s recent transfer window because it was almost identical to one he oversaw in 2011, when money was tight and the club were reliant on good coaching to close a considerable gap to the leading pack. Ten years and at least half a billion pounds later, Everton are back in familiar territory.

Unbeaten at home in the league last season, City went ahead through a Lauren Hemp header in the sixth minute and, with a relentless series of attacks down Tottenham’s right, it looked to be a matter of time before they added to the tally.

As recently as April 2019 Rose was the world No 1; he now finds himself overlooked by Europe after Harrington turned to Ian Poulter, Sergio García and Shane Lowry.
“I’m really happy with my team,” Harrington said. “I am absolutely thrilled. My biggest difficulty will be that I have too many good players.I have a great team, probably the best team of ball strikers Europe has ever sent out in a Ryder Cup.” High praise, indeed.

                    <span>Stephen Karam’s Tony-winning play makes the leap to film with ease, an extraordinarily well-acted, uncomfortably intimate look at a family at Thanksgiving
There’s a surprising urgency to Stephen Karam’s adaptation of his Tony-winning play The Humans, a vitality one might not expect from a film that sounds like something we’ve seen many times before. Not only is the set-up of a dysfunctional multi-generational family descending on a Manhattan apartment for Thanksgiving as dilapidated as most Manhattan apartments themselves (the post-American Beauty world of indies was forever damaged by the increasingly cliched quirky family subgenre) but the decision to film a one-location, one-act play (especially by the person who originated it on stage) can often be the result of vanity rather than necessity.

Maria Mendiola, one of the members of Baccara, whose 1977 disco hit Yes Sir, I Can Boogie is the unofficial anthem of Scotland football fans, has died.
Mendiola, who was one half of the Spanish duo, was best known for her rendition of the hit song. She died in Madrid surrounded by her family on Saturday morning at the age of 69. Cristina Sevilla, her partner in a later iteration of the group, expressed her gratitude on social media in a message written in Spanish.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Plans to introduce vaccine passports across England next month have been shelved in a dramatic U-turn by the government, but Conservative opponents fear they could still be made mandatory later this year amid a warning the NHS faces “the worst winter in living memory”.
Just weeks after Boris Johnson announced the controversial documents would be necessary for fully vaccinated people to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the policy had been suspended and would not go ahead from 1 October.

Criticism has continued to mount after the prime minister announced a 1.25% tax to be paid by workers and businesses aimed at finally resolving the social care crisis he promised he had a strategy to fix more than two years ago on the steps of Downing Street.

Before Emma Raducanu took her unexpected first small steps into the big time at Wimbledon in July, she was planning her schedule as she finally started her full-time professional career. Her ranking of 366 severely limited the level of tournaments she could directly enter, so her modest plans were to compete in lower-level $25k ITF tournaments and to slowly build her ranking.
And so, as she basked in the glory of an unprecedented grand slam title run in New York that shocked her as much as anyone else, those plans destroyed for good, it made sense she was determined to enjoy every last moment of her success. When she was asked in her press conference to reflect on how her life will change and the superstardom to come, it was the very last thing on her mind.

Pope Francis has urged Hungary to “extend its arms towards everyone” in an apparent veiled critique of Viktor Orbán’s anti-migrant policies, as the pontiff began a four-day visit to central Europe in his first big international outing since undergoing intestinal surgery in July.
Francis, 84, appeared in good form during his visit to Budapest, presiding over a lengthy mass and standing as he waved to crowds from his open-sided popemobile. He used a golf cart to avoid walking long distances indoors and confessed at one point that he had to sit because “I’m not 15 any more”. But otherwise he kept up the typical gruelling pace of a papal trip.

“We still meet the belief … that vaccination is a gigantic fraud deliberately perpetuated for the sake of gain … The opposition to vaccination … like many emotional reactions, is supported by a wealth of argument which the person reacting honestly believes to be the logical foundation of his behaviour.”

How do UK childcare costs stack up against the best?
‘The cost is insane’: the parents unable to afford childcare

Tens of thousands of working parents say the government is failing them with inadequate childcare policies that leave them financially crippled, stymied in their careers and desperate for radical change, according to a major survey.
The survey of more than 20,000 working parents, which was shared with the Guardian and involved more than a dozen organisations, found that 96% believed ministers were not doing enough to support parents with the cost and availability of childcare while 97% said childcare in the UK was too expensive.

                    <span>A wide-ranging crackdown and leftist rhetoric have stirred fears of a return to the apogee of Maoism
Fifty-five years ago, China was in turmoil. Mao had launched the Cultural Revolution to eradicate opposition in the party and cleanse the country’s political soul, using the power of the masses. It would last a decade and claim well over a million lives; 36 million people were hounded, including Xi Jinping’s father, who had previously been a senior leader. The current president was himself denounced and spent years living in bleak rural poverty.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Xi has spoken scathingly of the Cultural Revolution in the past. Yet many now see growing echoes of the era. The Communist elders who survived the disaster sought to cage the power of the leader through consensus and new conventions. Under those, Mr Xi would be expected to step down as general secretary of the party – the role that gives him real power – next autumn, after 10 years. But putative successors have been sidelined or ousted, and dismantling term limits for the presidency, his other position, was a clear sign he plans to continue. The overt hostility to foreign influences is growing. A personality cult is flourishing; new textbooks on Xi Jinping Thought tell young schoolchildren that “Grandpa Xi Jinping has always cared for us … ”

                    <span>An ancient Greek graffito points to an overlooked culture of popular verse 
Think of ancient Greek verse and what often springs to mind are those great beacons of literary achievement, the epics of Homer, the odes of Pindar, the dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, the lyrics of Sappho. But the canon is only a reflection of the limits of our knowledge; vast swathes of ancient literature do not survive, and there are whole realms of cultural activity that never even got as far as a manuscript, leave alone the opportunity to withstand history’s vicissitudes. New research suggests that there was a substrate of more demotic, more everyday verse that has remained largely invisible to modern eyes.
Prof Tim Whitmarsh of the University of Cambridge has examined a short verse that survives not because it was copied down by Byzantine monks, preserved through the medieval age then “rediscovered” in the Renaissance, like much canonical classical literature, but because it was inscribed into semi-precious stones as cameos, and, in one instance, scratched on to a wall as a graffito.

                    <span>Hampstead theatre, London
Set during the strange, out-of-time days between a death in the family and the funeral, Shelagh Stephenson’s 1996 play precariously balances riotous humour and pathos
How should you behave when your mother’s just died? There ought to be a Sudden Death Etiquette guide, suggests one of the sisters preparing for their mum’s funeral in Shelagh Stephenson’s play. That handbook probably wouldn’t advise an immediate shag, guffawing with laughter or getting stoned. Finding oneself in the bedroom of the recently deceased, it is equally indecorous to dress up in her clothes, play with her breast pump or kiss your sister’s husband.
Such transgressions make Stephenson’s play, revived at the theatre where it premiered 25 years ago, sound like a farce. But it precariously balances riotous humour with pathos by exploring the ways we view our parents; how our lasting impression of them can be fixed at such a young age, only gradually shifting over time; and how long it takes children to see their own lives through their parents’ eyes.

                    <span>Teenager’s victory came out of nowhere so it needs perspective – we cannot expect her to keep doing this in majors
So: that happened. As Emma Raducanu emerged from Arthur Ashe Stadium clutching the US Open trophy to her chest, the blood on her knee still visible from where she had fallen, it was possible to feel a little dazed, a little concussed, to feel the edges of the night dissolving a little. In this new unreality an 18-year-old qualifier from Bromley is tennis’s newest star, a figure of adulation and idolisation well beyond the wet island for whom she has just claimed a first grand slam women’s title in 44 years.
You could lose yourself in the records and the milestones: the first qualifier to win a major title in the Open era, the youngest slam winner since Maria Sharapova, the first woman to win a major at only her second attempt. You could seek out historical context. But comparing Raducanu to the 17-year-old Boris Becker winning Wimbledon in 1985 doesn’t quite work, because Becker was a top-20 player at the time.

Shortly after the sun rose over central Paris, the first of the orange-clad rope technicians hopped over the top of the Arc de Triomphe and began to abseil down the landmark unrolling a swathe of silvery blue fabric that shimmered in the early light.
Someone clapped as the first abseiler went over the top – 50 metres from the ground – but most in the crowd of onlookers just held their breath. It was a slow and meticulous operation, requiring them to stop make adjustments to the folds in the material every few metres while avoiding touching the arch itself.

This bizarre sentimental dramedy is fatuous and phoney in every particular: a quite extraordinary festival of gibberish. Every implausible scene, every unconvincing character, every contrived dollop of symbolism, every toe-curlingly misjudged and unearned emotional climax seems as if it has been concocted in some secret bio-warfare lab for assaulting your mind with pure, toxic nonsense.

                    <span>Twenty years on, readers discuss events in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the US
Jonathan Powell makes some good points (The lesson we failed to learn from 9/11: peace is impossible if we don’t talk to our enemies, 10 September). However, when he says: “There was no real alternative to going after the leadership of al-Qaida” and “there was no real alternative to taking on the Taliban themselves”, I beg to differ. 9/11 was a crime, not an act of war. It was not committed by, or in the name of, the Afghan people, who would go on to be slaughtered in so many thousands.
Despite the recalcitrance of the Taliban, it could, and should, have been responded to using the mechanisms of international law. Weak and slow moving though they are, they do exist and can succeed eventually, as witnessed by, for example, successful prosecutions of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.

What will the verdict of history be on a country that turns its back so flagrantly upon human rights in general and the right to seek asylum through any available means in particular (Priti Patel to send boats carrying migrants to UK back across Channel, 9 September)? Priti Patel and Boris Johnson will join Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán et al as the embodiment of all that is most repugnant in the rightwing agenda, rejecting definitively any residual claim to moral leadership these once humane countries might have possessed. I doubt that I am alone in telling European friends of the shame I feel at allowing such people to lead my country. Their contribution to the defeat of the democratic ideal should not be underestimated by history.
David Cragg-James
Stonegrave, North Yorkshire
• I am writing to you to express my disgust at Priti Patel’s plans to implement laws for the UK Border Force to allow “pushbacks” in the Channel. I have witnessed and documented pushbacks by the Hellenic Coast Guard while volunteering for rescue charities in Greece. They are never humane or safe, with a hugely increased risk of weak and scared men, women and children who cannot swim entering the water.

David Pallister, the former Guardian reporter, who has died aged 76 following complications after a lung cancer operation, was involved in many of the paper’s most spectacular investigations. He was a member of the team that exposed the former Conservative politicians Jonathan Aitken and Neil Hamilton, both of whom unsuccessfully sued the paper for libel and he played a major part in the coverage of the wrongful convictions of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six.
It was his provocative article on the Guardian’s front page in 1995 about Aitken’s connections with the Saudis that prompted the latter’s famous press conference in which he promised that the “sword of truth” would root out “the cancer of bent and twisted journalism” supposedly represented by the work of Pallister and his colleague, David Leigh. This led to the libel action against the Guardian and Aitken’s eventual conviction for perjury in 1999.

                    <span>The £20 uplift is all that keeps many families afloat, even those who work. Yet it’s due to end within weeks
As the days get shorter and autumn slowly comes into view, you can feel it: a deep sense of public foreboding, perhaps best summarised as the growing realisation that business as usual is turning out to be nothing of the kind.
People’s anxieties are focused on everything from the closure of the furlough scheme to the fate of an increasingly under-pressure NHS. But for millions, there is no greater source of worry than the end of the so-called £20 weekly “uplift” to universal credit. Scheduled for 6 October, it’s now being confirmed in messages sent via online benefit accounts, and sowing the kind of cold fear that defines far too many British lives. That is the human story: in political terms, the move surely calls time on hopes that Covid-19 might have somehow marked the birth of a less nasty Tory approach to the benefits system.

The bishops, who speak on asylum and refugee issues within the church, said the nationality and borders bill before parliament is an “affront to justice” by putting the saving of life under a legal penalty.

                    <span>(Island)
On his sprawling latest offering, the rapper manages a few strong moments amid the navel-gazing and posturing
It’s been a big few weeks for bloated, endlessly teased rap opuses. Hot on the heels of empty monolith Donda from Drake’s current beefing partner, Kanye West, comes Certified Lover Boy, a 21-track, 90-minute trawl through the Canadian rap superstar’s conflicted psyche. As with his last album, 2018’s patchy Scorpion, it finds him caught between sadboi solipsism, meme-able sloganeering and demands for respect.
Things start promisingly with the undulating Champagne Poetry dextrously reflecting on loneliness (“career is going great, but now the rest of me is fading slowly”), while Papi’s Home recalls early Kanye, of all people, with its sped-up samples and laid-back flow. Later, however, that playfulness calcifies into headline-grabbing stunts; the risible Girls Want Girls finds Drake “coming out” as a lesbian, while Way 2 Sexy transposes Right Said Fred to the strip club.

A leading anti-nuclear campaign has called on a public inquiry to conduct a thorough examination of how undercover police officers infiltrated its movement at a time when it powerfully challenged government policies.
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) issued its demand after the inquiry, led by the retired judge Sir John Mitting, confirmed that police planted an undercover officer, John Kerry, in its headquarters between 1981 and 1984.

An internal investigation by the US Capitol police (USCP) has recommended disciplinary measures against six of its officers for their actions during the 6 January riot, although none will face criminal charges.
In a statement, the USCP said its office of professional responsibility had opened 38 separate investigations following the deadly attack on the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump seeking to overturn his election defeat.

The Taliban have announced that women in Afghanistan will only be allowed to study at university in gender-segregated classrooms and Islamic dress will be compulsory, stoking fears that a gender apartheid will be imposed on the country under the new regime.
On Saturday, the Taliban raised their flag over the presidential palace on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, signalling that their work governing the newly formed Islamic emirate had begun. The white banner bearing a Qur’anic verse was hoisted by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, the prime minister of the interim Taliban government.

Sharon Graham is the general secretary of Unite
Workers shouldn’t wait for Labour victory, says Unite’s Sharon Graham

It was early morning at a factory on Humberside. My campaign team were handing out leaflets as workers made their way in to work. One worker told the team: “I voted for the best candidate for the workers. And don’t ask me who, that’s between me and the ballot box – but she’s good.”
When I heard the story I knew I could win the election for Unite’s general secretary. The factory wasn’t one that had nominated me to stand in the election. We didn’t have supporters inside trying to deliver our vote. It was totally new ground for us. And there was only one woman on the ballot paper.

Sharon Graham: ‘My union will no longer rely on Labour’

Workers should not pin all their hopes on Labour winning the next election to improve pay and conditions after the Covid-19 pandemic, the new leader of one of Britain’s biggest trade unions has warned.
In a significant intervention weeks before Sir Keir Starmer’s first in-person party speech, Sharon Graham said Unite would “get back to what it says on the trade union tin” and expressed reservations about the limits of what MPs could achieve.

Iran has agreed to allow UN nuclear inspectors to install new memory cards into its cameras monitoring the country’s controversial nuclear programme in a move that could keep the inspection process on life support, and even ease a path towards a lifting of US sanctions.
Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, struck the deal in Tehran on Sunday after two hours of talks and will report to the IAEA’s board meeting on Monday.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is facing a growing revolt in parliament and the country over plans to restrict the fundamental right to protest, as controversial legislation that would increase police powers enters the House of Lords this week.
More than 350 organisations, including human rights groups, charities and faith bodies, have written to Patel and justice secretary Robert Buckland this weekend complaining that the measures would have a “profound impact” on freedom of expression, and represent “an attack on some of the most basic democratic rights of citizens”.

The return this weekend of Endeavour – ITV’s prequel to Inspector Morse – for its eighth series will thrill its seven million viewers, but co-star Roger Allam is surprised still to be around.
When he was offered a three-season contract, he recalls: “I felt a huge sinking feeling in my stomach. I refused, and in the end committed to two years.” Since then, he has taken it “a year at a time”.

Lisa Brice, Rose Wylie and Oscar Murillo are among the 31 UK-based artists united in this superb survey of painting’s deep connection to our times
A stunning image opens this show: of a small woman balancing on a towering stool to paint a substantial canvas on the wall. Look twice and you see that she is working on a picture of herself, larger than life and clearly made without any use of a mirror. Her shadow on the rear wall is larger still, and so gracefully painted by the South African artist Lisa Brice as to amount to a third portrait of this woman, namely the Dutch painter Charley Toorop (1891-1955), whose art has only recently received its due.
Brice’s triple portrait of Toorop, painted in hazy monotones, literally raises her up, enlarging upon her gifts, her self-knowledge and struggle. It is a highly intelligent hymn of praise, a spellbinding commemoration.

                    <span>The calculations behind filling supermarket shelves are dizzyingly complex – but it all starts with the x and y you know from school
Nando’s put it succinctly on its Twitter feed last month: “The UK supply chain is having a bit of a mare right now.” Getting things on to supermarket shelves, through your letterbox or into a restaurant kitchen has certainly become problematic of late. It’s hard to know exactly where to pin the blame, though Covid and Brexit have surely played a part. What we can do is give thanks for algebra, because things would be so much worse without it.
It’s likely that you have mixed feelings about algebra. Even if you could knuckle down and manage it in school, you probably wondered why it was important to solve an equation involving x raised to the power of 2 or why you should want to find a and b when a + b &#x3D; 3 and 2a – b &#x3D; 12. You might even feel that your scepticism has been vindicated: the chances are that you have never done algebra in your post-school life. But that doesn’t mean that the jumble of letters, numbers and missing things that we call algebra is useless. Whether it’s supermarket groceries, a new TV or a parcel from Aunt Emily, they all reach your home through some attempt to solve an equation and find the missing number. Algebra is the maths that delivers.

Companies included on the government’s approved Covid-19 travel test provider list appear to be flouting consumer law by refusing to refund customers for unfulfilled orders, according to dozens of travellers who have contacted the Guardian.
Boots is among the firms whose terms and conditions state that orders for tests are non-refundable even if they fail to materialise despite the Consumer Rights Act allowing customers to claim money back if an order or service is not as described or fit for purpose.

Business was nearly back to usual for a high-spirited final Prom with lively soloists Stuart Skelton and accordionist Ksenija Sidorova; while it was the impact of Brexit rather than Covid that was a focus of protest
The Last Night of this year’s Proms marked a return to something akin to its usual form: the high spirits, the patriotism and jingoism, the flags, balloons and bunting. Yet this was also a Last Night in which the pandemic made its presence very much felt. There were no Proms in the Park, though prerecorded contributions were beamed in from Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Social distancing meant that the 18-strong BBC Singers were joined in the second half by 19 members of the BBC Symphony Chorus – a tacit reminder that while a packed, largely unmasked audience can bellow its head off in Land of Hope and Glory, full choirs still remain cautiously inhibited.

                    <span>Kristen Stewart’s nod to the shalwar kameez in Venice last week points to fashion’s first post-pandemic trend
When Kristen Stewart wore pale jade-coloured Chanel trousers under a dress at the Venice film festival last week, comments on the Instagram page of Stewart’s stylist Tara Swennen included: “She looks great but looks like she’s wearing pyjamas. Chanel really?” 
But now, as normal life flickers into view, the style – a western appropriation of the shalwar kameez – has emerged as the first post-pandemic trend. Nicknamed “double duty” by Harper’s Bazaar, the silhouette, which has also been seen on the catwalks of Louis Vuitton and Fendi, speaks to our hybrid lives and the liminal state we still find ourselves in when it comes to thinking about our clothes after 18 months of pandemic living.

                    <span>The Pentagon has been quietly investigating unidentified flying objects since 2007. The fact that they think they might exist is good news to those who claim to have seen them
In June, the US government published a long-awaited report into UFOs. Although the report did not, as many had hoped, admit to the existence of little green men, it did reveal that not only were objects appearing in our skies that the Pentagon – which controls the US military – could not explain, but some clearly pose “a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to US national security”.
The Pentagon also revealed that it has been taking UFOs so seriously that in 2007 it discreetly set up the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which has been gathering data on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) ever since.

                    <span>Wintringham primary academy, St Neots
You won’t find any little rows of government-sanctioned classroom cells at this new Cambridgeshire primary school, whose bright, timber-built design lets the outdoors in
It shouldn’t be controversial that schools should be well designed: that the spaces where much of everyone’s childhoods are spent should, as a minimum, be well lit, well proportioned and well planned; that there should be signs of care and glimmers of human spirit in their design and construction; that there might be reminders of nature in the materials and the views out. Even if narrow educational outcomes are your only concern, there’s evidence that these are helped by the quality of school environments.
This point should not be lost, in particular, on a government whose members, in many cases, experienced the handsome architecture of private schools and Oxbridge colleges. But lost it is. Ever since 2014, when Michael Gove was secretary of state for education, new school buildings have been subject to functionalist documents called Building Bulletins. These state, with as much aspiration and joy-in-learning as the instructions for a dishwasher, exactly how much floorspace is allotted per child, how much storage and other ancillary space, and what are the optimal layouts of zones.

                    <span>The sweetness of carrots will lift spirits at the autumn table
A fat bunch of late summer carrots, long, slim and with feathery plumes, is a sight to lift the spirits. In the kitchen, they grate without turning to mush the way the early spring varieties do, and are substantial enough to become, along with onions and celery, the backbone of the first slowly simmered dish of the autumn.
Raw or lightly steamed, the carrot’s inherent sweetness is tamed with something sour – a dash of lemon juice, a spoonful of thick yoghurt or kefir, or a tangle of red cabbage. Roasted they will soften while their edges become as chewy as toffee – a vehicle for a sharp sauce or dressing with crème fraîche or lemon oil. To modernise a retro grated carrot salad I like to add pink, lightly pickled onions, chopped lemon thyme or Japanese pickles.

                    <span>Finally recognised for its environmental benefits, the UK’s ‘Cinderella habitat’ is at the heart of a major conservation drive
Up in the blustery hills of the Yorkshire Dales on an August afternoon, conservationist Jenny Sharman points out a cottongrass plant, resembling white fluff on a stalk, in a patch of dark, almost black, peat.
“We didn’t plant that one,” she says. “It’s surprising how quickly nature responds. You just have to give it a chance to return. It’s really lovely to see.” Sharman, a peatland restoration officer with the Yorkshire Peat Partnership, led by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, is working against the clock to save the north of England’s rapidly declining bogs. It may sound like the least sexy conservation scheme on earth but bog restoration is in vogue thanks to our increasing understanding of its huge environmental benefits, including large-scale carbon capture and desperately needed flood prevention.

Frome Town FC’s charity prize draw has been cancelled. It was launched on 1 July and the aim was to raise money for Frome Town FC and local food banks. The winner of the draw would get a SsangYong Tivoli car (me neither). There were two ways of entering: either by donating £5 or by not doing so. If you chose the latter option, you had to send in a postcard.
You’ve probably spotted the flaw in the system. In Frome Town’s defence, it’s all because of the law. Unless you offer a free entry option in this kind of draw, you run into a load of gambling legislation because you’re running a lottery or starting a casino or something, which involves all sorts of licences and legal wrangles and text messages to Robert Jenrick before you can go ahead.

It’s the hottest week of the year and I am sitting in a windowless room on the lower ground floor of London’s University College Hospital discussing the precise temperature of frozen sperm. At -196C, these glacial swimmers are biologically inert, I’m told, as I’m handed two props: a thin plastic straw that bends to the will of my fingertips and a cylindrical cup segmented by colourful tubes – blue, green, purple, orange, red – that gives this storage container the look of a rainbow-hued toy, a playful wagon wheel you might buy for a child.
“Is this how you imagined it?” the manager of the fertility laboratory asks me – “it” being the process of posthumous sperm banking. I can’t quite find the words to answer that, no, this isn’t what I imagined at all because when I close my eyes, I think of poppy seeds and ice cubes. And that, at the age of 38, this isn’t the way my story was supposed to go.

As part of his same drive to inspire children to exercise, Wicks is bringing out, with the writer Vivian French and illustrator Paul Howard, a picture book, The Burpee Bears, on 30 September.
Were your own kids an inspiration for your new series?
Massively – I’m always exercising in front of them, although my little boy, Marley, is only 18 months old. I also have a three-year-old girl, Indie, and love it when she copies me… The other day we were doing The Workout Badges, and she said: “Dad, you’ve got to keep going because if you stop, you won’t get your badge!” My passion is with helping young people – through exercise – to change the way they feel.

                    <span>We now know so much more about the virus. But we are failing to act on the knowledge
All the signs are that Boris Johnson will this week unveil a winter plan for Covid. Already, coronavirus deaths are running at around 1,000 a week, and the numbers of hospital admissions are growing slowly but steadily. Staff are exhausted and the outlook for the autumn and winter cannot be regarded as anything other than unsettled, uncertain and potentially very dangerous.
The government and its senior officials claim Covid should be regarded as similar to influenza and that we have to “learn to live with it”. This worryingly persistent and flawed approach ignores the hazardous and evolving nature of the virus. Perhaps the worst manifestation is the UK’s three-month delay in using the approved vaccines to protect children aged 12 to 15. Last week, Dr Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden, gave a lecture to a UK public health society. He strongly backed the US policy of fully vaccinating young people for three reasons. First, children spread the virus; second, we see cases of severe Covid disease in the young; and third, we don’t know the long-term effects of infection in children. With European regulatory approval for a vaccine for children aged five to 11 expected next month, the government will soon face another decision-making challenge.

“We are the 99%.” Ten years ago that unifying slogan travelled around the world. Some attribute its origin to the economist Joseph Stiglitz, who first popularised the distinction between the 1% of people with great wealth and power and the rest of us. Others say that it was the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber who coined the phrase. But everyone agrees that it went global when it was voiced by demonstrators who gathered in lower Manhattan’s financial district on 17 September 2011.
What took place that day, and the two months to follow, would become known as Occupy Wall Street, a protest movement against economic inequality and injustice that spread to 28 other US cities, to European capitals and financial centres, including London, Paris and Berlin, as well as parts of South America and the far east. In total it’s said that there were more than 750 Occupy events around the world, featuring demonstrators ranging from a few tens in some places to many thousands in others.

In view of passenger data from the US and the UK, air travel is on its way toward recovering from the slump of a pre-vaccine Covid-19 pandemic – despite the rise of the Delta variant.
But does that mean it’s a good idea to buy that plane ticket, even if you’re vaccinated? And if you’re comfortable assuming some degree of personal risk, is it unethical to do so?

                    <span>The US has now spent $8 trillion over 20 years in its response to the attacks. But the true price has been more than financial
Successive US administrations since 2001 have spent $8tn – that’s to say $8,000bn or $8 million million – on what George Bush, its progenitor, termed the “global war on terror”. Joe Biden complains that Afghanistan alone cost the US $300m a day for 20 years. These mind-boggling numbers are mere estimates. Their sheer size is hard to comprehend. In any case, it’s absurd to reckon the cost of a worldwide trauma purely in dollars and cents.
So how should a phenomenon that, looked at in the round, is the most epically damaging man-made calamity of recent times be properly measured? The overall cost of the “war on terror” can be gauged in many different ways – in terms of international development, arms spending, environmental impacts, civil and human rights, the rule of law and the balance of power. Yet most striking is the cost expressed in ordinary lives lost and ruined.

After it comes into effect in 2023, the new policy will directly help about 150,000 more people at any one time, according to government documents. But already about 850,000 older people who receive care have at least some of the cost paid by local authorities.

In two months, Parwana estimates she has crossed the threshold of her home perhaps four times. She used to leave early in the morning, for work that supported her entire family, and then go on to an evening degree course.
After the Taliban took over Kandahar, her manager told her not to come to work and her university hasn’t yet sorted out how to put on the gender-divided classes they demanded.

Out on the frontiers of the Louisiana coastline, amid winding bayous, battered island roads and sinking land, a swath of fresh devastation for this region’s overlooked Indigenous tribal communities.
Amid the rapid depletion of their land, rising sea levels and coastal erosion, Hurricane Ida pummeled the small communities of Pointe-aux-Chenes and Isle de Jean Charles, home to a number of south-east Louisiana’s coastal tribal groups.

                    <span>British photographer Bob Watkins captures a little moment of intimacy in the heat and noise of the Big Apple
Bob Watkins took this photograph of a couple in New York on his first visit to the city from England in August 1980. In the years before Mayor Giuliani’s zero-tolerance crackdown on crime, and the advance of gentrification, the city was a place of maximum tolerance, where anything could happen at any moment. For Watkins, who had specialised in photographing the ironies of Englishness and its traditions, this was both a challenge and a liberation.
That summer, he recalls, in a monograph of his pictures from that time, “both the city and myself were out of money and there was a sense of danger on every corner. Emerging from the subway on to Fifth Avenue for the first time I was assaulted by the humidity, stench and magnitude of that canyon. It was like stepping into Springsteen’s Born to Run album. Garbage and broken people filled the streets as I walked the same sidewalks as my photographic heroes and drank Dr Pepper to replace the sweat.” There were moments where the energy of the streets coalesced – “Democratic Convention rallies and Iranian hostage demonstrations added extra visual opportunities,” Watkins recalls, but it was the unpredictability of those streets that he remembers most clearly.

Restaurant names matter. If you reference hedgerows, petals and berries, you are telling us you cook only to serve nature’s bounty. You may do it brilliantly or not very well at all, but at least we know your intention before crossing the threshold. Use words related to the shore and we have an expectation of a menu built around the most recent catch. And if you call your restaurant Sexy Fish, it indicates you have the sensibility of a 14-year-old boy who gets off on the underwear ads in his mother’s copy of Cosmopolitan. If you honestly think this is a good name for a restaurant, you should be forced to sit in a locked room with a pile of rotting herring for two days. Then you can tell us how bloody sexy you think fish really are. If this reads as if I have some corrosive beef with restaurateur Richard Caring, that’s because I do; the tawdry stereotypes used to market his Ivy Asia restaurants are fully deserving of opprobrium.

If Apple is to become the world’s first three-trillion-dollar company, the iPhone will play a key role in that feat. The tech firm unveils the latest iteration of its signature product on Tuesday, and the success of the iPhone 13 will determine how quickly Apple goes from its current market capitalisation of just under $2.5tn (£1.8tn) to $3tn.
“We believe Apple is on a trajectory to hit $3tn by early 2022 and the iPhone 13 will be a lynchpin of growth,” says Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush Securities.

Victor came through qualifying and did not lose a set 

There are so many basic milestones that Emma Raducanu has not yet recorded in a professional tennis career that only began in full three months ago. She has never been a direct entrant to a grand slam main draw, she is yet to play a tour-level three set match and she has not even won a match at a WTA tour event.
Yet sometimes a special player comes along and renders convention irrelevant. After three weeks and one of the most astonishing breakout runs in living memory, Raducanu marked herself as a grand slam champion for ever. She ended the US Open where she started it: fearlessly dominating from inside the baseline as she defeated Leylah Annie Fernandez 6-4, 6-3 in a match of the highest intensity to win the title without dropping a set.

The New York artist and film-maker Rebecca Huntt makes her feature debut with this unsentimental documentary-memoir of discontent titled Beba – her childhood nickname. It reflects upon her complicated upbringing as an Afro-Latina woman whose Dominican father and Venezuelan mother aspirationally brought her and her two siblings up in a tiny apartment on Central Park West. It leaves her with issues around family dysfunction and class, especially as she had to live in this increasingly chaotic household into her adult years.

The myth of Mayo’s curse remains intact after Tyrone clinched the All-Ireland football championship title. Hopes of County Mayo winning their first title since 1951 were dashed yesterday when they lost to Tyrone.
Mayo have not won the Gaelic football final for 70 years since they beat County Meath. Legend has it that a curse was placed on the team by an enraged priest after they apparently failed to pay their respects to a funeral they passed on their homecoming journey following the victory. The story goes that the side would not win again under the curse until all the members of that team had died, as the Observer reported last week.

Up to 660,000 jobs will be at serious risk if the UK continues to fall behind other countries in the amount it invests in green infrastructure and jobs, according to an alarming study published on Saturday.
Coming just two months before Boris Johnson’s government hosts the United Nations Climate conference, COP26 in Glasgow, the report by the TUC makes clear that the impact on employment in the UK as a result of jobs moving “offshore” to countries in the vanguard of green investment and technology will be particularly acute in the UK’s industrial heartlands in the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber.

One night, Hayden Starr returned home to find his neighbours having a party. He lived in an apartment complex in Canberra, with only one other unit on his floor, its front door just “a metre apart” from his own. Keen to see who lived there, he invited himself in.
“I grabbed a cheap bottle of wine I had lying around, go in and see this delightful, lovely girl,” he says. “And that’s how I met Sophie. It was her party, but we ended up spending ages chatting and she tells me all these crazy stories. After that I was like ‘oh man, there’s something about this girl. There’s something about this neighbour of mine.’”

“I heard the news that the Taliban were coming,” he says. “They had captured Herat and Lashkar Gah and they would come to Kabul. Nothing would stop them. Everything changed. I knew I would be vulnerable.”

On 30 June 2020, Victoria’s Covid cases were doubling. Within a week the state would be in its second lockdown.
That same day Pfizer wrote to the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, with a clear sense of urgency, wanting to discuss a vaccination deal.

More than a dozen gorillas have tested positive for Covid-19 at Zoo Atlanta, probably after contracting the virus from a keeper, zoo officials said.
Staff were alerted when several of the zoo’s troop of 20 western lowland gorillas began exhibiting symptoms, including runny noses, mild coughing and loss of appetite.

After nearly 30 years serving a life sentence in a maximum-security prison inside a naval base, Guzmán died at 6.40am on Saturday due to “health complications”, Peru’s prison service confirmed.

In the early days of the 2016 US election campaign, Fang Kecheng, a former journalist at the liberal-leaning Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly and then a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, began fact-checking Donald Trump’s statements on refugees and Muslims on Chinese social media, hoping to provide additional context to the reporting of the presidential candidate back home in China. But his effort was quickly met with fierce criticism on the Chinese internet.
Some accused him of being a “white left” – a popular insult for idealistic, leftwing and western-oriented liberals; others labelled him a “virgin”, a “bleeding heart” and a “white lotus” – demeaning phrases that describe do-gooders who care about the underprivileged - as he tried to defend women’s rights.

                    <span>There was a sense of inevitability about the way it ended, even though Aston Villa never stopped trying to grab the goal their performance deserved. Everybody inside Stamford Bridge knew what to expect when César Azpilicueta charged down Chelsea’s right flank in stoppage time and slipped a pass inside to Romelu Lukaku, who only had one thing on his mind when he received the ball on the edge of the area.
If the footwork from Lukaku was impressive, the strike was even better: a rising, snorting, left-footed screamer that left Villa’s goalkeeper, Jed Steer, hopelessly grasping at thin air. It was a masterful piece of forward play from one of the deadliest strikers in the world and, as the ball soared into the net, it was not hard to see why Chelsea made prising the Belgian away from Internazionale their top priority during the summer.

“This is the day when the bad times started for Afghanistan and Afghans,” said Haizbullah, a grocer in the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban’s heartland and original capital.

Plans for Covid vaccinations for 12- to 15-year-olds across the UK are to be announced by the government this week, with a mass inoculation programme beginning in schools within two weeks, the Observer has been told.
New proposals for a Covid booster programme are also expected to be set out on Tuesday, but it is thought ministers may be backing away from plans for Covid passports in confined settings such as nightclubs amid opposition from some Tory MPs.

The latest and, most likely, last trial of Robert Durst, the wily, silver-tongued New York real estate heir who has spent half a lifetime seeking to explain away a string of shocking deaths in his midst, was always going to be a lurid affair. But the reality – of murder, dismemberment, kooky disguises and a compulsion to talk about it all – has outstripped all expectations.
Over the past four months, a court in suburban Los Angeles has heard Durst, now 79 and in poor health, repeatedly admitting that he was a liar and a perjurer. Even he, he said, had difficulty believing the central alibi for the murder at the heart of the case.

Social media did not create informers and liars. The malicious have always manufactured denunciations and the literal-minded have always confused nuance with sin. The web is simply supercharging one of those dismal moments in history when wilful ignorance and active malice are rewarded rather than disdained.
In optimistic times, one can almost sympathise with character assassins. In Normal People, Sally Rooney has her female lead think, “cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently”. The victim may get over it. The abuser must always live with the knowledge that they are a thug.

On Saturday activists overwhelmingly supported a motion demanding the creation of a Scottish national energy company, which first minister Nicola Sturgeon first promised in October 2017 at a previous conference.

                    <span>The author of Fates and Furies on being endorsed by Barack Obama, the climate crisis and discovering medieval humour for a new novel about 12th-century poet Marie de France
Lauren Groff, 43, grew up in Cooperstown, New York, a place she fictionalised as a picture-perfect town in her bestselling debut novel, The Monsters of Templeton (2008). Her second novel, Arcadia (2012), explored the failure of utopian communities in the 1970s, and her third, Fates and Furies, about an unconventional marriage, was picked by Barack Obama as his favourite book of 2015. In 2018, she produced her first short story collection, Florida. Her latest novel, Matrix, is an inventive tale of 12th-century nunnery focusing on Marie de France, considered the first woman to write poetry (known as “lais”) in French. Groff now lives in Gainesville, Florida with her husband, Clay Kallman, and two children.
What made you want to write about Marie de France?
I’ve always loved her. I studied French and English in college and for a while I thought I wanted to be a medievalist. I love chivalric romances and I love that period. To be honest, I was trying to write a novel about the contemporary world but it was so overwhelming that I didn’t feel I had enough distance to do justice to this incredibly complicated and difficult time that we’re living through. I couldn’t do it in the midst of the Trump presidency with all these feelings of constant daily dread, so I had to look at things at a slant and see the roots of the contemporary world 1,000 years back.

                    <span>She was a crucial part of a cultural movement in the 1980s. Now a first solo exhibition in 15 years will allow her work to shine
From the 1980s to the early 2000s, artist and archivist Rita Keegan fervently collected and preserved newsletters, leaflets, photographs and exhibition literature from the British Black arts scene. “It [didn’t] matter how fabulous the show – if you didn’t have the ephemera, it was hard to say that you existed,” she told the Art Newspaper last summer. “It’s very easy to be written out of history, if you don’t have those pieces of paper.”
Boxes and files stored behind the sofa in Keegan’s living room and a garden “shedio” in her south London home are a portal to the past, specifically, into the seminal British Black arts movement founded in 1982. This pivotal moment in art history saw artists such as Sonia Boyce, Eddie Chambers, Denzil Forrester, Lubaina Himid and Maud Sulter galvanised to create and curate works together in the aftermath of the 1981 Brixton uprisings and in response to their marginalisation from the mainstream art world.

                    <span>Twenty years after their destruction, we can finally see  Yamasaki’s landmark pillars in all their glory
Few buildings illustrated architecture’s power to be different things to different people at different times than the twin towers of the World Trade Center. To their architect, Minoru Yamasaki, they were “a living symbol of man’s dedication to world peace”. The terrorists who destroyed them made them symbols of conflict. To a generation of New Yorkers, they represented the faceless civic-corporate bodies who razed a thriving and diverse district called Radio Row in order to build the towers. When I studied architecture, they typified vacuous modernism – the “largest radiators in the world”, said one of my tutors.
Yet the Japanese-American Yamasaki was dismissed by his contemporaries for being “dainty”, “prissy”, “epicene”, “ballet school”, for example, on account of the slender gothic-looking arcades that ran around the bases of the towers. Now, looking at the old images republished with the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the towers look stately and graceful, magically capturing the changing light, serene counterparts to the frenetic city stretched out beneath them. Not to mention pillars of the world that changed for ever with their collapse.

                    <span>If ever there was an afternoon when any win would do, then this was it. Arsenal’s performance will not live long in the memory but change has to begin somewhere and Mikel Arteta now has some sort of platform from which to develop his new-look side. They showed glimmers of genuine potential and, once Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had turned in a singularly scruffy winner midway through the second half, rarely looked in trouble. Nobody present will be left under too many illusions, though, about the amount of work required to effect a meaningful recovery.

Anyone looking for a secondhand car will pay 15% more this year than last – that is, if they can find one that suits their needs. Paying monthly energy bills is no fun since world prices rocketed. And the cost of essential services such as childcare are only increasing over time.

                    <span>“My work is always about movement, about migration,” the Chinese figurative painter Liu Xiaodong has said. Liu, who is based in Beijing, spent nearly a month in June 2019 portraying Chinese expats in London for a series called New England, recently published in book form (Nero Editions, €20). His subjects are broadly affluent – a billionaire’s daughter, a banker, a polo player – and Liu captures them in moments of downtime, sprawled on a sofa or sweaty after a game. Signs of material success can be seen in the background, but the eyes and faces of several of the subjects – betraying uncertainty, sometimes sadness – disrupt the sense that leaving China and integrating in England has been easy. “In today’s world there are conflicts and contradictions everywhere,” Liu believes. “It’s almost an artist’s duty to narrate, to depict the conflicts in the world.”

Usually the bad news is dumped late on Friday when most Muscovites are heading out for the evening: a new list of names of journalists and outlets declared “foreign agents”, a label that for some Russians evokes such Soviet-era terms as “enemy of the people” and has sent a chill through newsrooms under threat.
“We are being told that we are the enemy,” said Tikhon Dzyadko, the editor of Dozhd, Russia’s main independent television station and a recent addition to the list. “And I am not an enemy and I am not an agent. It’s a spit in the face.”

After a deeply satisfied Novak Djokovic had put his racket away following another job well done on Friday night, in the post-match interview of his five-set win over Alexander Zverev the interviewer started a question by listing all of the potential achievements on the line in his final match. As soon as Djokovic understood where the question was going, he cut the question off: “I’m going for a fourth US Open, that’s all I’m thinking about,” he said, smiling.
Further prompts about Djokovic’s grand slam attempt followed: “It’s there, it’s there,” said Djokovic. “I know that people would like to hear me talk about it, but there is not much to talk about. There’s only one match left. All in, all in. Let’s do it. I’m going to put my heart and my soul and my head into that one. I’m going to treat my next match like it is the last match of my career.”

Valtteri Bottas won the sprint qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix but in a format that is looking unwieldy and turgid he is neither race winner nor does he claim pole position. Formula One admitted it is considering once more adjusting the sprint feature of the weekend in an attempt to inject it with some excitement.
Bottas has a grid penalty, putting Max Verstappen, who was second, on pole for Sunday’s race. He is in a real position to extend his championship lead over Lewis Hamilton, who was fifth after a poor start to the 18-lap event and has conceded that Verstappen should gain an easy win.

It transpired the answer to this pointed question from the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board to his director of cricket – albeit one unlikely to have been tapped out in reply – was their players.

The victim, the newspaper said, was 43-year-old Zemari Ahmadi, who died with nine members of his family, including seven children, when a missile from a US air force Reaper drone struck his car as he arrived home from work in a residential neighborhood of Kabul.

                    <span>The long view suggests we’re due a new era, whether it is that of metaverses, blockchain or quantum computing
One of the challenges of writing about technology is how to escape from what the sociologist Michael Mann memorably called “the sociology of the last five minutes”. This is especially difficult when covering the digital tech industry because one is continually deluged with ‘new’ stuff – viral memes, shiny new products or services, Facebook scandals (a weekly staple), security breaches etc. Recent weeks, for example, have brought the industry’s enthusiasm for the idea of a “metaverse” (neatly dissected here by Alex Hern), El Salvador’s flirtation with bitcoin, endless stories about central banks and governments beginning to worry about regulating cryptocurrencies, Apple’s possible rethink of its plans to scan phones and iCloud accounts for child abuse images, umpteen ransomware attacks, antitrust suits against app stores, the Theranos trial and so on, apparently ad infinitum.
So how to break out of the fruitless syndrome identified by Prof Mann? One way is to borrow an idea from Ben Thompson, a veteran tech commentator who doesn’t suffer from it, and whose (paid) newsletter should be a mandatory daily email for any serious observer of the tech industry. Way back in 2014, he suggested that we think of the industry in terms of “epochs” – important periods or eras in the history of a field. At that point he saw three epochs in the evolution of our networked world, each defined in terms of its core technology and its “killer app”.

The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on business, gutting high streets as familiar names fell into receivership. But for some less well-known firms, the past 18 months have been transformational. Those that have thrived did so by carving out a new niche – with products as varied as Covid sequencing technology kits and surgical masks with virus-killing coatings. We asked some of them about the year everything changed.

                    <span>Big name directors at their best feature alongside daring visionaries from the farther realms of art cinema – but to whom will Bong Joon-ho’s jury award the Golden Lion?
Critics are allegedly very hard to please. There’s a joke told in the 19th-century drama Lost Illusions, which premiered in Venice this week. Two critics are in a boat when they see Jesus walking on the water. One says to the other: “Look at that – he can’t even swim.”
Yet this year on the Lido, the critics were dizzy with delight at a formidably good festival. Last year, the Mostra happened during the gap between European lockdowns, leaving viewers gratefully receptive to a superb selection – but this year’s crop, miraculously, has outdone it. The competition jury – headed by Korean maestro Bong Joon-ho and including Chloé Zhao, director of 2020’s Golden Lion winner Nomadland – will have a tough time picking the plums from this year’s cornucopia.

“We are scheduling our flights operations and initially requested the permission of three flights. We have received requests from aid agencies and journalists and services will be provided on demand basis,” Abdullah Hafeez, a spokesperson for the PIA, said.

Reports that Boris Johnson has ambitions for another decade in power as he aims to outlast Margaret Thatcher’s 11-year tenure in No 10 have been met with consternation.
The Times reported that Johnson wanted to build a legacy. One cabinet member reportedly told the newspaper: “Boris will want to go on and on. The stuff Dom [Dominic Cummings] was saying about him going off into the sunset was nonsense. He’s very competitive. He wants to go on for longer than Thatcher.”

God knows what I must have looked like: a bedraggled 25-year-old dressed as a psychedelic game hunter with glitter smeared across my face crying hysterically in a Cambridgeshire field. It was 4pm on 23 July 2011, and a friend of mine had broken the news to me: Amy was dead. I was totally inconsolable, while around me fellow-revellers danced.
It was the Saturday of Secret Garden Party and my friends had been deliberating among themselves how best to tell me. Their hands were forced when they realised it was about to be announced on the festival stage. In the end, a guy called Jamie opted for directness: “Amy Winehouse is dead.”

After 11 years in France, the couple, who work in highly skilled jobs in the defence industry, decided to move back to the UK and thought it would be as simple as getting on a Eurostar train.

When I was young, my focus wasn’t on my queerness. It was more on being south Asian. I was raised in a small town in South Yorkshire. On the way to and from school, you just didn’t know if you were going to get attacked. But I had the sanctuary of my extended family, so many incredibly kind, supportive and happy aunts, uncles and cousins. So there was a weird mix of sorrow and great joy.
I recently went on a babymoon to Iceland. I’m sure it’s the same for every parent: I worry how to raise them without them becoming little shits. We don’t know what colour our child is going to be. I’m hoping brown, but when you have a mixed-race child, who knows? [Tan and his husband have now become parents using a surrogate mother.]

Bulgarians voted in April and July but both polls resulted in fragmented legislatures. No party has been able to form a government to succeed the almost 10-year tenure of former conservative prime minister Boyko Borisov.

The sweet almond topping on this tart was inspired by toscakaka, a delightful Swedish almond cake that I fell in love with a few years ago. A buttery mix of brown sugar, toasted almonds and cream comes together to create a shell-like layer that sits on top of a soft, frangipane filling. Buckwheat flour is my go-to when seeking out a gluten-free option for pastry because it’s not too difficult to work with and brings such a nutty, earthy flavour.

As anyone who has planted tulips knows, the first year is big and bold, the second year less so. There’s the myth that most bedding types of tulips won’t reflower in their second year. I’ve found this largely untrue; it’s just that the blooms get much, much smaller.
This is because the tulips that you buy today have been fed, and fed again, to produce huge blooms. Think of them like muscle boys on protein shakes: take away the gym and the shake, and you quickly get something smaller.

Amid the excitement of 4,000 people meeting face to face at the IUCN’s world conservation congress in the French port city, with more participating online, there was broad agreement that conservation is experiencing a moment of opportunity, despite obvious challenges, and that essential work has not stopped under lockdowns.

                    <span>Billed as the most secure phone on the planet, An0m became a viral sensation in the underworld. There was just one problem for anyone using it for criminal means: it was run by the police
The rain pattered lightly on the harbour of the Belgian port city of Ghent when, on 21 June 2021, a team of professional divers slipped below the surface into the emerald murk. The Brazilian tanker, heavy with fruit juice bound for Australia, had already crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but its journey wasn’t halfway done as the divers felt their way along the barnacled serration of its hull. They were looking for the sea chest, a metallic inlet below the water line, through which the ship draws seawater to cool its engines. Tucked inside, they found what they were looking for: three long sacks, each wrapped in a thick black plastic bag and trussed with black and white striped nautical rope.
The sacks were heavy. Each one weighed as much as a sheep and, shaped like a body bag, could feasibly have contained one. As the Belgian police opened the first bag, a stack of crimson bricks slid out. Had this cargo reached Australia, where high demand and meagre supply has pushed the price of a kilo of cocaine to eight times its equivalent cost in North America, the haul would have been worth more than A$64m (£34m).

Dr Stephanie Coen, assistant professor in health geography at Nottingham University, is eager to get back to teaching in person. But she fears that with students not required to wear masks when classes start in a few weeks, squeezing them like “sardines” into her tiny room for seminars will be unsafe.
“Some of our Covid safety material talks about respecting people’s choices. But this isn’t about personal choice, it is about public health. It is about caring for each other.”

                    <span>I was in the city for fashion week, and while many memories have faded, odd details remain – along with the shock and sorrow
Over the past two decades, 9/11 has taken on all kinds of different meanings for people, from the end of American dominance to the rise of a new kind of terrorism. But when I think of 9/11, the first thing I think of is Tracey Ullman.
I was born and raised in New York City, but I only happened to be there that day because it was New York fashion week, and the Guardian had sent me over from London to cover it for the first time. I was 23 years old. Look at me, Ma, a proper grownup now, getting sent overseas to write news stories! I was due to fly back the evening of 11 September 2001, and only had one show to cover that day, so I treated myself to room service (so grownup) while I watched one of those morning news shows that are really just celebrity interview shows, interspersed occasionally with the headlines. I was delighted when the guest that morning was Tracey Ullman, whom I’ve always liked. So there I was, eating my breakfast, listening to Ullman, feeling content with the world and totally in control of my life. Then the next interview started, with someone who had written a celebrity biography, and the presenter suddenly interrupted proceedings. A plane, he said, had flown into the north tower of the World Trade Center. Huh, that’s weird, I thought, not especially concerned, because despite feeling like an adult, I was still really a child.

The 2022 university rankings

Tuition fees from British students alone fail to meet the costs of undergraduate courses at University College London, its provost has revealed, forcing UCL and other universities to rely on fees from international students.
Michael Spence, UCL’s provost, said no undergraduate courses at his university could be funded by domestic fees of £9,250 a year, with UCL having to spend up to £90m extra last year to support teaching during the pandemic.

Labour is warning that Rishi Sunak will be personally responsible for the largest benefit cut in the history of the welfare state, if the £20-a-week reduction in universal credit goes ahead next month.
The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, urged the chancellor to heed the warnings of charities, anti-poverty campaigners and six former work and pensions secretaries and reverse the planned cut, which will affect almost 6m households.

After this week’s performance by the Labour party, I say – more in sorrow than in anger – that we can’t go on like this, something’s urgently got to give.
It’s more than a year since a new leadership was elected, but the Labour response to Boris Johnson’s social care announcement demonstrated starkly just how far the party leadership is from having a strategy to deal with him or knowing how to respond to the new political battleground.

Third set: Djokovic 4-6 6-2 1-0 Zverev* (*denotes next server)
Well now. Zverev’s power keeps Djokovic on the run and wraps up two big points. Djokovic takes the next two, but Zverev forces Djokovic to go wide and gets up toward the net for an easy backhand volley and a break point. 
 1.49am BST 
End second set: *Djokovic 4-6 6-2 Zverev (*denotes next server)
Just when you think Zverev has rebounded from his early-set difficulties, he opens this game with an error and a double fault. He follows with an ace, then hits a cross-court shot wide to give Djokovic two break points. He erases the first with an ace. But then he sends a simple backhand long, and that’s another break for Djokovic in a set in which the Grand Slam contender was able to coast while his challenger came unglued.

While Charlie Appleby’s Irish Derby winner is a worthy favourite, whether he is a worthy odds-on favourite is more debatable. The extra two and a half furlongs on Saturday is an unknown, while on their Derby form at Epsom, Hurricane Lane has something to find with Mojo Star.

Jürgen Klopp had earlier hit out at Fifa over confusion

Premier League clubs have been cleared to play their Brazilian players this weekend after the country’s football federation dropped its demand that Fifa impose the five-day rule. The news follows several days of negotiations between the Premier League and Fifa with Chile, Paraguay and Mexico following suit.
It means Liverpool will be able to call upon Alisson and Fabinho for Sunday’s trip to Leeds, with Raphinha also set to feature for the hosts. The other Brazilian players who were under threat of not playing were Manchester City’s Ederson and Gabriel Jesus, Thiago Silva at Chelsea, and Fred at Manchester United.

                    <span>The country’s goal of eliminating Covid transmission looks within reach – but health experts’ optimism is cautious
 Less than a month ago, New Zealanders disappeared into their homes, retracting from the public domain like spilled water into a dry sponge. The motorways and city streets stood mostly empty, shops closed, schools and playgrounds were deserted. A single case of the highly contagious Delta variant had been detected and the government called a snap level-4 lockdown, introducing some of the strictest restrictions in the world.
It was a new threat for a country whose Covid-zero pandemic response had been ranked one of the best globally. New Zealand had never faced a Delta outbreak before, and no one knew if its past strategies would prove up to the task.

Four of the nine injured are in serious condition, according to the authorities. A hospital helicopter from nearby Lampedusa island was initially unable to reach the island to provide assistance because of the bad weather.

A US district judge has dealt a blow to Apple’s business model by ruling that it cannot prevent app developers from including links that allow users to buy items outside the Apple App Store. The App Store is highly profitable for the tech firm, with analysts estimating that it makes annual revenues of about $20bn (£14m) and has a profit margin of 75%.

According to a ministry statement on Friday, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, claimed Russia “possesses irrefutable evidence of the violation of Russian legislation by American digital giants in the context of the preparation and conduct of elections to the state Duma”.

                    <span>An opening two-hander between Davies as a crime scene cleaner and Helena Bonham Carter as a murderer strikes an odd tone – but their quality and ambition just about save the day
The Cleaner (BBC One) is a strange creation, and – while intriguing – it may turn out to be an acquired taste. Loosely inspired by the German comedy series Der Tatortreiniger (Crime Scene Cleaner), it is written by Greg Davies, who also stars as Paul “Wicky” Wickstead, a cleaner sent to mop up the messes left behind after gruesome killings and untimely deaths. (The title and setup slightly spoil the first joke, where he arrives as if he is a detective, only to slap down his tray of solvents and cloths.) Each week, Wicky visits a different house; each week he deals with a different “client”, to put business-speak to deservedly macabre use.
In this opening episode he is tasked with making a suburban kitchen look normal again after a murder, rather than the way it looks as he arrives, which is as if someone has shoved a cow in a blender and used the results as wallpaper paste. He soon finds himself engaged in a game of cat and mouse with “the Widow”, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who is phenomenally watchable in just about everything she does, including this. Here, she is at peak HBC – dishevelled, reaching for madness, and in a stylishly oversized coat. The Widow stabbed her husband 38 times. “You only need five stabs,” Wicky grumbles. “Anything else is showboating.”

By defeating Maria Sakkari, the 17th seed, 6-1, 6-4 on Thursday, Raducanu became the first qualifier in history to reach a grand slam final. She has done so in only her fourth tour-level event since she started her full-time professional tennis career after finishing her A-levels in the summer.

A tattoo’s permanence was once considered part of the package, equally a source of frisson-like appeal and finger-wagging peril. But as tattoo removal grows more commonplace, many of those associations are now in flux.
In recent years the laser removal process – which breaks up the ink into smaller fragments that can be spirited away by the body – has been embraced by many of the celebrities who helped cement body art’s 2010s pop culture ascendancy, from the Kardashians to the Osbournes. Recently, Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson set about scrubbing his famously inked frame – which spans the gamut from stoner gags to famous exes – in order to pursue more film roles.

In London that day, writing for daily newspapers for an Australia mostly asleep during the attacks on the twin towers and the Pentagon, watching the TV live when the second aircraft struck, the myriad hot media and political takes about what it meant and what must happen next only added to confusion.
There seemed but one certainty on that day when the terrorists turned passenger jets into ballistic missiles against America. It was that the United States, always the righteous, ever the good, would retaliate disproportionately against whoever was responsible.

                    <span>Minerva theatre, Chichester
This tale of a claustrophobic mother-daughter relationship takes contrived turns, but the starkly moving performances remain compelling
Much has changed in Ireland since Martin McDonagh’s black comedy premiered in 1996, but the ramshackle Connemara hillside where this savage mother-daughter psychodrama plays out feels both petrified in perpetual darkness and newly, terribly, resonant.
This corner of Leenane – malodorous, ragged and inhabited by left-behinds – seems to be in a state of existential lockdown and every character emanates claustrophobic isolation. Maureen (Orla Fitzgerald), the middle-aged virgin living a ball-and-chain existence with her mother Mag (Ingrid Craigie) is its tortured heart, eaten up by rage and resentment towards the scheming, needy Mag.

                    <span>Australia’s plant-based meat market is booming, with increasingly sophisticated production techniques aimed at earning a place on carnivores’ plates
On an industrial road in Coburg, in Melbourne’s north, there’s a tale of two facilities. Both are filled with razor-sharp industrial slicers, grinders, hundreds of long needles to pump marinades, and machines that fill and twist silky alginate casings, made from refined seaweed, to produce up to 400 sausages a minute.
One turns out beef patties and butterflied lamb legs, mainly destined for national supermarkets. The adjacent, newer plant has almost identical equipment but no meat at all.

                    <span>His Manchester United return feels like a statement of power from a man who has cultivated a brand of individualistic devotion
In the aftermath of Cristiano Ronaldo’s shock return to Manchester United last week, there was a good deal of feverish speculation about whether he would reclaim the famous No 7 shirt once worn by United legends such as George Best, Bryan Robson and Eric Cantona, and which now forms a central part of his “CR7” personal brand.
But there was more than iconography and nostalgia involved here. The No 7 shirt already had an occupant: striker Edinson Cavani, and under Premier League rules Cavani was required to retain it for the season. Yet when you are as famous as Ronaldo, it turns out that there is an extent to which you can make up your own rules. When you see something you want, you don’t get too hung up on niceties and boundaries. You take it, as firmly and assuredly as if it had been yours all along.

                    <span>An all-star cast and some showstoppingly horrible hair can’t save Ridley Scott’s medieval epic
Duelling got Ridley Scott into cinema back in 1977 with his much-admired debut The Duellists, but that was a brisk affair of rapiers at dawn. Medieval jousting is likely to be more cumbersome and clanking, and so it is in The Last Duel. Scott is revered as one of cinema’s most versatile mainstreamers but, barring Gladiator, his historical epics have tended not to win much adoration – something that is unlikely to change with this account of a real-life 14th-century case of rape and rivalry.
The feud is between nobles Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), who fall out after the latter wins the favour of Count Pierre d’Alençon (Ben Affleck), with De Carrouges losing his destined captaincy and a desired piece of land, part of his promised dowry in his marriage to Marguerite de Thibouville (Jodie Comer). The film begins in 1386, with the men beginning armoured combat in front of King Charles VI, then jumps back to trace the story up to the point when Marguerite tells her husband that Le Gris has raped her.

Labour has apologised for briefly placing the chair of its youth wing, Jess Barnard, under investigation for “hostile or prejudiced” behaviour, saying this was an error that happened amid an attempt to clear a backlog of complaints.
Barnard was recently involved in a public row with Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, about the group’s participation in Labour’s annual conference later this month.

Five of the animals broke free from a private farm in Prince George county more than a week ago and have been roaming neighbourhoods south of Upper Marlboro in a search of food.

A document filed in a US court on Friday showed that paperwork for Giuffre’s lawsuit was filed at Andrew’s home, Royal Lodge, in Windsor on 27 August. The affidavit was accepted by a Metropolitan police officer at the gates of the property at 9.30am, after the agent filing the document had been turned away the previous day, according to the documents.

Finn to start main race from back of grid after power unit change

Valtteri Bottas qualified in first place to take the front of the grid for Formula One’s second trial of its sprint race format at the Italian Grand Prix, forcing Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton into second place.
In the week his Mercedes departure was confirmed, however, any consolation Bottas might have taken from the win was tempered by more ill-fortune. Bottas had to take a full new power unit beyond Mercedes’ allocation before qualifying, and will start from the back of the grid in Sunday’s main race regardless of how he performs on Saturday.

A common refrain in the days after 11 September 2001 was that the scenes of unthinkable destruction looked like a movie. In some ways, it did: the World Trade Center had been destroyed on-screen in three late-90s blockbusters: Independence Day, Deep Impact and Armageddon. Overnight, movies with bombastic scenes of mass violence all but disappeared; for years afterwards, the attacks themselves, whose imagery saturated the national consciousness, proved too traumatic, too untouchable, to be reimagined for film or TV.

Like everyone playing in the Refugee Council XI on Thursday, Khalid had been displaced from Afghanistan. Here at Beckenham sports ground he and his teammates were playing a side made up of faith leaders, human rights lawyers and the odd ringer. If you were hunting for an image of sport as a force for good, you wouldn’t find one more picturesque: a lush green outfield, a vicar taking a hat-trick, a rabbi fasting in the field; Chris Lewis, the former England all-rounder, donning blue latex gloves and serving refreshments; young refugees finding a place of belonging in their new home.

Google has been illegally underpaying thousands of temporary workers in dozens of countries and delayed correcting the pay rates for more than two years as it attempted to cover up the problem, the Guardian can reveal.
Google executives have been aware since at least May 2019 that the company was failing to comply with local laws in the UK, Europe and Asia that mandate temporary workers be paid equal rates to full-time employees performing similar work, internal Google documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian show.

Healthy boys may be more likely to be admitted to hospital with a rare side-effect of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine that causes inflammation of the heart than with Covid itself, US researchers claim.
Their analysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with Covid over a four-month period.

Here’s a tense single-location thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, remade from Gustav Möller’s hugely admired Danish movie Den Skyldige (The Guilty) with a little more Hollywood gloss and based on the time-honoured premise of the 911 emergency operator taking a nail-biting call from a female kidnap victim who is pretending to her abductor that she is speaking to her infant daughter, and having to speak in code. (Brad Anderson’s 2013 film The Call – starring Halle Berry as the operator – had a comparable idea.)

GPs in England are “finding it increasingly hard to guarantee safe care” for millions of patients as a shortage of medics means they are unable to cope with soaring demand, Britain’s top family doctor has warned.
Amid a debate over access to face-to-face appointments, Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP), defended the growing use of remote consultations during the pandemic.

                    <span>The devastating al-Qaida attack, and America’s response, had far-reaching consequences which are still developing
A new and deadly era began when the planes sliced into the twin towers on the morning of 11 September 2001. That evening, the historian Tony Judt wrote that he had seen the 21st century begin. The nearly 3,000 lives stolen by al-Qaida were only a small part of the toll. The horror began a chain of events that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, including huge numbers of civilians abroad and many US military personnel. It is still unfolding.
If the killing of the plot’s mastermind Osama bin Laden a few months before the 10th anniversary perhaps let some hope that an end to that new era might be in sight, there can be no such false confidence at the 20th. The establishment of a Taliban government in Kabul, two decades after the US ousted the militants for harbouring Bin Laden, has underscored two things: that far from reasserting its global supremacy, the US looks more vulnerable today; and that the echoes of 9/11 are still reverberating across the region – but will not stay there.

                    <span>The Ig Nobels are a reminder that Jonathan Swift was wrong about reason. Without research driven by curiosity, there would be far fewer breakthroughs
In Gulliver’s Travels, Jonathan Swift mocked the assumption that the scientific revolution had transformed European culture for the better. The satirical novel, published in 1726, has its eponymous hero stumbling upon “the Academy” in the fictional city of Lagado, and pokes fun at the idea that a scientific temperament could be useful. Swift describes pointless experiments to extract sunbeams from cucumbers and to build houses from the roof downwards. His book is laced with sardonic wit. But unorthodox, even absurd, thinking is necessary for science to progress.
That point has been underlined by this week’s winners of the Ig Nobel prize, established in 1991 by an American magazine called the Annals of Improbable Research. One of the honoured investigations this year was by Robin Radcliffe, of Cornell University, who looked at whether it was safer to transport an anesthetised rhinoceros upside down airborne or lying on its side on a sledge. Prof Radcliffe showed animals’ health would not be jeopardised by being hung by their legs beneath a helicopter, a technique becoming more popular in African conservation.

A constant stream of excited fans of “Britain’s most unlikely farmer” arrive on a daily basis in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds, waiting in line at least an hour to buy milk, honey and vegetables from the small shop they have travelled the length of the country – and some, across the world – to visit.

PC Declan Jones, 30, was convicted of assaulting a 44-year-old cyclist and a 15-year-old boy on two consecutive days in Birmingham, and was sacked earlier this week for gross misconduct, having been suspended since May last year.

Ben Rhodes was a US deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration

Foreign policy, for better or worse, is always an extension of a nation’s domestic politics. The arc of America’s war in Afghanistan is a testament to this reality – the story of a superpower that overreached, slowly came to terms with the limits of its capacity to shape events abroad, and withdrew in the wake of raging dysfunction at home. Viewed through this prism, President Joe Biden’s decisive yet chaotic withdrawal comes into focus.
The story begins with trauma and hubris. On September 11 2001, American power was at its high-water mark. The globalisation of open markets, democratic governance, and the US-led international order had shaped the previous decade. The spectre of nuclear war had been lifted, the ideological debates of the 20th century settled. To Americans, mass violence was something that took place along the periphery of the post-cold war world. And then suddenly, the periphery struck the centres of American power, killing thousands.

It’s harder to know exactly who to be angry at, though.

The pilgrims had been attending the annual celebration of the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, in the Ukrainian city of Uman, where Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who founded the Hasidic Breslov sect in the early 19th century, is buried. He was a great-grandson of the founder of Hasidism.

                    <span>Social care should be fully returned to the public sector, writes David Hinchliffe, while Pam Clarke says privatisation has been a failed experiment and Roger Fisken says Labour should defend high taxes for decent public service provision
Your editorial concerning Boris Johnson’s announcement on health and social care funding (7 September) rightly draws attention to the detrimental effects of the organisational split between two branches of the same tree. The ludicrous situation of having free care on one side and charges on the other is made even more laughable when no one is able to establish the division between the two with any certainty.
Pre-Tony Blair, the Labour party was seriously looking at the idea of a formal merger between the NHS and social care, and the principle has been endorsed by the Commons’ health committee on a number of occasions. The extension of universal taxpayer-funded provision to enable free social care hasn’t just been a problem for the Conservatives, but also for New Labour. However, alongside a gradual return of social care to the public sector, it is the only way to effectively address what Johnson terms the “crisis” in the sector, and your editorial correctly points out how this could be funded.

                    <span>The prime minister promises to ‘level up’, yet his policies will level down. That gives the opposition a chance they should seize
What do you do when your sworn enemy insists on wearing your clothes? The question looms large after a week when Boris Johnson once again dressed himself up in deepest red, introducing a new tax that aims to raise £12bn a year to tackle the NHS backlog and fix social care, the sort of high-tax, high-spend move that was once anathema to the Conservative party and the exclusive preserve of Labour.
But it’s a question Johnson has been posing for his opponents for much longer. In the 2019 election, he won seats that had historically voted Labour with promises of “levelling up” that were premised on a big, active state, ditching Margaret Thatcher’s blue twinset for a slash of Labour red. Indeed, ideological cross-dressing has been a thread through Johnson’s career. He was twice elected mayor in Labour-dominated London thanks in part to a range of red accessories, including support for an amnesty for undocumented migrants, all swiftly discarded when they fell out of fashion.

The existence of adult social care waiting lists is deeply shocking (Nearly 300,000 on adult social care ‘waiting lists’ in England, 8 September). Children’s social care has also taken a terrible turn this week.
New legislation has come into force which rations care on the basis of age. The law now requires that children in care always receive day‑to-day care and supervision where they live, but only if they are aged 15 and younger. No such guarantee has been given to 16- and 17-year-olds, who are increasingly placed into accommodation without any adult carers and only occasional support.

Sir Ken Olisa, the first black lord-lieutenant for London, revealed to Channel 4 that he had discussed racism with members of the royal household in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in the US. Asked whether the palace supported BLM, Olisa said: “The answer is easily yes.”

For months, Boris Johnson’s plan to deliver on a pledge to solve the social care crisis was shrouded in secrecy: names were added one by one to a list held by the cabinet secretary of those brought in to develop parts of the policy so that in the event of a leak inquiry, he knew – in the words of one insider – “who to pin against the wall”.
Even the day before the announcement, many cabinet ministers were still in the dark. The key architects – the prime minister; the chancellor, Rishi Sunak; the health secretary, Sajid Javid – had been frantically negotiating a final settlement over the weekend that was just ambitious enough for their nervous colleagues to swallow.

Britain must head into an “uncertain” winter fully prepared for a new wave of the pandemic, Boris Johnson will warn next week as he unveils a blueprint to avoid shutting schools and pubs again.
The prime minister’s Covid winter plan will set out “contingency” measures – which could involve the reintroduction of some nationwide restrictions such as social distancing or masks – that would come into force if case numbers and hospitalisations begin to overwhelm the NHS again.

Fast food chains are running out of chicken. Hauliers’ wage bills are going through the roof. Crops are rotting in the fields. The scale of Britain’s supply chain meltdown is the worst since the 1970s, when the three-day week, power cuts and industrial disputes saw rubbish pile up in the streets.
Fast forward four decades and the shortages in modern Britain stem from Covid-19 disrupting an intricate network of global supply chains where the slightest problem throws the whole system. Brexit has added to the rebooted anarchy in the UK, with years of chronic underinvestment in people and infrastructure, both from government and business, painfully exposed.

With Clarence House braced for any further accusations, and Charles said to be surprised, shocked and previously unaware of a leaked letter apparently showing Fawcett, 58, pledging to support the applications on behalf of Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, police were asked to examine claims of a possible breach of the Honours (prevention of abuses) Act 1925.

Australia’s covert overseas spy agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, opened a base in Santiago to assist in the US Central Intelligence Agency’s destabilisation of the Chilean government ahead of the bloody military coup against Salvador Allende’s socialist government 48 years ago today.
Declassified Australian government documents prove that in December 1970 Liberal foreign minister and later prime minister, Billy McMahon, approved an Asis request to open the base. For 18 months from 1971, according to the US-based National Security Archive, Asis apparently conducted covert operations in Chile – including handling CIA-recruited Chilean assets in Santiago and filing intelligence reports to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

I’m worried about my mum. She’s in her early 80s, has mobility problems and seems depressed. Every phone call with her usually ends with her sobbing or getting angry. She doesn’t like her GP and isn’t in touch with them much. I think her health and mobility could be improved with treatment, but she says there’s no point bothering anyone.
She gets angry a lot and bickers at my stepdad, who seems quite long-suffering. When I visit, she usually gets upset when I leave and then cries. She seems lonely, but not keen to reach out to her friends – she appears to feel that people should always call her, not that she should call them. She doesn’t have any hobbies and is frustrated by her lack of mobility. When I try to suggest things she could do, she says it’s all “pointless”.

Boris Johnson’s taxation plans may have sailed through the Commons, but that doesn’t mean they’re sitting well with his party. Instead, the prime minister’s push to define a new centre ground has put him at loggerheads with some of his oldest supporters. The politician they had put their faith in to usher in a new era of free market conservatism is treading a path that goes against their values – and what they had envisaged when he entered No 10.
Since Johnson used his first week back after the summer recess to break not one but two manifesto pledges – raising national insurance and reneging on the pensions triple lock for a year – a backlash is under way that goes well beyond the House of Commons.

At the last Met Gala, in 2019, Lady Gaga made four costume changes on the red carpet. Rihanna, whose past Met Gala looks have included a giant “omelette” dress and a pope costume, has sent out invites to an after-party.
But despite the outlandish fashion, the night will have a serious message as the gala opening of what is set to be the most politically charged fashion exhibition ever staged by a major museum.

Bezos was this month reported to be a significant investor in Altos Labs, an age-reversal firm which is on the scientific quest for immortality. Among other expansions, it is thought the firm will now open a lab within the UK, which I think you’ll agree means so much more to our nation than a fair tax contribution from Amazon. You know we’d only spend that shit on social care or the NHS or something, when Jeff can see it’s far better for us to get people on ordinary incomes to pay extra for all that, so that guys like him are freed up to spaff their money on Earth’s most preposterous midlife crises. How else to interpret the fact that this eternal-life news emerged in the very week it was revealed that despite Amazon UK sales increasing by £1.89bn last year, the firm paid just £3.8m more corporation tax?

Once you pop you can’t stop, it seems, with Britons increasingly hooked on fidget toys that mimic the joy of popping bubble wrap over and over again.
Retailers have shifted 5m pop its or fidget poppers since stores reopened in April, confirming the toy as the biggest craze since fidget spinners swept through the playground in 2017 and one that is likely to run until Christmas.

The consumer watchdog has called for much tougher government vetting of private companies selling Covid-19 tests to travellers, following revelations about poor service from “rogue” operators that it said had resulted in a lottery for customers.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the market for PCR tests, in which private businesses apply for inclusion on a government-approved list, was not working and risked causing a “race to the bottom” among companies touting for customers.

                    <span>Jack O’Connell faces down Stephen Graham in a rousing drama that requires no deep thought and provides fathomless fun
It is September, and time for the televisual equivalent of 40 denier tights, sweaters and defiantly unsalady food at last. BBC Two has provided it, in the form of five-part series The North Water, directed by Andrew Haigh and adapted by him from Ian McGuire’s book of the same name.
It’s got just what you need as the nights draw in. The plot is a meaty, satisfying stew that is not going to trouble your mental digestion. We are in Hull in 1859 and we open with a group of boys poking a dead dog with sticks, and a sexual tryst between a man and a lady of the night. The man in question is a black-hearted drunkard named Henry Drax (Colin Farrell, burdened by the kind of wig that should have been outlawed by the Hague by now).

Ron Snaith felt like part of his life was missing last year. Now retired after four decades as a shipbuilder and joiner in the north-east of England, he would normally spend his summer evenings kitted up and training hard. “When the Great North Run sign goes up on the Tyne Bridge, that means it’s only a week or two away,” says Snaith, 66. “It sends a shiver down your spine.”
To the disappointment of about 55,000 runners, the sign for the event did not go up in 2020. “It was a bit of a damp squib,” says Snaith, referring not just to the run itself but the absence of group training sessions and the annual socials that also fell victim to Covid.

Ravina Shamdasani, the UN’s rights spokesperson, told a briefing in Geneva that it had also received reports of house-to-house searches for those who participated in the protests.

 Britain’s trade with the EU fell sharply in July, with Brexit and the global pandemic driving exports £1.7bn lower than in July 2018 and imports falling by £3bn, according to official data.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was largely driven by declines in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which have been particularly hit by the need for separate regulatory approval post Brexit.

Scientists would make swifter progress in solving the world’s problems if they learned to put their egos aside and collaborate better, according to the leading researcher behind the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine.
Prof Katalin Karikó, the senior vice-president for RNA protein replacement therapies at BioNTech in Germany, endured decades of scepticism over her work and was demoted and finally kicked out of her lab while developing the technology that made the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines possible.

UK government ministers have held private meetings with fossil fuel and biomass energy producers roughly nine times as often as they met companies involved in clean energy production, despite the increasing urgency of meeting the government’s climate targets.
Analysis by DeSmog, the environmental investigation group, of publicly available data shows that ministers from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) held 63 private meetings – with one company present, along with ministers and advisers – with fossil fuel and biomass energy producers between 22 July 2019 and 18 March 2021.

                    <span>Robert Jenrick’s madcap policy will hand shops over to developers motivated by profit, not community
The summer of 2021 may be remembered for Covid and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But another lasting and insidious change took place: the death of the high street. By approving the building of residential homes on ailing shopping streets, planning minister Robert Jenrick effectively allowed any shop, restaurant, cafe or business premise in England to become a house. Since almost everywhere houses make more money, this puts every high street under threat.
Although done in the name of creating “thriving town centres”, Jenrick’s policy will strip away the cohesion that still binds many communities together, urban as well as rural. The diversity of English towns and cities has long been protected by planners enforcing classes of use. Restaurants and shops could not simply become houses without planning permission. But as of last month, if any landlord thinks to profit by turning the use of one building into another, it will require no permission to do so. A building need only to have been vacant for three months (after Covid-19, this already applies to one in seven shops, and could easily be achieved by eviction). Hit by lockdown, online shopping and the end of rental holidays, high street shops are struggling to survive. They need time to recover, not Jenrick kicking them in the teeth and sending their landlords cheering to the bank.

A 100-year-old care home resident has issued a video plea for greater freedom, complaining that thousands of people can go to pop festivals but she is being prevented from seeing two of her children at her home in Yorkshire.
Frances Heaton said “human rights and equality are out of order altogether”, as 240,000 people signed a petition demanding a new law ending isolation for care home residents, with many saying care operators are still refusing to follow government advice on facilitating visits and are imposing their own stricter regimes. The petition is titled: “Please let me hug my family before it’s too late!”.

                    <span>As both the climate crisis and development intensify, Black cemeteries are now at a disproportionate risk of being lost, some before they have even been officially found 
On a cloudy weekend day in May, Jennifer Blanks took a trip to Canaan cemetery in Bryan, Texas. The six-acre site is the final resting place for a community of primarily Black farmers and veterans, with generations stretching back to the 1800s. Among the interred is Powell Harvey, the first Black man to serve as the Brazos county constable.
If Blanks hadn’t known this before visiting, though, she might have missed many of the graves completely.

                    <span>Late one night, I noticed the attic hatch was open. All the puzzle pieces fell into place – someone was in my apartment
In 1995, when I was 20, I moved to Enumclaw, a farming town in the US state of Washington, to be close to my brother and his family. I rented an apartment. My room was on the top floor but on my first night, lying in bed, I heard footsteps above me. Over the months, I started to notice things going missing. I would buy a six-pack of soda, drink one, come home from work and find only four left. It was the same with packets of soup and ramen noodles. I also noticed that doors I had left open were closed, or vice versa.
Mostly, I found it amusing – I assumed that my brother, who had a key, was coming over and eating my food. (Looking back, I should have known it wasn’t him because there would have been dirty dishes everywhere.)

                    <span>Poet Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan and standup comedian Nabil Abdul Rashid both came of age in the early 2000s, as Britain’s Muslim communities were feeling the backlash from 9/11. In conversation with Nosheen Iqbal, they look back at the past two decades and ahead to what the future holds for Britain’s Muslims


The 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that we have been reflecting on in Today in Focus had a particular effect on Britain’s Muslim communities. For many, the shock and outrage they felt was quickly followed by fear of reprisals against them. What followed was a relentless demonisation in some parts of the media, abuse in the streets, and legal measures such as control orders and the government’s Prevent anti-radicalisation programme that appeared to target their communities. 
 Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan was raised in Leeds in the 1990s as a Muslim, the eldest child of second generation British Pakistani parents. She describes striving to fit in at school and do all that was asked of her, eventually winning a place at Cambridge University and going on to become a successful poet. But she tells Nosheen Iqbal of her realisation that nothing she did could insulate her from subtle – and overt – Islamophobia. It was worst, she says, around the anniversary of 9/11 and in the immediate aftermath of other terrorist attacks.

A third of the female service members in the air force and space force say they’ve experienced sexual harassment, according to a new study. 
The AP reports:
The review, done by the Air Force inspector general concluded that minorities and women are underrepresented in leadership and officer positions, particularly at the senior levels, and get promoted less frequently. It echoed many of the findings of an initial review, released last December, which found that Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct.
The two reviews into racial, ethnic and gender disparities across the Air Force and Space Force broadly confirm that biases exist, but the data does not fully explain why. The studies also reflect broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism.

Joe Biden, striving to restore public confidence in his handling of the pandemic, announced new vaccination mandates on Thursday for 100 million workers, about two-thirds of the American labour force.
Channeling national frustration as the virus surges back, the US president adopted his sternest tone yet in reprimanding the tens of millions of Americans who are still not vaccinated against the coronavirus.

British musician Phil Collins says he can barely hold a drum stick because of deteriorating health that has also forced him to sit while singing during live performances.
The 70-year-old drummer and singer told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Thursday that he was frustrated at the challenges he faced. He underwent surgery on his back in 2009 and again in 2015 that affected his nerves, and he also has diabetes.

Scrapping the £1,000-a-year boost to universal credit next month will trigger mental illness and poorer health for thousands of people, and hit the sickest areas of the UK hardest, new research suggests.
Boris Johnson’s commitment to “levelling up” is thrown into doubt by the Health Foundation study, which comes as ministers are already facing criticism for a national insurance hike that will leave low-paid workers hundreds of pounds out of pocket. The ditching of the universal credit (UC) uplift, 19 months after it was brought in amid the pandemic, will be significantly worse for the poorest households.

Cristiano Ronaldo is good at football. That seems like a strange thing to write, but the certainty with which some have proclaimed his return to Manchester United a likely failure makes it a point worth revisiting. Of course there are reservations – will he press? Is Ole Gunnar Solskjær prepared to leave him out or take him off? – but these do not outweigh the realities. Over the past few seasons, United have struggled to score tap-ins, headers and in the biggest games, problems that perhaps the greatest ever goal machine might address, just as the addition of a monomaniacal winner might benefit a callow squad. It is already clear that Ronaldo’s arrival has inspired his new teammates, but his effect on opponents who know they are likely to be outmatched should not be underestimated. Starting with Newcastle on Saturday, those who have to actually play against Ronaldo will not be so dismissive. DH

The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said the law that went into effect last week after the supreme court refused to block it and bans almost all abortions in the state was one “all Americans should fear”.

A worsening wildfire that kept advancing through forest land and prompted the evacuation of nearly 1,000 residents has claimed the life of one firefighter, authorities in southern Spain said late on Thursday.
The blaze in a mountain range of the province of Málaga broke out late on Wednesday and grew, fanned by winds of up to 50km/h that constantly shifted directions. Nine hundred and forty people were evacuated near the resort town of Estepona and three other municipalities, the Andalusia regional authorities said.

It was easy to imagine the gravelly tones of the voiceover from those epic Hollywood movie trailers. Everything was quiet in the England camp. A little too quiet. Gareth Southgate smiled when the notion was put to him before Wednesday night’s World Cup qualifier against Poland in Warsaw.
There was a time, the England manager admitted, when he would worry if things were going smoothly to the extent that he would “go looking for problems”. He knows now it is simply better to enjoy the good periods, which these had been with five wins out of five on the road to Qatar 2022, because, well, this is England and one moment can wholly distort the narrative.

England narrowly scraped home in their T20 series decider against New Zealand at Taunton, dramatically reaching their target of 145 with one ball to spare. Captain Heather Knight – who had sat out the first two T20s with a hamstring injury – steered England to within touching distance of the victory with a calm 42 from 36 balls, but was caught at mid-off in the penultimate over with eight runs still needed.

                    <span>With theatre for an audience of one, a whirlwind set of Kevin Barry stories and sparky songs, the Irish festival is in fine form
Adapting to Covid-19 restrictions with ingenuity, Galway international arts festival has embraced hybrid forms of performance: live in theatres, streamed, filmed, recorded for headsets or available for a single audience member to encounter alone. In the case of Attic Projects’ arresting Volcano (★★★★☆), presented in four 45-minute parts, viewers have the intense experience of solo viewing in an individual booth, combined with glimpses of other audience members through glass screens. It can also be watched online in four episodes, like a television mini-series.
Cameras and screens are integral to this ambitious multimedia performance by dance-theatre artists Luke Murphy and Will Thompson, who play X and Y, cooped up in a dingy sitting room with no obvious exit. Think Sartre, Beckett or Enda Walsh, with more choreography. Memories of their lives prior to this mysterious co-dependency are played out in superbly inventive movement sequences – from tender duets to manic raves – triggered by a radio signal that becomes increasingly distorted. For a work created during lockdown, this is unexpectedly exhilarating: its sci-fi premise of a time-capsule sent into space being sufficiently expansive to encompass Covid-inspired questions of what is really of value in life, what is worth saving – and what remains when habitual bonds have loosened.

Four witnesses come forward to say they saw a pale, brown-haired man with a bloodied hand, outside, soon after the murder, crying and muttering incoherently to himself. After a 10-month investigation the police arrest and charge five black and mixed-race men, all of whom have alibis. A Killing in Tiger Bay (BBC Two) tells the story – in three hour-long episodes and granular, unsensationlist detail – of what happened, along with the subsequent convictions of three of them and the international outcry that saw those convictions eventually overturned.
As with most miscarriages of justice, the case is both unbelievable and only too believable. Unbelievable because, well, see above. And only too believable because of the way we know systemic bias and individual prejudice work and how they produce results that have a perverted logic of their own.

                    <span>State would be first in US to ban practice, allowing victims to sue perpetrators
California is expected to outlaw “stealthing”, becoming the first state to make it illegal to remove a condom without verbal consent during sex.
Legislators have sent a bill to the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, that would add the act to California’s civil definition of sexual battery. The bill would amend the civil code, allowing victims to sue perpetrators for damages, but would not change the criminal code to make it a crime that would send perpetrators to jail.

Australia’s cricketers partied long into the night on the outfield here two years ago. They had taken a 2-1 lead over England, retained the Ashes and, to empty stands and with beers in hand, gave a drawling rendition of True Blue by the folk singer John Williamson.
Tim Paine, their captain, looked to gee up his players before the subsequent fifth Test at the Oval, dubbing it their “Grand Final” in a nod to the other major codes back home. But what followed was the performance of a team that had experienced its moment a week earlier. England won, the series was drawn 2-2 and Cricket Australia’s fly-on-the-wall documentary did not get the final flourish its editors had hoped for.

Downing Street has come out in strong support of the embattled Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, after a backlash to the government’s decision to extend her time in office.
The formal announcement to extend her five-year term as Britain’s top police officer by two years, to 2024, is expected in days, multiple sources have told the Guardian.

                    <span>The man who shattered Djokovic’s Olympic dream could stop him winning a calendar-year grand slam at the US Open, too
Two more matches. Six more sets. Those are the only remaining obstacles separating Novak Djokovic from becoming the first male player to win the calendar-year grand slam since Rod Laver in 1969 while also winning his 21st grand slam title, breaking his tie with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But as he rounds on his final hurdles, standing before him are the most difficult tasks to come. On Friday he will face the surging Alexander Zverev in the semi-final, and if he wins possibly Daniil Medvedev, the second seed, in the final.
Over the course of the summer, Zverev, the fourth seed, has come to represent the biggest source of friction in Djokovic’s historic season. Just over a month ago, the Serb was seemingly powering towards his elusive Olympic gold medal and he led Zverev 6-1, 3-2 in the semi-final with a break of serve. But then, in a flash, it was gone. He lost 10 of the next 11 games and after starting the match with a 22-match winning streak, he lost three matches, two each in singles and one in mixed doubles, within 24 hours, as well as pulling out of the mixed doubles bronze-medal match. He left Tokyo exhausted. “I played great, great tennis. Then unfortunately [my] game fell apart. It happens,” he said on Wednesday about the loss against Zverev, after his four-set win over Matteo Berrettini.

The Scottish parliament has approved plans for vaccine passports, which will come into force from 1 October for those seeking entry to nightclubs and large-scale events, despite fierce criticism from opposition parties and business leaders.
The SNP government’s proposal was passed with support from the Scottish Greens, who signed a cooperation deal with the Scottish government last month. It was despite Green co-leader Patrick Harvie previously warning that vaccine passports posed “a real danger of generational injustice”.

Several newspapers have carried reports suggesting that the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, a charitable foundation that funds UK citizens to study abroad, had changed its name and removed pictures of Churchill in an attempt to “woke-wash” his memory.

The battle for the post-pandemic holiday skies has taken a new twist, as easyJet launched a £1.2bn fundraiser while announcing it had fended off a takeover bid – widely assumed to be from rival Wizz Air.
EasyJet, the dominant airline at Gatwick , said the “unsolicited approach” from an unnamed bidder was unanimously rejected by its board. Wizz declined to comment but the offer of an “all-share transaction” pointed to the Hungary-based carrier, which has targeted rapid expansion across Europe with a beady eye on England’s leisure market, which London’s second airport serves.

Godley is well known for her comedy voiceovers of high-profile figures, including spoofs of the first minister’s Covid briefings during the pandemic. She is also a standup and has appeared on Have I Got News for You.

                    <span>Wizz Air’s offer was rejected, of course, but £1.2bn rights issue hardly put fizz back into shares
The pandemic has transformed the airline industry in unexpected ways: Wizz Air, whose shares have recovered all the altitude lost in the early months of lockdown, is now bigger in stock market terms than easyJet. The latter’s shares are stuck at half their old level and £3.25bn valuation now compares with £5bn for Wizz.
The position is quite a comedown for easyJet, and Wizz’s cheeky takeover bid, one suspects, will have come as a blow to the corporate ego. It had to be rejected, of course, because it would have been an act of desperation to contemplate an all-share deal on “low premium” terms at today’s valuation. Life is tough for easyJet, a UK-skewed operator more exposed than most to UK travel restrictions and the absurd price of PRC tests, but this is not a moment to give up.

Ministers have piled pressure on the vaccines watchdog to approve a large-scale programme of Covid booster injections in time for winter, as the number of people in hospital with the virus exceeded 8,000 for the first time since March.
On Thursday the UK’s medicines regulator granted emergency approval for the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to be used as third shots to tackle potentially waning immunity, also putting pressure on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to approve a new jab programme.

                    <span>Report calls for greater regulation at facilities for those with learning disabilities after three deaths at Norfolk site
Private hospitals receiving millions to care for adults with learning disabilities and autism should face greater regulation, a report has warned, as a mother whose son was among three people to die at a facility in Norfolk said his death was a “scandal”.
The failures at Cawston Park Hospital near Aylsham should prompt a review to prevent further “lethal outcomes” at similar sites, the report, commissioned by Norfolk Safeguarding Adults Board (NSAB), concluded. It suggested that such facilities should “cease to receive public money”.

Austrian police have discovered the body of an 89-year-old woman who died more than a year ago and was mummified in the cellar by her son who wanted to continue receiving her benefits.
In a statement, police said the woman, who is believed to have suffered from dementia, had died in June last year.

                    <span>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is taking a high-risk gamble in which the people of Northern Ireland are likely to pay a heavy price
The threat by the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, to collapse the Stormont executive unless the Northern Ireland protocol is scrapped risks creating a crisis for electoral gain. Some in the DUP may think that bringing down the power-sharing executive works to their advantage. But it’s a high-risk gamble in which the public would almost certainly pay a heavy price.
Before Covid struck, the region had spent three years without an assembly, leaving it with the longest NHS waiting lists in the UK. If the day-to-day running of Northern Ireland passed to the civil service, it is hard to see how decisions in the public interest to pull out of the pandemic could be made by unelected officials. Brexit was the catalyst for rioting in Northern Ireland earlier this year. Tensions are best defused in a democratic arena, not on the streets.

                    <span>New carbon capture technology should be welcomed. But weaning the world off coal, oil and gas is what matters most
The switching on of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage plant, in Iceland, is a glimmer of hope in a bleak climate landscape. The amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by this new machine will be tiny: 4,000 tonnes a year, which is equivalent to that produced by 870 cars. Still, the project brings a step closer the possibility that significant amounts of carbon dioxide could, one day, be removed from the atmosphere.
The significant risks that such technological developments carry must be addressed head-on. The danger is that they are a displacement activity from the massive and necessary task of reducing and then eliminating emissions (with any residual emissions offset or, if carbon capture technologies are scaled up, removed). This distraction need not be deliberate, although fossil fuel producers have consistently undermined climate action by promoting the idea that technological solutions will eventually make calls to decarbonise obsolete.

The British Council, the British government’s cultural arm and a key instrument of British soft power, is to close 20 offices across the globe as part of a restructuring programme made necessary by cuts to the aid budget and shortfall of income.
The British Council confirmed that “due to the impact of Covid on our commercial income, which we previously used to subsidise our offices overseas, and an overall decline in our funding compared to pre-Covid, we face a significant funding gap”. It added that as a result, it “will need to look at delivering our work in 20 countries remotely or digitally”.

At some point during lockdown, perhaps in week four or week eight – I’m not entirely sure as I’ve lost all sense of time – I started doing a 1,000-piece puzzle each day. In the morning, I’d clear the dining room table, turn the TV on to something inane and get to work sorting through a mosaic of cardboard pieces until well into the evening.
I’ve always enjoyed puzzles: in preschool, I’d choose puzzles over dolls or the jungle gym, and there have been more than one New Year’s Eve spent with loved ones, tucking into bottles of wine and a puzzle as fireworks crackled overhead. But since the pandemic, I’ve completed more puzzles than ever before. And I’m not alone. In households across the country, in locked-down regions, Australians are sat on the floor or at a table, rummaging through puzzle pieces, attempting to make something whole out of something disordered.

Afghanistan’s population of 38 million people risks being plunged into near-universal poverty faced with a “catastrophic deterioration” of the country’s heavily aid-dependent economy, according to a warning issued by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The study, which examines a series of scenarios facing the already impoverished country under the Taliban’s new hardline rule, suggests a worst-case scenario where as many as 97% of Afghans would sink below the poverty line by next year – a staggering increase of 25%.

He does it again, he pulls it off. The figure David Cameron once called the “greased piglet” has slipped from the grasp of his angry party and the Tory press, all incensed by this new levy. Boris Johnson trounced them, a mere five rebels. Despite featuring only 21st in popularity in ConservativeHome’s poll of party members, he defies them all.
As long as enough of the people can be fooled enough of the time, he will go on getting away with downright fraudulent policies. Breaking promises is a peccadillo compared with a social care policy that is a sham from top to toe. But, for now, his policy flies in a miasma of aspirational promises, while facts are what he says they are.

A spate of violent attacks on Afghan journalists by the Taliban is prompting growing alarm over the freedom of the country’s media, with one senior journalist declaring that “press freedom has ended”.
As images and testimony circulated internationally of the arrest and brutal flogging of two reporters who were detained covering a women’s rights demonstration in Kabul on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists raised concern over the recent string of attacks.

                    <span>War of words takes place between former Fleetwood Mac couple, with Buckingham accusing the band of dishonouring its legacy
One of the bitterest feuds in pop music rolls on, after Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks – once a couple whose breakup powered the classic album Rumours – have strongly disputed Buckingham’s departure from the band.
In 2018, it was announced that Buckingham would not be appearing on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac tour. Buckingham sued the band later that year, saying that he was “suddenly cut off” after a dispute over being able to postpone the tour to play solo dates.

Ikea is poised to buy Topshop’s former flagship store on London’s Oxford Street, once the jewel in Sir Philip Green’s retail empire, for an estimated £385m, creating a new London home for the Swedish furniture brand.
The deal to buy the long leasehold on the building, which includes the now-vacant 100,000 sq ft Topshop outlet as well as a Nike Town store and a shop for footwear brand Vans, is expected to complete the sell off of the assets of Green’s Arcadia Group empire which collapsed into administration in November last year.

                    <span>The Conservative government is attempting to rig elections in the party’s favour with the proposed changes, say readers
The elections bill has been slipped into parliament while the nation is obsessed with care funding and the increase in national insurance contributions (Tory MPs call it reform, but the elections bill looks more like a heist, 8 September). Apart from a few Guardian articles, it has been virtually ignored by the media, the Labour party, the BBC and the rightwing press.
Yet an assault on democracy is much more important. Removing the independence of the Electoral Commission is a huge change to our constitution. Putting Michael Gove in charge of the rules for elections is mind-boggling. Introducing mandatory voter ID is unnecessary as there is no problem to fix. Changes to campaigning are aimed at constraining the Labour party and freeing up Conservative donors.

I have some sympathy with my fellow pensioners saying that they have already paid their whack. But there are two major caveats to that (Letters, 6 September).
First, contributions to the state pension in the 1960s and 70s were based on people living to their late 60s or 70s, not over 80, and didn’t cover social care – so we have not really paid what we are now drawing. And even my workplace pension was calculated on my living to just about 80, not considerably longer.

World Athletics president warns of anger across Olympic sports

Fifa’s radical plans to stage a biennial World Cup came under attack hours after they were officially unveiled on Thursday – with the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, warning of growing anger across Olympic sports and Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, saying the proposals could “kill football”.
The Premier League joined 36 other European leagues in signing a statement stating they were “firmly and unanimously opposed” to Fifa’s proposals for a new international calendar which would see a major international tournament every summer, with the World Cup and Euros in alternate years.

The company, which was bought out by Coca-Cola in 2018, said that from 1 October all store team members would receive increases of at least 45p an hour, raising minimum pay to £9.36 an hour, up from £8.91, thenational minimum wage for those aged over 23. Top rates of pay, depending on location and experience, will increase from £10.64 an hour to £11.29.

                    <span>Drink, depression, homelessness and football injuries: the road to the director’s first feature, Sweetheart, has been difficult. She even dumped one project when her feelings about her gender identity changed
Marley Morrison has written and directed a knockout first feature – the witty, spiky queer romance Sweetheart – but when she rocks up to the back terrace of a London cafe, her appearance doesn’t exactly scream “film-maker”. The impish 35-year-old looks more like the coolest cartoon character you ever saw: the love child of Popeye and Tank Girl. Bleached hair peeks out from beneath her pink Barbour cap; shorts and T-shirt leave her intricately cross-hatched tattoos on display. “My partner’s a tattoo artist,” she explains as she sits down, “so I’m a sketch book.” On one arm is Marlene Dietrich; on the other, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are snuggled up together in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. On her right calf is the Disney warrior Mulan, who in ancient China came to her father’s rescue by dressing as a boy. Hold that thought.
Morrison has glowering eyes, and a Lena Dunham-esque surliness that disappears the second she starts talking about the astonishing reception Sweetheart has had this year on the festival circuit. “I wasn’t expecting this,” she says, sounding dazed. “I just hoped it might resonate with a few people.” The picture won the audience award at the Glasgow film festival, as well as being named best first feature at the Inside Out festival in Toronto, while its star, the miraculous newcomer Nell Barlow, took home the best performance prize at Outfest in Los Angeles. Morrison herself is suddenly in demand: she has just made an ad campaign for Microsoft and will direct episodes of a new ITV2 teen drama before she moves on to her next film.

Around 1980 this book was in the window of every bookshop. I got one for Christmas when I was 13 or 14. It was my father’s selection. I remember thinking: “What the fuck is this?” But once I started reading, I could not stop and I became obsessed with it. It’s about human behaviour. I was just discovering my sexuality and how we relate to other human beings and this book blew my mind. I remember a section about “displacement reactions”, something you do when you’re nervous or uncomfortable and you’re trying to divert the conversation elsewhere. I used to do this strange thing with my legs. I’d shake them and rub my thighs. It was very odd and friends used to comment, but through understanding it I was able to curtail my unconscious behaviour. The book changed the way I looked at everybody and I’ve been fascinated by people-watching ever since. Plus there were pictures of genitalia and stuff about sex [laughs], which to this day I don’t think has ever been mentioned in my house. So as a teenager it was mesmerising.

Whether he is what Manchester United need is a different question, but for the club and the Premier League it is an incredible signing. Thirty-six years old, still breaking records, still generating the headlines, still demanding the shirt numbers.

It is almost exactly 10 years since Salvator Mundi was unveiled, this “lost Leonardo” instantly triggering astonishment around the world. Since those giddy days, the work has had a turbulent time. As well as becoming the most expensive painting in history, going for $450m (£326m) at auction, Salvator Mundi was denounced by many as a fake and subsequently vanished from view. The painting is now the subject of The Lost Leonardo, a documentary by Andreas Koefoed that opens in cinemas this week.
“I would be surprised,” says Luke Syson, “if I went to see this documentary.” Syson is the curator who, back in 2011, first displayed The Saviour of the World, as its title translates, at the National Gallery’s Leonardo da Vinci blockbuster. Syson is probably making a wise choice. He’s in the film and the way he clams up mid-interview makes him look like the archetypal embarrassed expert caught out on screen.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Hoarding of vaccines by wealthy western nations will result in thousands of needless deaths from Covid-19 in the world’s poorest countries every month unless urgent steps are taken to distribute jabs more fairly, Gordon Brown has said.
In an article for the Guardian, the former Labour prime minister called on the G7 rich industrial nations to hold an emergency summit in order to prevent a billion unused doses being amassed by the end of the year.

                    <span>Covid vaccine production is now so high that millions of doses risk going to waste while poorer countries struggle for supplies

Gordon Brown was UK prime minister between 2007 and 2010

Soon, the ten-billionth Covid vaccine will roll off the production lines. By January, according to a recent report from the data research agency Airfinity, a tipping point will be reached when there will be enough vaccine doses for every adult on every continent. By June the number of doses will reach 27bn, enough to fully immunise the world’s population twice over.
But despite this manufacturing triumph, we are losing badly in the arms race to actually inject every adult in every country. Next summer, on current trends, more than half the world will remain unvaccinated. We simply aren’t getting doses out to the people who need them.

                    <span>Activists say almost 2,000 people on waiting list for place to stay owing to lack of affordable accommodation
Scotland-based climate campaigners have condemned “the most exclusionary Cop ever”, as they reveal a waiting list of nearly 2,000 delegates and activists who were still seeking affordable accommodation for November’s summit in Glasgow.
The Cop26 Homestay Network, which was launched in May, and is described by organisers as a “non-corporate Airbnb”, aims to match local hosts from across the central belt of Scotland with visiting climate change campaigners, scientists and non-governmental organisations.

Before they can access public or financial services, EU nationals have to prove that they have been granted either settled or pre-settled status by the Home Office.

                    <span>Our sector will receive just £2.9bn over three years. That will do nothing to mitigate decades of underfunding

Mike Padgham is the managing director of Saint Cecilia’s Care Group

Watching the government’s announcement on Tuesday of a new health and social care levy in England, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of deja vu: it was the type of damp squib moment that those of us who work in the care sector have become used to over the past 30 years.
The rise in national insurance will raise £36bn in the coming three years – but the bulk of that is going to tackle shortfalls in the NHS. Only around £5.4bn is likely to find its way to social care – a term that refers to the providers of care for elderly and disabled people. Factor in that £2.5bn of that will be needed to fund the new cap on care costs, which should stop people from paying over the odds, and that just leaves £2.9bn.

Our criteria here is films featuring actual mobsters and the organised crime milieu – as opposed to hitmen, heists or bank robbers. Stefano Sollima’s punchy neo-noir, set in 2011, fits the bill with its imbroglio of crime families, political corruption and Rome real estate. Financed by Netflix, this is essentially a feature-length pilot for the addictive Suburra: Blood on Rome prequel series.

                    <span>A cross between a Disneyland castle and a chilling concrete block, the Humboldt Forum is set to teach visitors about Germany’s colonial era. But is the past being examined – or exalted?
A museum gift shop has never been such an ideological battleground. At one end of the store in Berlin’s new Humboldt Forum is a display of souvenirs adorned with the gilded silhouette of the Stadtschloss, the city’s former royal palace, which was bombed to pieces in the second world war. Racks of silk scarves and Christmas baubles hang above rows of candles in regal colours, emblazoned with an image of the stately Prussian pile.
At the other end of the shop is a rival range of merchandise, themed around the former East German parliament and leisure centre, the Palast der Republik, which was triumphantly built on top of the ruins of the palace in the 1970s. With its sharp white marble walls, bronze-mirrored windows and space-age chandeliers, it was designed to showcase the wonders of socialism. You can buy keyrings and enamel mugs in a retro Soviet style, as well as a model kit of the building in Formo, the East German version of Lego, for €250.

“Like climbing an infinite stairway, one step at a time.” That is how Pavel Kolesnikov describes working on JS Bach’s Goldberg Variations, one of the outstanding releases of last year. On Friday 10 September, he will perform them at the penultimate night of the Proms.
“I’ve never had the chance to dedicate so much quality time to a piece before,” he says when we meet in a tiny cafe in central London. The city has been home since the Siberia-born Kolesnikov, now in his early 30s, came to study at the Royal College of Music. He had grown up listening to recordings of the Goldbergs by Glenn Gould and Rosalyn Tureck, but had never considered performing them himself – “I did not feel I had anything to add”.

A little piece of my soul was left in Polignano a Mare, a beautiful slice of real Italian life in Puglia. Pretty houses perching on clifftops overlooking emerald seas, a labyrinth of streets leading to a stunning old town, delectable gelato and a buzzy atmosphere as locals promenade and music plays, all combine to create a real gem. The contemporary art museum is worth a gander. It is the wandering, however, getting lost in delightful white-washed streets, stumbling across the poetry written on doorways and stairs, finding a clifftop bar beloved by locals, which is the key to enjoying this romantic town.

                    <span>A humanitarian crisis looms unless Americans and Europeans continue to fund the projects keeping Afghans from oblivion
Leaving is the easy bit. It’s the looking back that hurts. There was – as Joe Biden pointed out when announcing America’s defeat at the hands of the Taliban on 31 August – nothing “low-grade or low-risk or low-cost” about a 20-year deployment that cost the United States more than $1tn and thousands of service personnel their lives, their limbs or their peace of mind. But it is disingenuous to claim, as the president also did, that closing the door on Afghanistan will miraculously free the US to deal with more pressing concerns such as China and Russia.
A humanitarian crisis looms over the country, caused in part by the abrupt halting of international aid after the Taliban takeover. Even now, despite the US retreat and the announcement by the regime, on Tuesday, of an interim cabinet that gives scant representation to the country’s different ethnic groups and none at all to women or Shias, Afghanistan can’t be forgotten. Its people’s needs, and the country’s capacity to send out ripples of instability, will continue to demand attention.

                    <span>After years in US soaps, he landed the part of Armond in The White Lotus – a ‘dreamy’ role that involved defecating in a suitcase. He discusses making it in middle age, coming out to his parents and losing his front teeth
It was in the middle of the pandemic that Murray Bartlett began wondering if he would ever work as an actor again. “I thought: ‘What do I do? Do I teach drama?’” He and his partner had left New York for Provincetown, Massachusetts, not long before, unsure of whether the move would jeopardise his potential roles. The virus added another note of uncertainty.
In the grip of this career crisis came the call that led to the most compelling role he has had. If any television scene can sum up the mood of our times, it is Bartlett, as the harried luxury hotel manager Armond, pooing in the suitcase of an obscenely privileged, obnoxious guest. Armond begins the six‑part series, The White Lotus, determined to do his job well, to please all the necessary people. But, as catastrophe spreads, his eyes glitter, his mood changes and it is clear propriety is about to be set aside. His descent from assured, capable, sober hotelier to rogue manager, high on drugs stolen from two teenage guests, set on sabotaging a deeply unpleasant honeymooner, is spectacular – and probably the TV moment of the year.

                    <span>The blunt-edged, security-oriented approach allows little space to tackle the root causes of violence and find resolution

Sophie Haspeslagh is an assistant professor in political science at the American University in Cairo

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States spearheaded an international campaign to contain the threat from militant groups, like al-Qaida, by encouraging states to blacklist “terrorist” groups. Perhaps the most significant part of this effort was the passing of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (UNSC 1373), on 28 September 2001. Twenty years later, the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan is just one example of how this heavy-handed anti-terror strategy failed.
The global blacklisting regime has not only failed to contain the Taliban but it has also made it harder to end wars across the globe. Resolution 1373 encouraged member states to set up their own blacklists to sanction the support of terror groups. But in the absence of a UN definition of what actually constitutes “terrorism”, the resolution led to states identifying suspects in light of their own national interests. Beyond al-Qaida and the Taliban, armed groups as diverse as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the Communist Party of Nepal, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party in Turkey, the Communist Party of the Philippines and Hamas in Palestine were listed as terrorists.

                    <span>Climate policies commit us to a calamitous 2.9C of global heating, but catastrophic changes can occur at even 1.5C or 2C
If there’s one thing we know about climate breakdown, it’s that it will not be linear, smooth or gradual. Just as one continental plate might push beneath another in sudden fits and starts, causing periodic earthquakes and tsunamis, our atmospheric systems will absorb the stress for a while, then suddenly shift. Yet, everywhere, the programmes designed to avert it are linear, smooth and gradual.
Current plans to avoid catastrophe would work in a simple system like a washbasin, in which you can close the tap until the inflow is less than the outflow. But they are less likely to work in complex systems, such as the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. Complex systems seek equilibrium. When they are pushed too far out of one equilibrium state, they can flip suddenly into another. A common property of complex systems is that it’s much easier to push them past a tipping point than to push them back. Once a transition has happened, it cannot realistically be reversed.

The board wobbles again. I drop back into a kneeling position and shake my head ruefully at Adam, the instructor. Even standing up from the ground on dry land is quite a business these days; I am not at all confident I can do it on the water. Paddleboarding (SUP) is one of the world’s fastest growing water sports and so – perhaps unwisely – I’ve decided to give it a go.

                    <span>I first encountered TB Joshua as a teenager, when his preaching captivated my evangelical Christian community in Hampshire. Many of my friends became his ardent disciples and followed him to Lagos. How did he have such a hold over people?

On the second day of TB Joshua’s funeral in Lagos, his disciples took to the stage. A microphone was passed around as more than 60 disciples introduced themselves by name and nationality. They came from 18 different countries, among them Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, the US and the UK. Some seemed barely out of their teens; others were in late middle age, having spent decades serving Joshua, the millionaire Nigerian pastor and self-proclaimed prophet being laid to rest. A senior Nigerian disciple, recently promoted to prophetess, began her tribute. “How to describe someone so indescribable?” she said. “How to define someone so indefinable? Human and divine?”
Joshua died on 5 June 2021, a few days before his 58th birthday. The news spread on social media, before the Synagogue, Church of All Nations, known as Scoan, made an official announcement. “God has taken His servant Prophet TB Joshua home,” the statement read, “as it should be by divine will.” Over a month later, his funeral under way, there had been no mention of a cause of death.

                    <span>Few terrorist organisations survive for more than a few years. Al-Qaida was different. Jason Burke, who has spent much of his career reporting on the group, and former member Aimen Dean reflect on how it was able to carry out the September 11 attacks more than a decade after it was formed – and its struggle to survive the fallout from its ‘catastrophic success’
To many people, the sight of two airliners hitting the twin towers in New York prompted an immediate question: who did this? To Jason Burke and Aimen Dean, the answer was obvious. Burke had already reported extensively on the terrorist network, travelling in Afghanistan as he sought to understand its motivations and command structure. Dean knew firsthand what Osama bin Laden’s agenda was: he had met the terrorist leader twice, and trained as a bombmaker in Afghanistan before turning and becoming a spy for MI6.
In this episode, the second of three examining the reverberations of 9/11 20 years on, Michael Safi asks Burke and Dean how al-Qaida developed the capacity for an attack that would change the course of history. And they reflect on the fallout from Bin Laden’s ‘catastrophic success’, controversial even to his peers, and how the organisation survived and adapted to remain a threat after two decades.

 1.56am BST 
Next up, it’s Novak Djokovic and Matteo Berrettini for the final men’s semi-final berth. It’s a rematch of their French Open quarter-final and Wimbledon final meetings from earlier this summer, both won by the world No 1 in four sets. Here’s what Djokovic said about his Italian foe on Monday following his fourth-round win over Jenson Brooksby:
Hammer of tennis. Next to Del Potro, probably the hardest hitter of serve and forehand. He’s got the lethal-serve-plus-one game. He’s already established as a top player. Without a doubt, he played a couple of I think semi-finals here couple years ago, finals in Wimbledon. That was a tough four-setter.
Look, if he serves well, which is his biggest weapon, he’s tough. He’s tough on any surface to play against. I’ve had some really close matches with him in French Open and Wimbledon recently.
 1.50am BST 
“I trusted my serve, but now I’m going to trust it even more,” Sakkari says. And why not? The 26-year-old from Greece never faced a break point and won all but eight of the 49 points on her serve. That includes a remarkable 24 of 26 first-serve points won, a torrid 92% clip.
After having never made it past the fourth round in 20 appearances at major tournaments, Sakkari reached the French Open semis in June and has matched that showing here in Queens.

A former nurse who co-founded and once ran the cult-like Nxivm group, where prosecutors say women were brainwashed, branded like animals and coerced into sex, was sentenced to 42 months in prison. 
Nancy Salzman, the former president and co-founder of Nxivm, must also pay a $150,000 fine, US district judge Nicholas Garaufis said on Wednesday. She has agreed to forfeit more than $500,000 in cash, several properties and a Steinway grand piano.

International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said the North Korean national Olympic body would also now forfeit money it was due from previous Olympics. The unspecified amount – potentially millions of dollars – had been withheld because of international sanctions.

The meltdowns in Japan caused by a giant tsunami released more radiation into the atmosphere than any nuclear disaster except Chernobyl in 1986.

The death toll in Louisiana from Hurricane Ida has risen to 26 with the additional 11 deaths all occurring in the city of New Orleans, officials said on Wednesday, as the region continues to grapple with the fallout from the storm and lingering power outages that have left thousands in the dark.
The rising death toll in Louisiana comes as another storm threatens the the US south-east. Tropical Storm Mindy formed Wednesday in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, prompting forecasters to issue a tropical storm warning for part of the Florida panhandle.

                    <span>Arrival, co-created with the local community, will take audiences on a journey around the historic industrial area set to welcome City Hall 
When the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, completes the relocation of City Hall HQ from Southwark to the Crystal building in the historic Royal Docks, he will become the latest to settle in an area synonymous with arrivals. This autumn, a new promenade theatre show is set to consider other inhabitants – from the past, present and future – of a region undergoing a major regeneration.
The production, named Arrival, is being co-created by the local community, working with directors Jon Bausor and Matthew Dunster. “It’s no accident that the mayor wants to align himself with this area – it’s an area of innovation,” says Dunster. Victoria Dock, which opened in 1855, was a technological feat itself and the show will consider the role of the docks in trade and industry through the products that have arrived there as well as the people.

In an interview before next week’s TUC conference, the trade union umbrella group’s general secretary said there was now a “chasm” between low-paid workers and the better-off.

The Frankie effect should ensure that Free Wind sets off as favourite for the Group Two Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster on Thursday, the feature event as a big crowd returns to Town Moor for ladies’ day at the St Leger meeting.
John Gosden’s filly is priced up at around 9-4 to follow up her win in a Group Three at Deauville last month, but she is just one of three progressive three-year-old fillies in the field and certainly not as far ahead of them as her odds might suggest.

In a scathing open letter to Boris Johnson, first reported in the Daily Mail, the panel of influential individuals said that after “decades of equivocation and inertia”, the Met must be held accountable for its failings and Dick should not be handed the two-year extension to her term in office, which she was offered on Wednesday.

Beyond the visual thrills and powerful ballads, this adaptation brings an unexpected depth to the relationship between two tortured sisters 

This musical extravaganza about estranged sisters, an icy kingdom and unharnessed supernatural powers arrives in the West End from Broadway as part of a plan to stage five Frozens around the world this year. As canny as that seems commercially, a mega-successful animation does not always translate into a stage hit, even with Disney money thrown at it.
The 2013 film was met with acclaim, Oscars and delirium. Does this adaptation live up to that hefty legacy? Yes, and perhaps it even exceeds it. This is a show every bit as magical as the animation, packed with visual thrills and gorgeous choreography (by Rob Ashford) alongside signature ballads that gain greater power in their live incarnation. It is big on spectacle yet never loses control with special effects that yield some dazzling coups de theatre.

                    <span>People who lived – and even some of those who died – in Grenfell Tower have their voices heard in this singular documentary featuring footage shot before the fire
Grenfell: The Untold Story (Channel 4) is a beautiful film about the most awful of subjects. The simple tragedy of 70 people dying in one night – two more thereafter – when a tower block caught fire is terrible enough. The story of how and why it became the inferno it did, capable of unleashing such devastation, is presented as one of such moral failure and ugliness that if you hadn’t witnessed it unfold you would half-believe it was a fable for our times.
But we did witness it. First in the headlines and the contemporary footage of the fire itself as – in the early hours of the morning of 14 June 2017 – it spread rapidly from a fridge in a fourth-floor flat up the outside of the recently refurbished 1970s block in west London. Then in the reports of the deaths – including 18 children, a quarter of all the young people who had lived in the tower. And then in the Grenfell inquiry, which confirmed that it was the exterior cladding, changed from the proposed type to a cheaper, more flammable kind that enabled the rapid spread of the flames and the production of toxic gases (which spread easily due to a lack of fire doors fit for purpose) – without which, one must presume, the death toll would have been lower.

Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: “The president’s objective is what any president’s objective is – to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values. And so yes, that was an ask that was made.”

                    <span>With 72 minutes on the clock, the thought occurred that Harry Kane had not had much service. It was partly because the England captain was trying to provide it for others, dropping back from his centre-forward’s position to pick his passes.
It was time for Kane to take matters into his own hands. The ball was worked to him at the top of the midfield and, with little on and Poland players backing off rather too respectfully, Kane unloaded with murderous intent.

As she basked in the glory of her unexpected run, Raducanu revealed that such were her realistic expectations, her flights were booked for the end of the qualifying tournament. She has overstayed her original plans by a week and a half.

A 1-0 home defeat dealt by Claudia Zornoza’s first-half strike was enough for the newcomers, Real Madrid, following a first-leg 1-1 away draw for City in Spain. They have now been knocked out by Spanish opposition for the fourth season in a row.

                    <span>Forty years on from John Carpenter’s classic slasher film, David Gordon Green’s latest reanimation of the title is functional but enjoyable
It’s Halloween 2018 in Haddonfield, Illinois, and the time-honoured festivities are in full swing. At the start of the second episode of the revived franchise there’s already a body impaled on railings, and a cop (Will Patton) gushing blood on the ground. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) – horror cinema’s original Final Girl, now Final Grandmother – is being rushed to hospital, and her house is in flames. But indestructible killer Michael Myers has decided to make a night of it, and is out there armed with a firefighter’s axe, axing firefighters.
Forty years after John Carpenter made the defining slasher movie, director David Gordon Green has made a creditable stab, as it were, at reanimating the title. Green is an occasional indie auteur (George Washington, Prince Avalanche) who leads a double life as a mainstream stalwart, and showed in his 2018 Halloween reboot that he’s more than competent at straight genre thrills. Writing again with Danny McBride, here joined by Scott Teems, Green offers a functional but enjoyably efficient follow-up. It kicks in only minutes after the events of the previous episode, and pretty much follows a straight line, apart from brief flashbacks to 1978, with even a passable Donald Pleasence lookalike on hand to lend authenticity.

The apparent attack, which was alleged to have taken place in the central Madrid neighbourhood of Malasaña on Sunday afternoon, shocked Spain and came amid a rise in hate crimes – and just two months after a gay man was beaten to death in the northern city of A Coruña.

This is where the fairytale was meant to end: opposite the in-form Belinda Bencic, the newly minted Olympic gold medallist who had lost only once in her last 14 matches, whose class and experience would surely be too much for a teenager ranked 150th in the world.

News:  ‘Mind-bending’ Piranesi wins Women’s prize
This year’s Women’s prize produced a notably strong shortlist, led by Brit Bennett’s landmark saga of racism and family in the US, The Vanishing Half; along with Patricia Lockwood’s hilariously barbed satire of internet domination, No One is Talking About This, and Yaa Gyasi’s thoughtful exploration of science, faith and generational trauma, Transcendent Kingdom. It also spotlit Claire Fuller’s quietly brilliant portrayal of English outsiders, Unsettled Ground, and a searing Barbadian debut, How the One-Armed Sister Sweeps Her House by Cherie Jones.
But it’s a delight to see the award go to Susanna Clarke’s triumphantly unusual second novel Piranesi, which begins as the diary of a man trapped in a vast mysterious mansion, in which an ocean rises and falls. He is dreamily content there, with birds, statues and his own scribblings for company, believing himself alone in the world except for visits from a well-dressed Other, who brings vitamin pills and appears to be studying him.

Comment: Piranesi is a triumphantly unusual winner
Susanna Clarke, who published her debut novel Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell 17 years ago and then was struck down with chronic illness, has won the Women’s prize for fiction for her second, Piranesi.
Narrated by its eponymous hero as he explores the endless halls of a house that imprisons an ocean, Piranesi is “a truly original, unexpected flight of fancy which melds genres and challenges preconceptions about what books should be,” according to the Women’s prize chair of judges, Booker-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo.

                    <span>The 1.25-point rise in tax on dividend income will hit sole traders and the self-employed    
The lower-profile element in the government’s tax hike to raise cash for health and social care was the 1.25% percentage point increase in tax on dividend income. It didn’t generate the same attention as the core revenue-raising “social care levy” on national insurance contributions because, first, the sums are smaller, and, second, because wealthy individuals enjoying dividend income from vast share portfolios are viewed as fair game.
But therein lies the political cynicism in the measure. While some fortunate folk do indeed fit the dividend-happy caricature, not many will be touched by this measure. Those at the top of the bracket long ago moved their holdings offshore. And the comfortable class of private investor knows the first rule of the game: utilise your annual tax-free Isa allowance (currently £20,000).

                    <span>Labour fail to make hay over PM’s trashing of national insurance and pensions pledges
There can be benefits to being a serial liar. While politicians with a reputation for honesty can find their careers ended by one broken promise, those, like Boris Johnson, for whom the truth is by and large an unknown country, can skate by unscathed. Simply because no one expects him to keep his word. His relationships with family, friends and voters are entirely transactional. They get to hear what they want: he gets to bend reality to whatever serves him best at any given time.
One of the great illusions is that so many mistake his constant shape-shifting as a sign of self-confidence. It isn’t. It’s a sign of someone with no self-worth. Someone who can’t face reality. Though that has never held Boris back.

Raducanu just the fourth qualifier to reach a major semi

For all that Emma Raducanu has achieved and how far she has come over only a few fleeting weeks as a full-time professional, one of the opportunities she was still waiting for was the chance to battle against a top player. Until she stepped on to Arthur Ashe Stadium, she had never faced a top-40 opponent or tested her strengths against the best.
When the time came against one of the most in-form players on the tour, the Olympic champion, she surveyed the threat across the net and simply stepped up another level.

Michael Schumacher’s wife Corinna has revealed the former seven-times world F1 champion is still battling to recover from brain injury caused by a skiing accident but remains “here but different”, in a Netflix documentary to be aired next week.
Updates on the former Ferrari driver’s health have been infrequent since his accident in 2013, especially from his family and this is the most expansive public statement about his condition since 2014.

In Brexit negotiations, no deadline is final. Reliably, it is the UK that needs an extension. Just as consistently, the reason is failure to understand the implications of something that had been agreed before the last deadline.
In accordance with that pattern, the government this week once again extended “grace periods” waiving checks for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. An early March deadline had been unilaterally abandoned by the UK; a second date of October was agreed with the European Commission. Now, David Frost, Brexit minister, says the waiver is to be indefinite “to provide space for potential further discussions” on changes to the Northern Ireland protocol.

                    <span>Readers respond to George Monbiot’s article on the impact of infrastructure projects on the environment
As ever, George Monbiot hits the nail on the head with his article emphasising the need to reduce building, especially roads that just exacerbate climate degradation (We can’t build our way out of the environmental crisis, 1 September). In particular, we all need to use less of everything and adopt the lifestyle mantra that “less is more”.
This is essential to reverse the vast number of lifestyle items that we have been persuaded to adopt over the past 20-30 years. These range from water sold to us in plastic bottles, to the “need” to travel further, faster, and in greater comfort. With a small amount of willpower, it is quite easy to adopt a slower, less carbon-intensive and more rewarding lifestyle. It remains an uphill struggle to convince others to follow suit and help bring about the “levelling up” needed to avoid further climate catastrophes.

                    <span>The far-right president has never hidden his admiration for dictatorship. There are growing fears he will not accept defeat in next year’s election
Though Jair Bolsonaro’s opponents warned of the dangers, most voters in the world’s fourth largest democracy were willing to elect a declared admirer of dictatorship. Many are now having second thoughts. The president’s popularity has plummeted, with almost two-thirds of Brazilians now rejecting him. Even those unfazed by the relentlessness of his aggressive ultra-conservatism have balked at a supreme court investigation into his own conduct and corruption allegations surrounding his allies and family, surging inflation and unemployment, and above all his decision to let Covid run rampant, killing more than 580,000 Brazilians.
But those who backed him are getting what they voted for: a man with unabashed disdain for democracy and admiration for force. On current polling, the popular though polarising former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would beat him easily in 2022’s election. Mr Bolsonaro is acting accordingly. The president has already sought to cast doubt on electronic voting, and limited the power of tech companies to remove content – making it harder to tackle disinformation. On Tuesday, he unleashed rallies in the country’s biggest cities, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília and São Paulo. Though not quite on the scale he hoped for, the crowds were still sufficiently large and fervid to send his message. If the supreme court does not shift its course, “it may suffer that which we don’t want”, Mr Bolsonaro warned. Diehard supporters had a less euphemistic version of how to handle his opponents: “Shut down the court,” and “Shoot them”.

My Covid-19 research team is also experiencing serious problems. Recently, our results questioned the clinical benefits of a drug called ivermectin. Anti-vaxxers claim that this drug is effective, and so can be used as an alternative to vaccines. However, several of the clinical trials suggesting benefits appear to be fraudulent. There is no evidence for clinical benefits when only high quality clinical trials are included.

For decades, many on the left have hankered for the social democratic political settlement of other European countries. Britain, it has been said, should ditch Thatcherism once and for all, and embrace higher taxes as the means of improving public services.
Now it has happened. As a result of the new health and social care levy, taxation will rise to its highest sustained level on record. This is the work not of a party of the left but of one of the right. Rishi Sunak may say he is a fiscal hawk who favours a small state and low taxes, but he is a tax-and-spend chancellor. Sajid Javid may have a picture of the Iron Lady on his office wall, but he is a tax-and-spend health secretary.

                    <span>Taxing wealth and scrapping the upper earnings limit on national insurance would address generational inequality

Alfie Stirling is head of economics at the New Economics Foundation

Tuesday’s announcements on national insurance contributions (NICs) will see working age adults pay disproportionately for what is overwhelmingly pension-age care. Buried on the same day was the news that departments are being asked to plan 5% cuts to “non-priority” services each year until 2024. Within just weeks the furlough scheme is set to be dissolved, with an estimated 1.9 million staff still being supported at the latest count. And by October, 5m households relying on universal credit will face the deepest overnight cut to welfare in UK history. It’s a cruel start to the government’s new parliamentary term. Expect the phrase “Brexit dividend” to keep a low profile this autumn.
The latest reforms have provoked a sense of unfairness around the treatment of generational wealth and income. In today’s Britain, how you make your money matters. If you rely on earnings for a living, the government has asked that you contribute an extra 2.5% of your wages towards the costs of social care – ultimately the 1.25 percentage point increase to both employee and employer NICs will each come out of workers’ take-home pay. If you’re paid in dividends, you’ve been asked to contribute an extra 1.25% of your wages. But if you take your income in interest, rent, capital gains or pension annuity you’re effectively exempt from the new levy.

Stephen Colbert returned to the Late Show from a two-week holiday with a questionable mustache and a full slate of bad news to recap. First, last week’s storm damage from Hurricane Ida, which knocked out power in Louisiana and dumped a record 3.15in of rain in a single hour in Central Park. The downpour flooded New York’s subways and delayed flights at Newark airport, whose baggage room was inundated. “So, pretty good day at Newark airport,” joked Colbert.

The attorney general’s office is considering whether to appeal against the jail term of four years and eight months handed to a man who choked his lover to death during sex.
Labour’s Harriet Harman, who chairs parliament’s joint committee on human rights, wrote to the attorney general to complain about the “unduly lenient” sentence handed on Tuesday to Sam Pybus for the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, a vulnerable 33-year-old.

Here is one thing Joe Root is certain about – Jos Buttler will be back in the England team as wicketkeeper and vice-captain for the fifth Test at Old Trafford. Beyond that Root has got plenty to ponder: about the make-up of his bowling attack, whether England ought to rest Jimmy Anderson or Ollie Robinson, if they should pick Jack Leach as a second spinner alongside Moeen Ali; what Buttler’s return means for the men who covered for him, Jonny Bairstow and Ollie Pope; if there is anything he can do to help fix his rickety slip cordon; and when, exactly, one of his middle order is going to give him some proper support by scoring a century.

Democrats including New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have decried Greg Abbott’s “deep ignorance” after the Texas governor inaccurately defended his state’s new anti-abortion law, saying that it does not require victims of rape and incest to carry pregnancies to term because it provides ample time for a person to get an abortion.
The law, which took effect on 1 September, is the most extreme anti-abortion measure in the US and essentially bans most abortions, offering no exceptions for rape or incest.

A fascinating cache of mostly unheard interview tapes with John Lennon is up for auction this month, offering an insight into topics including his favourite Beatles songs, his love for Yoko Ono, the corrupting power of fame and his feelings of hypocrisy over initially accepting an MBE.
The 91 minutes of recordings and interviews were conducted by a Canadian journalist, Ken Zeilig, on three occasions in 1969 and 1970, as the Beatles were beginning to fracture.

Green campaigners have criticised the UK government for apparently removing references to the temperature goals of the Paris climate agreement from a prospective trade deal with Australia.
According to Sky News in the UK, the trade deal – which was agreed in principle in June – was set to contain references to the Paris goals of limiting global heating to 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to a lower limit of 1.5C.

                    <span>Food banks and volunteers have put into practice the universalist principle that once underpinned the welfare state
When Slung Low theatre in Leeds closed during the first lockdown in March last year, its five core staff decided to stay put. The publicly funded theatre had cash and a van, so the staff leafleted the theatre’s neighbourhood in Holbeck, an impoverished area in south Leeds, offering to help with everyday tasks that had suddenly become impossible for many people. Requests piled in for grocery shopping, dog-walking and prescription pick-ups. As workplaces closed, people started asking for food support. Before long, the local council approached Slung Low, which normally stages large-scale theatre shows in castles and town centres, to organise a food bank for a ward of 7,500 residents. So it did, supplying around 15,000 deliveries over 15 months: thousands of eggs, cereal boxes, tins of beans and pints of milk.
Slung Low’s food bank was, like its theatre performances, a large-scale production. But it was by no means the only initiative of its kind to emerge during the pandemic. Over the past 18 months, 4,000 mutual aid groups formed across the country, staffed by millions of volunteers, who patched together safety nets for those in need. Whether delivering food, helping elderly people or supporting those with deteriorating mental health, many mutual aiders fast realised that help is a two-way street. For some, it provided an immediate way to practise political values. Other volunteers I spoke with said it offered them meaning and purpose in a way that actual, paid work did not.

I realised some time ago that chocolate brownies taste far better made with ground almonds than with flour, as they provide you with that wonderful fudgy texture, so these ones are gluten-free.
The ricotta lends moussiness to the finished brownies, and as one of my favourite flavour combinations is chocolate and raspberry (I’ve used Ocado’s own range raspberries), these disappear extremely quickly in my house. They’re as good to serve as a dessert as they are for an afternoon snack.

For those who have retired, the reforms will mean a temporary suspension of the triple lock which ensures state pensions rise annually by the highest of inflation, 2.5% or the average wage increase.

• Jackee Budesta Batanda is a Ugandan writer and entrepreneur
My gardener, Emmanuel, returned a few days ago after a five-month hiatus. One of the conditions for his return was that he needed to be vaccinated. He comes from Karamoja in the north-eastern part of Uganda, where the vaccine uptake was low, so he was able to get vaccinated.
I first thought that he was fibbing, as many Ugandans are prone to do when they get fake documents in order to get a pass. I checked his card and confirmed he had a genuine vaccination card. He told me that his whole family had been vaccinated.

                    <span>Exclusive: Germany’s possible next chancellor on his plans for Europe, tackling inequality and how to revive the centre-left
The new frontrunner to win Germany’s national vote at the end of this month says he believes he can reawaken Europe’s centre-left from its decade-long slumber with a two-fold promise: to guarantee his country’s continued economic success, while at the same time putting an end to the myth that individual success is always self-made.
Germany’s vice-chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has this summer surprisingly lifted his Social Democratic party (SPD) above Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in opinion polls, in large part due to a reputation for rational decision-making and fiscal prudence that mirrors that of the outgoing chancellor.

Leaseholders risk being “fleeced” by profiteering landlords and builders in the post-Grenfell fire safety crisis, a senior government adviser has warned in comments likely to increase pressure on ministers to finally resolve the problem.
More than four years after the disaster that claimed 72 lives, tens of thousands of leaseholders are being landed with crippling remediation bills exceeding £200,000 per household in the worst cases. But Dame Judith Hackitt is urging homeowners to challenge the demands by insisting on a second opinion, warning “profiteering” means “we are making lives worse than need be”.

                    <span>After months of uncertainty and being told to retrain, I got my chance to act at a beautiful and iconic theatre. Fair bit of pressure not to be rubbish …
It’s difficult to describe the feelings of jubilation, guilt, disbelief, confusion, gratitude and fear that came with the news that Shakespeare’s Globe would reopen and that I would be playing Flute in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, then Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth Night, then both concurrently. I couldn’t stop thanking God or panicking.
I’d had 15 months of uncertainty to prepare myself mentally, and when I finally drew into Blackfriars station on the Thames and saw the iconic thatched wooden “O” of the Globe sitting on the riverbank, living, as it had, in my dreams for over a year, I started hyperventilating the second I alighted. I regained composure long enough to wave some masked hellos to the strangers I would be spending the next six months with, then lost it all again when we made our introductions on stage. I have an occasional stammer that hasn’t really troubled me since my mid-20s. It came blazing back the second I tried to say “Fouracres” and “playing”, then us brand-newbies were introduced to the building.

I was asleep when the first plane hit. At the time, I lived just four blocks from the World Trade Center, right next to a hospital, a fire station and the HQ of the New York police. The sirens woke me up. They were nonstop. I turned on the television and saw one of the towers on fire. As I watched the second plane hit the south tower on TV, I also heard it because I lived so close.
I was working for Associated Press (AP) as a photo editor. I knew, as their closest staff member, that I should go out and document it. I got dressed, threw some film into my camera bag, and ran out to the World Trade Center. A lot of photography is like muscle memory. Even in a situation like this, your body knows exactly what to do. I remember a cop asking me: “How can you take photographs?” I told him: “I have to document this. It’s history.”

                    <span>Once seemingly a fast track to cancellation, TV shows are again dancing around the censors with almost-curse words in their titles. But do they still make viewers go WTF?
When Eugene and Dan Levy were first pitching their idea for a comedy about a wealthy family who go broke, there was one major stumbling block: the name. When several channels asked them to change the title from Schitt’s Creek to something less vulgar, the Levys doubled down. They pulled out pages from a phone directory to prove that there were actual people with the sweary surname. “If CBC was doing a news broadcast with the name Schitt, would you not use it?”, Eugene Levy told the Toronto Star. “They said: ‘Yes, we would air the name.’” After throwing it at the network’s wall, they finally got Schitt to stick.
But when it aired in 2015, the series was not without its issues. NPR had to spell out the word when talking about it; some channels, such as CBS, had to flash up what’s known as “the lower third” – subtitles literally spelling it out – every time they mentioned it on air. Some TV and radio stations were reduced to simply calling it “Creek”, presumably confusing both Dawson’s Creek and Jonathan Creek fans in the process.

                    <span>This characteristically Southern belle of a dish can be made in many ways, but which version is the cream of the crop?
Corn in this country has two distinct seasons: tuna-and-sweetcorn sandwich season, which runs from October to July, and the current barbecued corn on the cob season, in which we choose to floss our gums on something that is somehow simultaneously hotter than the sun and almost completely raw. Our lack of expertise is perhaps understandable, since the maize family is native to the Americas, and gained popularity as human food in this country only relatively recently.
Not for us the myriad celebratory festivals that pepper the American Midwest in summer, many of which culminate in the crowning of a sweetcorn queen – though I must draw your attention to the Isle of Wight’s Sweetcorn Fayre at the end of September, which promises visitors a giant sweetcorn fritter – nor the many different ways to enjoy it, from chowder to succotash. Perhaps my favourite, however, is this particularly Southern take, available year round in a tin but, in my opinion, only really worth eating fresh.

At the end of August, as part of my long-term work on the global climate emergency, I travelled to Evia in Greece to explore the impacts of the unprecedented fires that had devastated village communities and the ecology of the island. I chose not to chase the drama of the burning flames, but rather to seek out their aftermath. I encountered endless blackened landscapes and made these portraits of people whose lives have been destroyed by the fire they describe as a “burning hell”. I know that it was not easy for my subjects to return to their homes to be photographed, and for some this was the first time that they had stepped inside since the fire. However, I found that they embraced this moment of having their fractured situation witnessed and were keen to share their stories. I was moved by their openness to my camera after all the horrors of their recent experience. Visually I found that an eerily precise symmetry seemed to emerge from the unspeakable chaos of their ruined homes, many of which are situated in places of profound beauty. I hope that their gaze at the camera will provoke a visceral sense of the climate threat we all face.

                    <span>Rupali Sharma of the Lawyering Project explains how SB8 lawsuits could damage the careers and lives of abortion providers and patients
Last week, the most severe abortion restriction in the country became law in Texas. SB8 is a six-week abortion ban, which amounts to more or less an outright ban, since many people don’t know they’re pregnant until after the six-week mark. Abortion clinics in the state have estimated that the law bans somewhere between 85% and 90% of the procedures they provide.
But perhaps the most shocking part of the law is how it’s enforced: SB8 is enforced not by the state attorney general or other government officials, but by private citizens, who are encouraged to snitch on people who violate the abortion ban by filing civil lawsuits against them. (And they are promised a minimum of $10,000 in “damages” if they win the suit – what abortion rights supporters are calling a “bounty”.) The threat of litigation and financial ruin has forced clinics across the state to comply with the law, even though its core principle – banning abortion – is still unconstitutional.

Dozens of indigenous meetings are happening at the summit – which occurs every four years – with representatives from 23 organisations.

Michael Grandage’s film My Policeman, which has just finished filming in Brighton, tells the story of a married couple in a loving and enduring menage a trois. The third party is the husband’s male lover.
The adaptation of Bethan Roberts’ novel covers a period in recent English history – stretching from the 1950s to the 90s – when attitudes to homosexuality underwent significant change. What was once illegal, and supposedly scorned by right-thinking members of society, became accepted to the extent that, in 2014, same-sex marriage was recognised in law.

More than 100 former students at a troubled London academy have published an open letter to its governors, Ofsted and the government alleging a catalogue of serious failings in pastoral care and safeguarding of pupils, including “off-rolling” of some students and failure to act appropriately in peer-on-peer sexual assault.
The letter from former students at Holland Park school, which is judged “outstanding” by Ofsted and boasts the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and former Commons speaker John Bercow among parents, comes only a month after the Guardian revealed that an independent inquiry into alleged bullying and intimidation of staff, and the withholding of staff questionnaires from school inspectors, had been commissioned by the governing body.

But after she began live-streaming her journey and her struggles, she became a Chinese internet sensation with online fans sending her donations to fund her new life. Su has become an accidental feminist icon, inspiring other women to leave behind restrictive gender expectations for a life of adventure.

                    <span>We would like to hear from SME owners on how they feel about paying for the new healthcare levy
A £12bn healthcare levy announced by Boris Johnson as part of health and social care reforms, is expected to be ushered in by MPs on Wednesday. Breaking an explicit manifesto promise, the levy will mean a 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions. Employers and directors of small companies will also pay an additional 1.25% tax on dividends for employees earning about the class 1 secondary threshold.
We would like to hear from small business owners on their reaction to the new health and social care levy.

                    <span>One of Bollywood’s most bankable actors has written a revolutionary pregnancy book that lifts the lid on libido, caesareans and more. She discusses power, pay and the reality behind the glamour
Days after giving birth to her first child – an emergency caesarean after the cord had wrapped itself around the baby’s neck – Kareena Kapoor Khan stood undressed and alone in front of a mirror in her bedroom. “There I was: scarred, chubby, puffy, tired,” she recalls of that moment in 2016. “I saw the baby bulge, the dark circles, the dressing bandage of my C-incision. I cannot describe how I felt.”
The image is stark; after all, if there is such a thing as Bollywood royalty, Kapoor Khan is it. The daughter of Bollywood legends, often described as among the most glamorous women in Bollywood, she is married to one of the leading actors of Hindi cinema and over two decades has become one of India’s most bankable stars.
Nonetheless, 20 years in the limelight has not stopped Kapoor Khan being open about parts of her life that most celebrities keep hidden. This has always set her apart in Bollywood and it is this approach that she has brought to her most recent project.

I held them in awe. My supervisors at Newnham College, Cambridge, in the 50s were of the generation who had served in the war: Bletchley Park, the Board of Trade, that kind of thing. They were fiercely intelligent in a way my schoolteachers had not been. I was brimming with admiration and fear. It was why I had studied hard to be there, to pit my wit against the finest in the land. But I was to come a cropper severely. In the end, it served me well enough. But the pain remains.
I had studied economics in my first year. My supervisor was Ruth Cohen, who sat on the floor in dishevelled tweeds, her legs wide and an ashtray between, to catch the ash from her continual smoking. Needless to say, she was brilliant. Soon she would be made college principal, take herself off for a makeover and emerge, neat, tidy, almost smart, to lead the college with style.

Ronald L Banks was just 21 when he stood in front of his closet containing 60 pairs of jeans, a huge collection of shoes, and a wardrobe full of T-shirts and thought, “this has to stop”. He took out each item of clothing, examining them closely. Inspired by the Marie Kondo method, he asked himself the meaning that each held – and if he couldn’t answer, he donated them.
Banks, a prominent YouTuber, has a channel of 130,000 fans. He broadcasts from his apartment in Wisconsin – which is pristine. His furniture consists of a sofa, a TV, a wood table and four chairs, some houseplants and paintings. He just has enough basics to get by. He chooses to live with this little, he explains, because “minimalism is living with more of what matters by choosing to want less of what doesn’t,” he says in a video.

                    <span>Vietnam was a Covid success story but the latest lockdown, with people unable to leave the house even for food, is leaving tens of thousands hungry
When the strictest lockdown to date was imposed in Ho Chi Minh City, Tran Thi Hao*, a factory worker, was told that the government would keep her and her family well fed – but for two months they have eaten little more than rice and fish sauce.
She was put on unpaid leave from her job in July, while her husband, a construction worker, has not worked for months. They are behind on their rent, with another payment due soon.

                    <span>The past 18 months have left many parents and carers feeling overwhelmed, irritable and wrung bone dry. Can balance ever be restored?
“I’m tired of how blurred the lines are between home and work,” Julia Thomas tells me as her two boys repeatedly ask for snacks in the background. Thomas lives in London with her husband, twin 11-year-old boys and a daughter, seven. She is a civil servant, but says she is feeling so burned out by childcare that she’s considering quitting her job completely. She isn’t sleeping properly, her back and hips ache from sitting at a desk all day and her constant to-do list makes life feel chaotic.
“Quitting my job feels like a big deal. I feel guilty, as if I’m letting the sisterhood down – but this situation is untenable,” she says. “The children are downstairs, while my husband and I are upstairs on Zoom meetings. We can still hear the sibling fights, even when we’re working, and when it gets bad they bring the problem to you.”

But this season’s hero pieces are not designer-lookalikes in the vein of 2013’s sellout pink coat, or celebrity favourites such as 2015’s as-seen-on Alexa Chung suede skirt. In 2021, the stars of the show are colourful tracksuits, quilted coats and non-wired bras.

The 20th anniversary of 9/11 and its fallout was always going to be a moment of deep soul searching about what has been lost and learned.
But the retrospective, until a few weeks ago, risked having a historical, even sepia, quality as the attention of political leaders moved to a more contemporary set of threats – health pandemics, climate emergencies, Big Tech and great power competition, including the rise of China. The “war on terror”, after all, looked if not won, at least drawn. It was even possible Islamist terrorism was a temporary manageable phenomenon, increasingly confined to Africa and some lethal loners in European shopping centres.

In the first of three episodes examining the reverberations of the attacks 20 years on, three of that group reflect on the weight of that private grief – and what it meant to grow up with it in the media spotlight
Mike and Dan Friedman were 11 years old when their father, Andrew, died on 9/11. Robyn Higley, whose father Robert also died in the attacks, was yet to be born.
The loss they suffered is unimaginable to most of us – but they are part of a group of 3,051 children who lost a parent, 105 of them when they were still in the womb. Ahead of the 20th anniversary of the attacks, in the first of three episodes examining the consequences and reverberations of that day, Robyn, Mike and Dan describe what it was like to grow up with their private grief so inextricably tied to a seismic global tragedy. And Ed Pilkington, the chief reporter for Guardian US, tells Michael Safi about the meaning of the anniversary to the bereaved, and how tokens their parents left behind and their pride in dealing with the loss has helped sustain them in the two decades since.

Seventeen patients, most of them suffering from Covid-19, have died after a hospital in central Mexico flooded when torrential rain caused a river to burst its banks.
More than 40 other patients in the public hospital in the town of Tula in Hidalgo state were evacuated by emergency service workers on Tuesday, and an initial assessment showed about 2,000 houses had flood damage, the Mexican government said in a statement.

Kono has used his platform on Twitter – where his Japanese account has nearly 2.4 million followers and his English-language one nearly 50,000 – to berate civil servants for working into the wee hours and holding late-night press conferences.

First, it was North Korea. Then, came Myanmar. Now, it is Afghanistan. The three ongoing crises in China’s neighbourhood seem to have little in common. But for Beijing, they pose the same question: how to deal with strategically important yet failing states on its border, and how will China’s response define its identity as a global power.
For many years, China watchers in the west have been looking for clues to how a rising power will exercise its influence on the world stage through its involvement in Africa or its relations with the US. But the way China approaches the three neighbouring countries may provide a clearer picture.

One in five of all those living with cancer (21%) are lacking dedicated support. The NHS is suffering from a “shocking” shortfall of 3,000 specialist nurses in England alone, according to the analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support.

                    <span>Shake-up of UK parliamentary map would cut number of Welsh MPs in Westminster from 40 to 32
Proposals for a huge shake-up of the UK parliamentary map in Wales have provoked criticism for threatening to break up tight-knit valley communities in the south and creating vast, unwieldy rural constituencies.
The Boundary Commission for Wales admitted that the proposed changes, announced on Wednesday, were significant” but said the decision of the UK parliament to reduce the number of Welsh MPs in Westminster from 40 to 32 had meant it had to re-draw the map for all but one of the nation’s constituencies.

Accounts filed at Companies House this week show that the corporation tax contribution of Amazon UK Services – the group’s warehouse and logistics operation, thought to employ the majority of the group’s UK workforce – was £18.3m in the year to December 2020, up 26% from £14.5m a year before.

England top Group I but face sternest test yet in Warsaw

Gareth Southgate has said that England are going into games full of confidence after proving they can compete with the best at Euro 2020 but has warned against complacency.
England are firmly in control of their World Cup qualifying group before facing Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday night and Southgate is determined to enjoy the good moments. The manager was delighted with his side’s attitude in last week’s 4-0 win over Hungary and he believes that they are determined to push on after losing to Italy in the final of the Euros.

Victorious in Vienna thanks to Lyndon Dykes’ second winning goal in two games, Steve Clarke’s side seized control of their destiny in Group F with a memorable triumph over Austria. Israel’s resounding defeat at runaway leaders Denmark provided extra gloss.
Scotland defended superbly throughout, attacked with menace, worked tirelessly and profited from a VAR decision to award the penalty that Dykes just about converted. The reward was not simply three points, but momentum at a critical stage in the campaign and second place in the group, with closest rivals Israel due at Hampden Park next month. What an occasion that promises to be.

                    <span>At last Stephen Kenny’s luck turned. Another dispiriting defeat loomed for the Republic of Ireland– along with the definitive end of their remote World Cup qualification hopes – until a freakish late own goal by Nikola Milenkovic. The defender could do nothing about it, the ball having been blasted against him by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who had put Serbia into the lead in the first half.
Debate swirled before the game about what the repercussions of another defeat might be for Kenny. The manager insisted he was engaged in a development strategy whose fruits might not ripen until Euro 2024 but a couple of local reports suggested the patience of at least some officials at the Football Association of Ireland was wearing thin. The public is split between fans who claim Kenny’s methods will never work and those who maintain he deserves more time to implement a daring revolution in a country reaping the consequences of years of chronic neglect by the FAI.

The number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals across the US this Labor Day weekend was nearly 300% higher than this time last year, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The average number of deaths was over 86% higher than the same period last year.
The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

Aaron O’Halloran’s “idiotic actions” on a stretch of track between Duddeston and Aston stations in Birmingham on 9 May, which were caught on CCTV, caused more than £23,000 worth of damage, British Transport Police (BTP) said.

With less than two months to go before the talks, the Climate Action Network (CAN), a global alliance of more than 1,500 civil society organisations, is warning that many delegates from the global south will be unable to attend due to vaccine inequity and prohibitive quarantine costs.

Mexico’s supreme court has struck down a state abortion law, ruling that criminal penalties for terminating pregnancies are unconstitutional, in a decision which advocates say provides a path to decriminalisation across the country.
In a unanimous 10-0 ruling, the top court ordered the northern state of Coahuila to remove sanctions for abortion from its criminal code – with several justices arguing the prohibitions on voluntarily interrupting a pregnancy violated women’s rights to control their own bodies.

Old Henry premieres at the Sala Grande here at Venice, with the sea at its front and the gondolas at its back and it’s hard to imagine a less appropriate setting. Potsy Ponciroli’s film is a rootin’ tootin’ barrel of wild-west cliches, complete with bank robbers, a scared kid and a dastardly villain who wears a black hat. The programmers could at least have played ball and put some saloon doors at the entrance, sawdust on the floor, maybe a spittoon by each seat.
Tim Blake Nelson grabs a rare and deserved title role as Henry, an ornery old pig farmer who may (slight spoiler) be a stone-cold cowboy killer in flight from a past he’d rather not talk about, dagnammit. Even so, Henry’s currently doing fine. He has a meek teenage son, Wyatt (Gavin Lewis) and a mess of hogs out the back. “Don’t it ever bother you sometimes that they eat their own?” asks Wyatt, but this doesn’t worry Henry, who surely saw far worse things occur during the bad old life that he may or may not have lived in the past.

The prime minister, once again, had to level with us. Flanked by his chancellor and health secretary, he kicked off with some truth bombs. NHS waiting lists would get worse before they got better. Social care wouldn’t improve without more money, and that money must come from tax.
It couldn’t come from more borrowing, he implored. Rishi Sunak chimed in later to deepen the point: debt was irresponsible and dishonest. Sajid Javid couldn’t have agreed more strongly. What was the point in hearing from all three of them, one might wonder, when they were all of exactly the same mind while making a very simple point, like Newsround-does-tax?

Three individuals, wearing sharp suits and armed with guns, robbed the recently revamped boutique on the Place Vendôme in central Paris, where the Ritz hotel is located, shortly before midday on Tuesday, police said.

There were shouts of “lawbreakers” and “go home” as 15 migrants staggered on to the shingle of Dungeness beach in Kent, greeted by a handful of hostile onlookers. One woman also directed her anger at the lifeboat crew who rescued those making the dangerous journey across the Channel by small boat. “Traitors,” she yelled repeatedly.
Those who made it ashore on Tuesday included three Eritrean teenagers. “I’m fine but I got a little bit in the water,” said one. His jeans were soaked through. “I have a brother here, I think in London,” he said, but he didn’t want to add more. “I am too hungry.”

MPs are set to usher in a historic £12bn healthcare levy on Wednesday, pushing the tax burden to a record peacetime level as Boris Johnson stakes his political reputation on attempting to fix the creaking health and care systems.
Setting out the radical plan for a carved-out healthcare tax, Johnson willingly conceded that the 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) – to be rebadged a health and social care levy – would break an explicit manifesto promise.

The Taliban have announced an all-male caretaker government including an interior minister wanted by the FBI, on a day when at least two people were killed by violent policing of street protests against the new authorities.
The leadership unveiled on Tuesday is drawn entirely from Taliban ranks, despite promises of an inclusive cabinet, and many of its senior figures are on UN sanctions lists, which is likely to complicate the group’s search for international recognition.

The maternity ward mix-up, which health authorities in the La Rioja region have attributed to “human error”, came to light by chance after a DNA test.

Manchester City and Gareth Bale are the latest voices to oppose a biennial World Cup amid widespread anger at Fifa’s lack of consultation over plans to radically alter the football calendar.
The proposals – which have been developed by Arsène Wenger, Fifa’s chief of global football development – would lead to a World Cup or European Championship every summer, as well as potentially no club football in October while international qualifiers are played instead.

                    <span>The boost to health and care spending is needed, but troubling details, and unfairness, remain
In 2019, in his first speech as prime minister, Boris Johnson promised to fix the crisis in social care “once and for all”. Two years later, a plan has arrived as part of a mishmash announcement that also tries to address the enormous problem of demand facing the NHS, and rising anger about intergenerational unfairness. The best part of Tuesday’s news is the money: around £12bn a year to be shared between health and social care for each of the next three years. This is likely to be a broadly popular measure; polls show that the public is willing to stump up taxes to pay for a better service. And the NHS desperately needs it, with waiting lists at their highest ever levels in England.
To achieve this, the prime minister has calculated that his MPs, and voters, will swallow the pill of broken manifesto promises. This includes the announcement that the pensions triple lock will be removed next year, as well as the 1.25% rise in national insurance contributions plus 1.25% from employers that (along with a tax on dividends) is the mechanism chosen to deliver new funding. With the proposed cut to universal credit, 2.5 million working families will shell out £1,300 a year. From 2023-24 when government systems have been updated, payslips will show a “health and care levy”, including those of workers over the state pension age (who until now have been exempt from NI). By branding the portion of the new money that will be channelled to the devolved administrations a “union dividend”, the government hopes to bind them to the UK.

                    <span>A government proposal to ease restrictions on the sale of imported cultural works risks harming a world-class industry
The hoopla around the release of Sally Rooney’s new novel on Tuesday – with bookshops opening early, and queues of shoppers eager to lay their hands on Beautiful World, Where Are You – has contributed to the image of a publishing industry in rude health. Last year had the highest sales in eight years. Yet authors, bricks-and-mortar bookshops and publishers alike fear that the industry faces a powerful new threat, if cheap editions legitimately produced for an overseas market are allowed to be sold in the UK. Kazuo Ishiguro, Bernardine Evaristo and others have warned that the effect on writers would be devastating.
EU regulations meant that UK producers could prevent the importation of such books into Britain; in the wake of Brexit, the government is considering reversing this. A report proposes to change how we deal with the exhaustion of intellectual property rights. The document, from a taskforce headed by Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and George Freeman, argues that, apart from limited exceptions, “in general, protectionist use of IP rights should be resisted”. It suggests that we liberalise parallel import laws “to reduce prices and increase choice for consumers” (in notes from a familiar Tory hymn sheet). This would mean that a non-UK publisher, say, that has legitimately bought the rights to publish Harry Potter, could then sell those books back into Britain. Where they are cheaper, reflecting lower costs and consumer incomes in those markets, the original producers would be at a disadvantage.

Old Trafford was deemed to be the less comfortable of the two biosecure venues by England’s men last summer, with its city location and smaller perimeter a distant second to the leafy golf resort that is the Ageas Bowl. Some even called it an “open prison”.
But cricket-wise the old ground was also the scene of the three Test wins they managed to secure during that weird season – two against West Indies, one against Pakistan – and thus a source of encouragement as Joe Root’s now weary-looking side hope to beat India in Friday’s fifth Test and escape with a drawn series.

That’s a relief – especially for Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. TransDigm, by a distance the more problematic of the two bidders for Meggitt, the Coventry-based maker of components for commercial and military aircraft, is out of the race. The Ohio-based firm yanked its £7bn proposal on Tuesday and grumbled about “the quite limited due diligence information” that Meggitt made available.
You got the same data as Parker-Hannifin, the other contender, Meggitt quickly replied, giving a hint of the tensions behind the scenes. One speculative reading of that sub-plot is that TransDigm, already borrowed up to the eyeballs by conventional yardsticks, required every last financial detail to make its lenders comfortable.

Andy Cowper writes a weekly column for Health Policy Insight

Boris Johnson today announced the government’s new plan for social care. Entitled Build Back Better, and trailed by an extensive media briefing war between the prime minister and chancellor over the past few weeks, this plan makes various financial commitments on the NHS and social care funding.
It’s worth remembering Johnson’s words, as he stood in front of No 10 on his first day as prime minister, more than two years ago: “My job is to make sure you don’t have to wait three weeks to see your GP, and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the frontline.

The country’s Chivo wallet – which offers $30 worth of bitcoin free for local users – launched at midnight, but five hours later was disconnected due to a lack of server capacity. Seemingly unfazed, President Nayib Bukele asked for patience, announced that the government had purchased an additional 150 bitcoins, bringing the total holdings to 550 ($26m). Then he retweeted a US bitcoin journalist who had successfully paid for his McDonald’s breakfast using the cryptocurrency.

                    <span>Pre-trial process for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others defendants is in its ninth year with no clear end in sight
Nearly 20 years after the 9/11 attacks, the man accused of orchestrating the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, has appeared along four other defendants, for the first hearing in over 18 months at a Guantánamo Bay military tribunal.
The trial of the five accused for their role in the attacks has yet to begin. The session which began on Tuesday was the resumption of pre-trial hearings, now in their ninth year and with no clear end in sight. They have been bogged down in procedural problems and the central issue haunting the entire process, the admissibility of evidence obtained by the CIA under torture.

Bills to set up a national care service and reform the Gender Recognition Act, as well as proposals for private sector rent controls by the end of this year, all featured in Sturgeon’s plan for the year to come in Holyrood.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Justin Trudeau has been hit by a handful of gravel as anti-vaccination protesters targeted the Canadian prime minister’s campaign for re-election.
A CTV camera captured what appears to be white gravel hitting Trudeau and one of his bodyguards as he walked toward his campaign bus in London, Ontario. The Liberals cancelled an event late last month because of safety concerns linked to anti-vax protesters.

James Rebanks’s story of his family’s farm in the Cumbrian Fells, English Pastoral, has won the Wainwright nature writing prize, praised as a “seminal work which will still be celebrated in 50 years”.
The follow-up to Rebanks’s memoir The Shepherd’s Life, English Pastoral tells of the home in the Lake District, where his family have lived and worked for more than 600 years, and how he began to farm in a more sustainable way. It was up against titles including Raynor Winn’s follow-up to The Salt Path, The Wild Silence, for the award, which is named after writer and fellwalker Alfred Wainwright and which goes to the book that “most successfully inspires readers to explore the outdoors and to nurture a respect for the natural world”.

It wasn’t quite the “Hello world” of Tiger Woods in 1996. Nonetheless, Trans World Sport’s feature on 13-year-old twins in rural Ireland taking the “junior golf world by storm” at least hinted at greater things to come. Now 26, Leona Maguire’s rise to the top has been steady rather than sharp; and completely by design.
Maguire was easily the star of the show as Europe retained the Solheim Cup in Toledo, Ohio. Four and a half points from a possible five made this one of the finest team golf debuts in history.

Squad for October tournament announced on Thursday

Ben Stokes looks set to be missing when England announce their squad for this year’s T20 World Cup campaign on Thursday. The all-rounder, 30, was the star for Eoin Morgan’s white-ball side when they won the 50-over World Cup in 2019 and, though less dominant in T20 cricket, was still central to their goal of uniting the titles in the United Arab Emirates next month.
However Stokes is currently taking an indefinite break from cricket in order to prioritise his mental health and continue rehabilitation from finger surgery in April and England’s head coach, Chris Silverwood, appears unwilling to rush a second return after Stokes briefly captained a depleted 50-over side earlier this summer.

In the former red wall seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central, which the Conservatives won for the first time in 2019 with a majority of just 670, opinion on the government’s new plans for health and social care funding was split.
In one camp were many who felt the national insurance hike was justifiable, a post-pandemic necessity to fund a struggling NHS and social care sector, and it was only fair that the burden should be shared across the population.

Nesrine Malik’s excellent article (For Afghan refugees Britain’s warm welcome will soon become cold comfort, 6 September) highlights many of the issues facing Afghan refugees. Unfortunately, once asylum status has been granted, the second layer of bureaucracy awaits them. Unless they can find immediate employment, which pays enough to support themselves and their family without the need for state support, those granted leave to remain will enter the benefits system administered by the Department for Work and Pensions.
The benefits system caps assistance offered with both housing costs and support for children – no universal credit payable for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017.

                    <span>Effective support requires the provision of basic needs but services are overwhelmed, writes Siobhan Bryant
As a senior child and adolescent mental health nurse working in the NHS, I cannot agree more that young people need more than antidepressants (Children face a mental health crisis, but they need more than antidepressants, 4 September). I would go further and say that they also need more than therapy or talking-cure interventions. They need mental health interventions joined with other vital government agencies in order to make effective changes to their lived experience.
I meet many children and young people who are suffering because of very poor housing, serious parental mental health issues and the unavailability of a social worker to support the complex needs of the family. But I am unable to access the necessary support from appropriate agencies to address these issues. The reason is because these agencies, in particular children’s services, are overwhelmed with referrals and unable to respond. This means that as a society we are not able to safeguard a generation of children and young people.

Playing stick-up man Omar Little on The Wire, Michael K Williams was tough, frightening and brutal – his face scarred, his smile wide, toting a shotgun and wearing a long trenchcoat. So viewers of David Simon’s intricate TV portrait of Baltimore’s streets, docks, schools and politics felt the rug pulled from under them when they first saw him kiss his boyfriend in episode four of season one.
It was a moment that subverted audience expectations and signalled the complexity, ambition and depth that The Wire – which is often placed at or near the top of lists of the all-time greatest TV shows – was aiming to achieve. This is not a character you’ve seen before, the show seemed to be saying. These aren’t your usual stereotypes and cliches. A similar moment saw Idris Elba’s drug chief Stringer Bell attend a business studies class.

                    <span>A one-off boost to pensions now isn’t unfair if it means greater security in retirement for generations to come
The “triple lock” is the most high-profile and contested area of pensions policy. It is also the most misunderstood. The lock, which ensures state pensions rise annually by the highest of average earnings growth, inflation or 2.5%, is almost always discussed in terms of the trade-off between pensioner benefits and working-age benefits. But to frame it simply like this is an error.
Thérèse Coffey has today announced the suspension of the triple lock. It will be welcomed by those who believe we need to rebalance public spending from the old to the young. However, despite many arguments to the contrary, young people are in fact among the main beneficiaries of the triple lock. They would actually suffer from its removal.

Animals are increasingly “shapeshifting” because of the climate crisis, researchers have said.
Warm-blooded animals are changing their physiology to adapt to a hotter climate, the scientists found. This includes getting larger beaks, legs and ears to better regulate their body temperature.

                    <span>The prime minister had a chance to effect real reform. Instead, he chose the Tory base over disabled people and care workers
Two years after Boris Johnson promised a plan for social care, it can hardly be said that today’s announcement was “worth the wait”. As one Tory backbencher put it, “If the ‘big reveal’ of a decade of thinking is this, then some people want sacking.”
Unlike the NHS, social care – be it long-term support for elderly people in residential homes, or assistance to disabled people in their own homes – is not free at the point of use in England. Instead, it has been means-tested and provided by a patchwork of individuals, charities and private companies all overseen by local authorities.

While being a welcome change for many, there are concerns about whether the process is affordable for all and the impact on children of much older parents. Four women around the UK share their views on the announcement.

Barry Hearn is meant to have retired but here we are in his swanky old office talking about his certainty that his son, Eddie, would beat Jake Paul in a pay-per-view extravaganza that would generate millions of pounds. We are in the midst of a long and reflective interview about sport and life, work and fame, mortality and marriage, which includes Hearn’s memories of starting out in promotion 40 years ago in a grimy little office beneath a snooker hall in Romford as well as his new ambition to play cricket for England’s over-70 team.
“As Jake Paul has shown, you don’t have to be good now. You just have to be famous,” Hearn says amiably as he considers our changed world. “So that brings in a different expertise. How do I make you famous even though you’re not very good?”

Duwa Lashi La, the acting president of the National Unity Government (NUG), said Tuesday marked the beginning of a nationwide revolt. He warned people to avoid unnecessary travel and stock up on essentials.

The chancellor, who will stand down after federal elections on 26 September, warned of the possibility of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Greens governing the country in a coalition with the far-left Die Linke.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Downing Street has not ruled out a “firebreak” lockdown as a last resort if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by Covid cases in England, but denied there were plans for one during October’s half-term school holiday.
With deaths within 28 days of a positive test reaching 209 – their highest level since 1 March – and 37,489 positive cases on Tuesday, scientists warned that restrictions could again be necessary in the coming months, such as limits on gatherings and a return to compulsory indoor masking.

                    <span>Poor HRH. Why must misfortune dog him, when his only crime is a passion for lovely things paid for by other people?
One of my favourite modern curiosities is the “diversity and inclusion” page on the official website of the British royal family. “We are proud to champion diversity throughout the organisation,” this auto-satirical cri de coeur runs. “We employ and reward the very best talent, regardless of gender, race, ethnic or national origin, disability, religion, sexual orientation or age. And that’s how we seek out future potential too, recruiting from the widest available pool. Our approach to recruitment and selection is fair, open and based purely on merit.”
On what, sorry? If your reflexive response to this is to cackle “BUT YOU’RE LITERALLY A HEREDITARY MONARCHY, YOU MAD BASTARDS”, then please: just relax. Simply allow the sentiment to splash on to you, like royal urine into a sample bottle that a valet is holding, and realise that we live in times where “diversity” can mean whatever the firm talking about it wants it to mean. In this case, a commitment to getting more black servants. (You may recall that the House of Windsor did have one mixed-race senior manager, but she and her husband left the organisation last year to take up a position with Netflix.) So yes, it doesn’t matter that this “firm” is one where – by law – you only get the big jobs because of who your parents are. As for that bit about “recruiting from the widest available pool”, you should simply read it as a reference to having made a mildly concerted effort to finally stop interbreeding with their cousins. “We would never want a certain type,” this advanced bollocks insists. “The key is to be individual and different.”

Performers and audiences who are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) are being shut out of the arts due to a lack of ongoing safety provisions, according to a number of people within the sector who cite a “two-tier” cultural reopening.
While the rest of the population has been able to return to watching and taking part in live music and performance as of the end of July, those who are clinically vulnerable, who number around 3.7m or 6.7% of the British population, are still waiting for their freedom day.

It’s hard enough navigating the many pitfalls of the packed lunch, but remove the ability to heat or chill it, and no one would blame Fred for hotfooting it to his nearest Pret. Meat and fish, say, don’t take kindly to sitting in a sweaty sandwich bag for hours on end, so it’s wise to keep things veggie.

The government has announced the NHS will get £36bn over the next three years which will be funded by a new “health and social care levy,” which will be 1.25% paid by working adults, including those over the state pension age.
From October 2023, anyone with assets between £20,000 and £100,000 will be expected to contribute to the cost of their adult social care care, but will also be eligible for state support covering some of the costs. This support will be means tested, and no one will ever have to pay more than £86,000 for care in their lifetime - roughly equivalent to three years of care.

In May 2020, the playwright Bess Wohl rented a house in Bellport, Long Island, a bayside village an hour or two from Manhattan. This was during the early months of the pandemic, when Wohl found herself running an impromptu summer camp for her three young children. With what little downtime she had, she began to Google the history of the area, becoming curious about a nearby town called Yaphank.
In the 1930s, Yaphank hosted a summer camp for German-American youth who dressed in brown shirts and jackboots. They marched along Adolf Hitler Street and Goebbels Street, greeting one another with cries of “Heil Hitler”. Flowerbeds were planted in the shape of swastikas.

                    <span>Criticism of move to end prosecutions says it is broader than almost 300 other amnesties around world
The UK government’s plan to end all Troubles-era prosecutions in Northern Ireland would create an amnesty wider than the one Augusto Pinochet introduced to shield human rights violators in Chile, according to a study.
Downing Street’s plan would offer a level of impunity more sweeping than almost 300 other post-conflict amnesties introduced around the world, said the report, published on Tuesday.

Kale is an exhausting food – not because of how it tastes, but for its role in the never-ending culture war. It’s a symbol of wishy-washy, out-of-touch wellness culture, and is therefore considered with suspicion by a certain segment of society. Which is silly, not least because kale is actually excellent. Stop being a baby, buy some kale and then make these recipes.

A day before he goes on trial in the French capital, Belgian public broadcaster RTBF has released an interview with the alleged kingpin of the Paris terror attacks, recorded as he was fleeing France in the aftermath of the 2015 massacre.
Salah Abdeslam and 19 others are accused of planning, aiding and carrying out the 13 November suicide bomb and gun attacks on the Stade de France, bars, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall that killed 130 people and injured 490.

John Henry Ramirez does not want to die alone. The Texas prisoner knows that at his execution, scheduled for Wednesday evening, he will be able to see witnesses through a pane of glass. A stoic prison official will probably be standing near his head. But as a devout Protestant Christian, he wants his pastor to lay a hand on him as he dies.
“It’s part of my faith – there’s so much about the power of touch,” Ramirez told the Marshall Project during an interview last week. “You bless someone at the time of their most spiritual need.”

                    <span>By baby No 2, I just wanted a good night’s sleep. But my journey into baby tech taught me something else, writes Sophie Brickman

When my daughter Ella was little, I’d often see various tech products on my Facebook feed purporting to calm parents who were anxious about their baby’s sleep. Next to feeding, there’s likely no more anxiety-prone part of the day than a child’s bedtime – the fear they’re not on a schedule, or that once they get on one, it’s the wrong one, or that once they’re actually asleep, they might never wake up.
I dismissed them out of hand – we were sharing a room with Ella, and I was aware of her every snort and snuffle, though in retrospect, it seems obvious that we could have had her sleeping through the night a little earlier … if we’d only settled on a sleep training method.

                    <span>Amid Trump, #MeToo and rising hate crime, science writer Melinda Wenner Moyer decided it was time to learn how to stop her kids becoming ‘assholes’. Her research became an unusual, much-needed parenting book
When Melinda Wenner Moyer looked around in the autumn of 2018, she saw everywhere what she would describe as “assholes”. In the US and the UK, hate crime was – and is – rising. Across the world, #MeToo allegations continued to come. Donald Trump was in the White House and “I just felt like there was so much bad behaviour everywhere,” says Moyer. “I started thinking about my kids and worrying about ‘Who were they going to become?’ and ‘What were they learning from this behaviour?’ if they were seeing it on TV or hearing about it from their friends.” Moyer realised: “What I wanted more than anything else was for my kids to not grow up to be assholes.”
Moyer, a science journalist and parenting columnist, decided to go through the research and ended up writing a book with the pleasing title How to Raise Kids Who Aren’t Assholes. In the vast realm of parenting advice, there was plenty on diet, sleep and how to turn your child into a superhuman genius, but not a great deal on how to create a kind, compassionate person.

David LV Bauer is head of the RNA virus replication laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London

As a virologist, I’ve spent the past year or more studying the novel coronavirus that has upended all our lives. Communicating our work to the public and speaking to the media is an important part of my job, and I’ve always tried to be clear and accurate about the science: I believe the available vaccines against Covid-19 are safe, and they are our best route back to a more normal way of living.
I’ve been concerned about the anti-vaccination movement since before the pandemic. But I never imagined that my own work could actually be part of their misinformation arsenal. So I was shocked to discover that a recent TV interview I did for ITV London News had been seized on by anti-vax and conspiracy activists and now has thousands of likes, shares and retweets across social media.

Twenty livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany, Britain or France – and are receiving billions of dollars in financial backing to do so, according to a new report by environmental campaigners. 
Raising livestock contributes significantly to carbon emissions, with animal agriculture accounting for 14.5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific reports have found that rich countries need huge reductions in meat and dairy consumption to tackle the climate emergency.

The Galaxy Z Flip 3 replaces the original Z Flip (there was no version two) and costs £949 ($999/A$1,499) – £350 cheaper than its predecessor and on a par with the top smartphones, including Samsung’s £949 Galaxy S21+.

                    <span>Coal power has been the foundation for much of what Europe is today. But what has been the cost? Since 2016, half of the continent’s coal plants have closed, or are scheduled to close, as markets shift and the race to save the climate gathers speed. NGOs and grassroots organisations are working with communities to ensure the transition from coal is rapid, focused on renewables, and, most importantly, fair.
This increased attention on the people who have long lived with coal has revealed unsteadiness, illness and deep seams of injustice in communities across the continent. The photographer Dan Wilton joined the environmental law charity ClientEarth to investigate and document Europe’s journey beyond coal

                    <span>Last year, three cryptocurrency enthusiasts bought a cruise ship. They named it the Satoshi, and dreamed of starting a floating libertarian utopia. It didn’t work out
On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.
Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared.

The vehicle pulls over in a busy roundabout in central Mazar-e-Sharif, a city that until the Taliban takeover last month was known as the economic powerhouse of northern Afghanistan.
Now, it is a scene of desperation as Afghanistan’s economic crisis sends ordinary people like Yasemeen on to the street to sell their last possessions.

As well as one of the most alarming indications of the urgency of the climate crisis, the blazes have taken a huge toll on the men and women who are the frontline of defence against them. Firefighters work punishing hours for low pay, and frequently deal with depression, alcohol abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Health regulators in five countries are examining a prenatal test that collects the DNA of women and foetuses for research after it emerged the test’s manufacturer has links to China’s military.
Some doctors and clinics that promoted and sold the test, marketed under the brand name Nifty, said they were unaware that Shenzhen-based BGI Group also conducts research with the Chinese military.

International companies are being forced to reconsider their future in Hong Kong as China’s crackdown on civil liberties and the freedom of media and tech companies continues to gather pace, according to leading business figures in the region.
With businesses already facing restrictions because of the pandemic, the introduction of the national security law last year and the government shutdown of the pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper have sparked its biggest-ever exodus of people and rocked confidence in a city once synonymous with vibrant economic activity.

Brazil football great Pelé said on Monday that he was recovering in hospital from surgery to remove a tumour from his colon.
Pelé, the only player to win three World Cups, did not say whether the tumour was malignant but the 80-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player said he was feeling good.

Dirty air is the world’s biggest environmental killer, responsible for at least 4m early deaths a year. But just 1% of global development aid is used to tackle this crisis, according to an analysis from the Clean Air Fund (CAF).

Once considered simply a vital bodily function, coughing could be joining the list of unacceptably disruptive behaviours in theatres, along with excessive rustling, talking and using your mobile phone, as people have become more concerned about contagion risk due to Covid.
The change has been welcomed by BBC Proms host, Petroc Trelawny, who said one unexpected benefit of the pandemic that he has observed is that people no longer disturb performances in theatres by “coughing unnecessarily”.
In an interview with the Radio Times, Trelawny speculated that the stigma associated with potentially infecting others with Covid could mean that it will no longer be considered acceptable to cough in public, in a change that would be “particularly beneficial to music lovers”.

“Good times never seemed so good,” chanted Europe’s delirious players. You bet they didn’t. Just a second Solheim Cup win for those in blue and yellow on United States soil. This one arrived minus a travelling support. Take a bow, Catriona Matthew, who has captained her team in back-to-back triumphs.
Bare statistics belie the story of an exceptional day under the Toledo sun. This should be a watershed moment for women’s golf. What a pity that the Solheim shift to even years does not kick in until 2024. The standard of play at the Inverness Club was genuinely outstanding.

Two of the most senior figures in European football have attacked Fifa’s plans to reform the international calendar and implement a biennial World Cup, warning they risk diluting the game’s “jewel” and will put players’ health at risk.
Speaking at a meeting of the European Club Association in Geneva, Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, told representatives of more than 100 clubs: “You have probably heard that Fifa is conducting a feasibility study about the World Cup every two years. Well, we think that the jewel of the World Cup has value precisely because of its rarity. Holding it every two years will lead to less legitimacy, and it will unfortunately dilute the World Cup itself.

Hundreds of people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel, as several charities said the current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan showed why people risk their lives to flee.
It followed a first day of landings in more than two weeks on Sunday, after a run of bad weather put a halt to the crossings. A Home Office source said reports of 1,000 migrants entering the UK across the Channel in a single day is an exaggeration, and believed the figure will be between 800 and 850.

“Now they analyse everything in football,” laments Eric Cantona, genial, bearded and altogether more mellow than he was in his karate-kicking, sardine-citing 1990s Old Trafford pomp. “All I know is I can express myself. I don’t want to know more. It’s like in love – I don’t want to know why I love my wife.”
These wise words from the Manchester United talisman come during the first episode of Fever Pitch! The Rise of the Premier League (BBC Two), a new series devoted to precisely what he was indicting. As Cantona’s compatriot and fellow philosopher Marc Perelman argued in Barbaric Sport: A Global Plague, today the media are “all united to make sport inescapable, so that everyday conversation is bloated with invasive logorrhoeic blather”.

Raducanu faces Belinda Bencic in last eight

In the searing cauldron of the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the biggest tennis court on the planet, Emma Raducanu continued her astonishing three-week run from the empty US Open qualifying event towards the top tables of the sport by eviscerating yet another experienced top 50 opponent with a vital mixture of intelligence and consistency. In just 65 minutes, Raducanu defeated Shelby Rogers 6-2, 6-1 to reach her maiden grand slam quarter-final.
With her victory, Raducanu became just the third qualifier in the Open era to reach the US Open quarter-finals. Incredibly, after seven matches and three top 50 opponents, she has still not dropped any of her 14 sets. She arrived in the fourth round having lost fewer games than any other player and she has shown no sign of stopping.

The families of 298 people killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 have demanded justice from Russia as they testified in the Dutch trial of four suspects.
People who lost close relatives in the crash of the Malaysia Airlines plane said they could not truly say goodbye to their loved ones until those responsible had been brought to account.

Joe Biden’s administration is facing mounting pressure amid reports that several hundred people, including Americans, had been prevented for a week from flying out of an airport in northern Afghanistan.
Marina LeGree, the founder and executive director of a small American NGO active in Afghanistan, said 600 to 1,300 people, including girls from her group, had been waiting near the Mazar-i-Sharif airport for as long as a week amid confusion involving the Taliban and US officials.

The US justice department said that it will not tolerate violence against anyone seeking abortion services in the state and that federal officials are exploring all options to challenge the ban on almost all terminations, with new state law also empowering the public to enforce the law in a way critics decry as promoting vigilantism.

                    <span>London Wonderground, Earls Court, London
Jarred Christmas’s human cartoon antics and Hobbit’s virtuoso microphone skills jolly the crowd along – but the show wasn’t as interactive as billed
Some kids see a show with their parents then reflect eruditely, I imagine, on the shared experience. I have to parse my kids’ taciturnity for signs of enjoyment. After The Mighty Kids Beatbox Comedy Show at the London Wonderground, I coax “can I get a loop station for Christmas?” from my 11-year-old, which I take as high praise. (So too that she spent no small portion of the show videoing it on her phone.) My seven-year-old had beatboxed – if the noise he made might be so described – half the way to Earls Court, a have-a-go spirit I hoped he’d carry into what’s advertised as an interactive show.
In the event, he wasn’t given the chance – or at least, not in the manner promised. “Pick up beatboxing tips to impress your friends,” it says on the tin, but no such tips – nor any opportunity to have a go – were offered by comedian Jarred Christmas and UK loop station champion Hobbit. Instead, there’s a section on “knock, knock” jokes and their affinities with hip-hop – for which the kids present were invited to set their favourite examples to the Hobbit’s mouth-music. The finale asked volunteers to contribute sounds to a “song of the day” assembled on-the-hoof on Hobbit’s loop station. But Christmas instructed them which sounds to make (a cat – for example – enjoying itself on a rollercoaster, then being sick): this interactivity was strictly circumscribed.

Thousands of diehard Jair Bolsonaro followers have converged on Brazil’s political and economic capitals hoping to stage a colossal show of support for their beleaguered president amid mounting fears over the future of Brazilian democracy and of possible skirmishes with the government’s opponents.
The rightwing nationalist, who recently warned Brazil could face a political “rupture”, is expected to address packed independence day rallies in Brasília and São Paulo on Tuesday in what observers say is an increasingly weak politician’s attempt to project strength.

Spoiled for choice. On hearing that Boris Johnson was giving a Commons statement on Afghanistan, most MPs had been quick to spot the upside of being spared the ordeal of Dominic Raab again sounding baffled that Afghanistan fell under his brief in a statement of his own.
After all, during his two-hour session in front of the foreign affairs select committee last Wednesday, Dom had managed – in between blaming everyone else for his own failings – to make out as if it was a major imposition to be expected to do his job. Perhaps he still hasn’t come to terms with cutting short his hols. He even claimed he had simultaneously been completely prepared for the Taliban takeover and totally surprised by it. Schrödinger’s war.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Before the pandemic, the queues outside Café Istanbul in Manchester city centre would be out of the door. Eighteen months later, business is still quiet. “Even now, with people returning to the office, it is not like what it was before,” said Muzaffer Karanal, the head chef at one of the city’s oldest independent restaurants.
As pupils return to school and offices slowly reopen, most businesses around the city centre have not had the mass return of customers they were hoping for after Covid measures were lifted. Karanal is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will result in the return of packed lunchtimes during which his restaurant “never stopped”.

The first signs of a commuter revival in the capital appeared on Monday as London Underground recorded its busiest morning since the start of the pandemic – although schools may have played a bigger role than offices in increasing journeys.
Rush-hour trips on the tube were up 17% from last Tuesday, to just under a million – their highest since March 2020. Buses also saw 39% more passengers, according to Transport for London figures for the period to 10am on Friday.

                    <span>Gavin Williamson is a weak leader. But families and teachers have been let down by the government as a whole 
As English schools reopen for the autumn, relief and pleasure are mixed with apprehension and anger. Given the government’s shabby record on shepherding schools through the pandemic, it could be no other way. Even now, with a new term under way, confusion surrounds the question of whether younger teenagers are to be vaccinated. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, and his counterparts in the devolved administrations, are seeking advice from the chief medical officers, which could override last week’s decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to support a full rollout.
The catch-up budget for England, of £50 per year per pupil, is so small as to be an insult (by contrast, the Education Policy Institute pointed out, the US government has committed to spending an additional £1,600 per pupil, and the Netherlands £2,500). This decision led Sir Kevan Collins to resign as catch-up tsar four months after being appointed. Sir Kevan thought he had secured a commitment to a £15bn package, only to be offered £1.4bn instead.

                    <span>MPs have a choice – to fight for voting rights or fight against them
In a democracy, it is vital that elections are both secure and open to all. Voters must trust the result and know that it has not been fraudulently obtained. Polls suggest that they do: public confidence in elections is the highest for a decade. There is room for improvement. Steps, recommended by civil society and academics, could be taken to make party finance more transparent, beef up the power of the regulator and expand the franchise. Yet with its election bill, the second reading of which begins on Tuesday, the government has ignored such advice. Its proposals will damage democracy and make it easier to buy influence.
The government proposes to make the Electoral Commission subservient to the Speaker’s committee, a parliamentary body on which the Tories have a majority, and have the minister for the constitution keep a hand on its tiller. This appears vindictive revenge on the commission because it dared to do its job. The Tories cannot forgive the regulator for investigating Vote Leave or Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat refurbishment. Ministers want to rob the commission of the power to prosecute, knowing perhaps how reluctant police are to investigate political corruption. This will shield wrongdoing.

Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez and Emi Buendía and Tottenham’s Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso may face charges of misrepresentation if it is established that they submitted false information to Brazilian authorities about the places they had been to before entering the country.

                    <span>A new exhibition is correcting the record in Queensland, contrasting staged historical photography with the vibrant present
Travelling north through Cape York, you can’t miss the tiny town of Coen; the main road runs right through it. If Coen Heritage House was your only stop you’d learn a lot about the region’s mining, cattle and police history – it was home to “the biggest gold rush in tropical Australia” a sign declares – but little about Coen’s 300 or so primarily Indigenous residents.
Among framed photographs of the early pastoralists’ properties and portraits of their owners are photos of Kaantju woman Naomi Hobson’s great-grandfather, great-uncle and great-auntie. The images were returned to her community by the National Museum of Australia “to put up proudly on display”, says Hobson. “But it’s not who we are.”

                    <span>Historic move puts Anglican church in Wales at odds with Church of England, which forbids the practice
The Anglican church in Wales will offer special blessings to same-sex married couples after a historic vote welcomed by campaigners for equality.
The move puts the Welsh church at odds with the Church of England, which forbids clergy to bless same-sex marriages. It falls short of allowing same-sex marriages in church, and includes a “conscience clause”, allowing individual clergy to decide whether or not to offer blessings.

The first run was greeted like a divine blessing. The first boundary from Rory Burns was roared every inch of its way to the rope.

Robin Carpenter’s last win was Cascade Classic in 2017

Almost invariably the Tour of Britain follows a script written by the strongest teams. They decide which of the minnows is permitted to be in each day’s escape, to scrabble for the minor awards, and they decree when the escape is reined in before the big names do battle for the stage win. Very occasionally, however, a rider strikes a more than welcome blow for the smaller fry.

The comedian Phil Jerrod, known for his richly lyrical observations and tirades, delivered with surreal flights of fancy, has died from cancer aged 42. His agency, Off the Kerb, announced on Monday that Jerrod had died at home “with his devoted wife Beck by his side” and described him as “a dear friend to us, an incredibly kind and talented man”.
Tributes were paid on social media by standups including Dane Baptiste, who called him a “great comic” and “a good man with a kind soul”. Jacob Hawley said: “I frequently retell so many of the wise, supportive things he told me when I was a new act. Made every car journey/green room a happier place.” Sean McLoughlin said Jerrod was “spectacularly talented, cool and probably the nicest person in the business. We should all aim to be more like him.”

The UK’s vaccine advisory group behaved like a medical regulator in rejecting calls for all children aged 12-15 to be offered Covid jabs despite that not being its role, Prof Neil Ferguson has said.
Last week the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the margin of benefit for older children, on health grounds alone, was too small for the committee to support jabs for the entire age group.

The NHS will get more money over the next three years than the Treasury had planned after last-ditch lobbying for a bigger budget by the health and social care secretary, Sajid Javid.
Whitehall sources said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had been persuaded to increase the funding he intended to hand the NHS by at least £1bn, taking the expected rise from £5bn to at least £6bn a year.

As Leylah Annie Fernandez basked in the joy of her improbable third round comeback win over Naomi Osaka earlier last week, she was asked on the court in her post-match interview at what point she truly believed that she could topple such a champion. Her response was immediate. “From the very beginning,” Fernandez said. The crowd reacted with a surprised murmur. “Right before the match, I knew I was able to win.”
Against Osaka, Fernandez had trailed 7-5, 6-5 as the third seed served for a straight-sets win. Two days later, Angelique Kerber led their contest 6-4, *4-3 and appeared to have taken the upper hand in a tight tussle. Both times that Fernandez found herself at the cliff edge, she elevated her level and recovered her footing to win.

GP surgery staff are facing abuse from patients who are “angry and upset” that their blood test has been cancelled because of the NHS-wide chronic shortage of sample bottles.
“Patients are angry when we ring them up and say, ‘Sorry we can’t do your blood test after all’. A lot of people are quite angry and concerned about their own health,” Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of council at the British Medical Association, said.

                    <span>Readers give their views on the funding of social care and the contribution they have made
Can someone tell me why the narrative around the raising of national insurance and income tax constantly alludes to the importance of pensioners paying their fair share (Raising national insurance to fund social care is fraught with political risk, 3 September)? I started my working life in the 1970s, when the average tax for low- and middle-income earners was 40%-50%. This compares with the 20% currently being paid. My generation paid this high rate gladly, on the assumption that we were investing in a health and welfare system that would protect us from birth to grave. All of us pensioners deserve every penny we are receiving, as we have paid our fair share.
Surely, the focus of our egalitarian concerns should be the top earners whose tax has dropped from 75%/83% in the 70s to 45%. This has arguably lead to the discrepancy in wealth distribution, and a struggling health and welfare service.

                    <span>A culture of increasing profit by reducing costs, with frontline workers paying the price, has led to the crisis in road transport, says Richard Simpson 
As a former editor of Trucking magazine, I can only say that the shortage of truck drivers has been a long time coming (HGV driver shortages could ‘cancel’ Christmas, warns Iceland boss, 25 August). Road transport shares with the social care industry an enduring culture of increasing profit by reducing costs, with frontline workers paying the price. Both transport and care are now dominated by agencies, which seem to do little for the pounds of flesh that they extract from staff and clients. Unsurprisingly, people prefer to earn a living in other ways.
There are about 600,000 people holding LGV cat C (rigid truck) or cat C+E (articulated lorry) licences in the UK who do not currently drive trucks for a living. Why would they want to return to the job? Facilities are poor, the hours brutal and the responsibilities onerous. And these are only going to get worse. The latest changes to the highway code appear to make truck drivers entirely responsible for the stupidity of childish “vulnerable road users” who are now being encouraged to treat the road as a playground while “adult” drivers look after them. A rethink is needed.

The exhibition, now in its 70th year, is the second oldest of its kind. After the Venice Biennale, it is regarded as one of the most important events in the art world calendar.

The most interesting intervention in the hot debate over skills shortages came last week from Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, who, as a pro-Brexit businessman, might be expected to have a sliver of sympathy for the government’s apparent view that companies should stop whinging and train British workers to address strains in supply chains.
In fact, Wolfson’s sympathy was less than zero. “It strikes me as being insane that, despite the fact that everyone knows that we desperately need drivers, the Home Office is still preventing people coming to this country to work as drivers,” he said.

                    <span>Number of species of sharks, rays and chimaeras facing ‘global extinction crisis’ doubles in a decade
A third of shark and ray species have been overfished to near extinction, according to an eight-year scientific study.
“Sharks and rays are the canary in the coalmine of overfishing. If I tell you that three-quarters of tropical and subtropical coastal species are threatened, just imagine a David Attenborough series with 75% of its predators gone. If sharks are declining, there’s a serious problem with fishing,” said the paper’s lead author, Prof Nicholas Dulvy, of Canada’s Simon Fraser University.

Name: The wallet.
Age: So the word has been around since the 14th century, but it used to refer to a small sack for carrying provisions. The introduction of paper money to the west in the 1600s led to the development of wallets for the way we use them today. Wallets that look like wallets really came about in the 1950s.

The spectacle of the Tory party in a frothing fury is a stirring one. Ministers brief freely – Jacob Rees-Mogg’s head high above the parapet – while every WhatsApp groupuscule of Conservative MPs rampages against raising national insurance to fund social care and the NHS.
It’s hard to find a loyal voice, beyond the ministerial payroll dutifully sent into TV studios to be knocked about. The angries storm at the prospect of breaking manifesto promises – not to raise the three main taxes and not to break the pension triple lock (though their hunting horns were strangely muted over the broken promise not to cut foreign aid).

                    <span>Every morning, he delivers the German poll ratings to me. It has become clear that – apart from a zoo full of bonobos – nothing would make him happier than a win for the Social Democratic party
The German elections fall on Mr Z’s birthday, and he’s decided that, as a gift to him, he would like the SPD to win. Neither of us knows a huge amount about German politics. I have some pretty good intel, from a podcast I made, that everyone standing is deeply disappointing, and nobody should win. My Mr, by contrast, has decided that Olaf Scholz represents real change. Every morning, he delivers the poll ratings. The party has gone from being 20 points behind to five points ahead. It is impossible to guess why this makes him so happy. I floated the idea that maybe he was divining some parallel uptick in Labour’s fortunes. But he said no, he just really wants to see the Social Democratic party surge to victory. From the heavy significance of his voice and eyebrows, I managed to pick up that it is my responsibility to deliver on this. “I’m not saying it’s impossible,” I said – I am, after all, totally abreast of the polls. “I’m just saying it’s impossible for me to make this happen.” “Don’t worry,” he said. “There’s something else I want.”
The other thing he urgently wants is to see a zoo full of bonobos. There are only two, one in Antwerp and one in Twycross, and he’s prepared to compromise and stay local, but he’s not prepared to budge on the teenagers, who must accompany us and be in a good mood about it. He thinks I can make this fly by describing the matrilineal society of bonobos, and how well they model the community ideal, of pure pleasure and cooperation, when the females are in charge. I counter that we could also model this ideal, put me in charge, I’d leave the kids at home, and we could enjoy the zoo, just the two of us, and that would be a Perfect Day. He said that was droll, but it wasn’t what he wanted, and it was his birthday.

Researchers examined the economic cost of the climate crisis and found it would cut about 37% from global GDP this century, more than twice the drop experienced in the Great Depression.

Nicolas Gentile, a 37-year-old Italian pastry chef, did not just want to pretend to be a hobbit – he wanted to live like one. First, he bought a piece of land in the countryside of Bucchianico, near the town of Chieti in Abruzzo, where he and his wife started building their personal Shire from JRR Tolkien’s fictional Middle-earth.
Then, on 27 August, alongside a group of friends and Lord of the Rings fans dressed as an elf, a dwarf, a hobbit, a sorcerer and humans, he walked more than 120 miles (200km) from Chieti to Naples, crossing mountains and rivers, to throw the “One Ring”, a central plot element of The Lord of the Rings saga, into the volcano crater of Mount Vesuvius.

Jean-Paul Belmondo, star of Breathless, dies aged 88
A life in pictures

On the streets of Paris, car thief and fugitive cop killer Michel Poiccard has just been gunned down by the police, having shown an insolent, fatalistic attitude to the idea of getting caught, and indeed to the revelation that his American girlfriend Patricia, wannabe journalist and street vendor of the New York Herald Tribune, has ratted him out. She leans over Michel as he lies dying in a puddle of blood. Will Michel come up with some resonant last words? Not exactly. Defying agony from his bullet wounds, he just clownishly stretches his face into the two silly expressions he’d earlier used to explain the phrase “faire la tête”: a goofy silent scream, then a panto grin. Isn’t this what acting is, what life is: tragedy, comedy, faces, speeches? Who cares?
This unforgettably bizarre, throwaway gesture – the equal of “Here’s looking at you, kid” from Michel’s beloved Bogart – set the seal on Jean-Paul Belmondo’s sensational breakthrough in 1960 in Jean-Luc Godard’s equally legendary debut, À Bout de Souffle (AKA Breathless), from a treatment by François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol, and co-starring Jean Seberg as the American mesmerised by his erotic, existential bravado.

Jean-Paul Belmondo: the beaten-up icon who made crime sexy
A life in pictures

Jean-Paul Belmondo, the French actor who shot to international fame in Jean-Luc Godard’s revolutionary new wave classic Breathless, has died aged 88. The actor’s lawyer confirmed the news to AFP.
Belmondo – nicknamed Bébel by French audiences – became one of the country’s biggest box-office stars in the 60s and 70s, his battered-looking face a contrast to the chiselled features of his rival and sometime-collaborator Alain Delon. Like Delon, Belmondo was a key figure of the outstanding generation of European film-making of the period, with the series of films he made with Godard – which included A Woman Is a Woman and Pierrot le Fou – making an indelible mark.

                    <span>The beauty and lifestyle guru is now hosting a Hillary Clinton-produced talkshow. She talks about her rise to online fame, keeping her private life private, and her fear of going broke

“I learned how women delivered babies from watching YouTube videos. So I had to give back. I had to share.” Patricia Bright is chatting to me by Zoom from her home in south London. Behind her is the garden office that her almost 3 million subscribers will recognise as the studio where she does her filming. We’re discussing her birthing vlogs, among them My Unexpected Labour and Delivery Story, one of which was filmed in the hallway metres from where she is sitting.
Bright is a YouTube sensation – a beauty, fashion and lifestyle guru who began making videos more than 10 years ago while working in the City, long before the phrase, “Hi, guys, welcome back to my channel,” was used ironically. She is celebrated as one the first black British YouTube to gain 1 million subscribers, but the 34-year-old’s true skill is building an empire from being a proud oversharer with a dry sense of humour and an infectious personality. She feels like your best friend or your auntie, depending on which you need. She also has no qualms in acknowledging that – as with midwifery – she may not be the most qualified person in every area she covers. “I’m not a hairdresser, I’m not a makeup artist, I’m not a fashion expert, and I’m not a financial expert.” She adds, however, with the confidence of a YouTube veteran: “If you want to create content in that area, you can do that. The platforms allow us to do it.”

                    <span>We know from Iraq that those with responsibility for 20 years of strategic disaster won’t actually be held responsible
On the morning of 14 March 1757, one of the Royal Navy’s most senior serving admirals, John Byng, was marched on to the deck of the warship HMS Monarch, forced to kneel and shot by a firing squad of marines. At the time, during the Seven Years’ War, the execution divided the establishment and the country. But he had failed “to do his utmost” to comply with his instructions to take the island of Minorca in the Mediterranean, and during a global war that was not good enough.

                    <span>It may be the first Marvel film not to be approved in mainland China, but its American Chinese heritage hero and strong female representation are badass
This time last year I was disheartened by the troubling ways that Disney’s live-action Mulan collaborated with the Chinese government to squander a golden opportunity to adapt the animated film, going so far as to alter its screenplay to placate state censors and shoot the film in Xinjiang, in the same area as Uyghur detention camps.
So I had few expectations of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, other than the casting of Hong Kong legend Tony Leung Chiu-Wai in his first Hollywood role, as Xu Wenwu the corruptible-though-redeemable crime lord and grieving father of protagonist Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). It was therefore a satisfying prove-me-wrong moment to watch the film in a cinema filled with an audience who whooped at every meticulously choreographed levitating kick, punch and tai chi-inspired fight sequence. I left with hope and elation, not disappointment.

It was the big Brexit lie. No, not the £350m a week to spend on the NHS or the “bonfire” of red tape. The lie was that the shambles now enveloping British trade with Europe was an unavoidable price worth paying to leave the EU. That was rubbish.
In order to further his chances of becoming Tory leader Boris Johnson made two commitments. One was to resign from the EU, the other was to depart Europe’s customs union and single market, aspects of which embrace other non-EU states such as Norway. The second decision was an almost casual gesture to make him look macho to the party’s hardline Brexiters. It was not put to referendum and was beyond stupid.

I was dating a guy I shouldn’t have been going out with in the first place: he was older, he wanted to get married and all these things, but he didn’t ask me, he just decided. Back then, I was so meek and mild. My friends would say: “Your boyfriend is so controlling. You have to stick up for yourself.”

Downing Street signalled its intention to renew the Coronavirus Act later this autumn, although some temporary powers may be allowed to expire.

The group posted pictures on social media showing Taliban fighters standing in front of the gate of the governor’s compound. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement, saying Panjshir was under the control of Taliban fighters.

Fideos are wafer-thin string noodles that, along with capers, were brought over to Mexico by the Spanish from Sicily, an island they also occupied for a few hundred years. The result was sopa seca (literally meaning dry soup), a fantastically flavoured pasta dish from Veracruz, in which the noodles are sauteed until brown, then simmered in a rich tomato sauce spiked with smoky chipotle relish, plus fresh crab meat, a scattering of capers and fresh lime.

If you were one of the lucky ones during the lockdowns – healthy, in employment, furloughed or working from home, with no young children – you may have seized on the spare time to knock out a novel or two, master clog dancing or embark on a lifesize sculpture of Prof Chris Whitty. A survey by the Open University found that 61% of people took up something creative in 2020 – nearly a third reported reading for pleasure, with cooking close behind, while crafts such as knitting and photography were also embraced. It also reported a 622% increase in registrations for online creative courses, while Pinterest had a 130% increase in viewings of sewing videos. Now, as life starts to get busier, how do we keep our newfound creative practice alive?

India was working for the police force in St Augustine, Florida, in February 2019, when she visited an accountancy firm during one of her routine patrols. “I was going around the local businesses to introduce myself,” she says. Building those relationships is common in the US, to help prevent crimes such as break-ins and trespassing in small towns. “I hand out cards so that people can contact me if they need me.” When she walked into the accountancy firm, she met the owner, Todd, and was struck by how handsome he was.
He asked if they could take a selfie together. “I was friends with the police chief,” he says. “I wanted to send him this picture to show she was doing great community outreach. She was a bit embarrassed when I took it.”

California is facing a drought so devastating, some publications call it “biblical”. Colorado now has “fire years” instead of “fire seasons”. Miami, which sees more dramatic hurricanes each year, is contemplating building a huge seawall in one of the city’s most scenic tourist districts to protect it from storm surges.
“Once you learn how damaged the world’s ecosystems are, it’s not really something you can unsee,” says Rachel Larrivee, 23, a sustainability consultant based in Boston. “To me, there’s no point in pursuing a career – or life for that matter – in any other area.”

While some lenders such as NatWest are demonstrating leadership on specific issues – such as net zero targets and policies restricting financing for new fossil fuel – research by investment campaign group ShareAction found none of the banks it reviewed were taking action across all key areas.

                    <span>Addiction to pornography has been blamed for erectile dysfunction, relationship issues and depression, yet problematic use is rising. Now therapists and tech companies are offering new solutions
Thomas discovered pornography in the traditional way: at school. He remembers classmates talking about it in the playground and showing each other videos on their phones during sleepovers. He was 13 and thought it was “a laugh”. Then he began watching pornography alone on his tablet in his room. What started as occasional use, at the beginning of puberty, became a daily habit.
Thomas (not his real name), who is in his early 20s, lived with one of his parents, who he says did not care what he was doing online. “At the time, it felt normal, but looking back I can see that it got out of hand quite quickly,” Thomas says. When he got a girlfriend at 16, he started having sex and watched less pornography. But the addiction was just waiting to resurface, he says.

In May, Canadians were shocked at the discovery of the remains of 215 children at the site of a former school in British Columbia. The bodies belonged to Indigenous children, some believed to be as young as three years old, who went through Canada’s state-sponsored “residential school” system. The schools, scattered across the country, were aimed at eradicating the culture and languages of the country’s Indigenous populations.
The findings have brought the world’s renewed attention to this shameful chapter of Canadian history, left deep wounds in hundreds of communities and sparked fresh demands for justice aimed at the Canadian government and the churches that ran the schools for decades.

There is a strong argument that the British politician whose reputation has been most enhanced by the challenges of the past 18 months is Mark Drakeford.
Despite having played a prominent role in devolved Welsh politics for almost two decades before that, at the time of his elevation to the role of Welsh Labour leader and first minister in December 2018, this unassuming west Walian remained largely unknown to the public. Even a year later, the low profile accorded to him in his party’s 2019 general election campaign suggests he was not regarded as an electoral asset.

Someone’s Daughter, curated by Jennie Ricketts and presented with The View magazine, is a new photography exhibition highlighting how female prisoners are seen and understood, with the ultimate aim of reimagining the justice system. The show is appearing at Photo London alongside an online benefit auction hosted by Artsy.
By photographing women who have been stigmatised by the law, the courts and the media in the administration of justice, and displaying them alongside professionals working in the criminal justice space, the exhibition seeks to change how formerly incarcerated women are perceived and ultimately the way justice is served.

                    <span>The 25-year-old politician talks about taking time off to address her mental health, dropping out of university because of the cost – and why she’ll always give away a large part of her salary
Nadia Whittome originally made headlines when she became the “baby of the house” in 2019, elected at the age of 23 as Labour MP for Nottingham East, in an election whose main take-home was how many seats Labour had lost. She was a firebrand or maverick – insert your favourite term for “disobedient” – from the start: hard-remain when Corbyn’s office was all about the lexiters, further to the left than Starmer has turned out to be (so far).
So she was never going to be a quiet backbencher, working her way strategically through the party ranks, but her next headlines were a long way from politics. In May this year, she announced her decision to take time off because of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a parliamentary culture in which even MPs who have to give birth or have chemotherapy are surrounded by endless discussion about whether they can still do their job, this was a momentous act, signalling to many that Whittome belonged to a new, more honest culture. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said at the time that her colleague had “shown so much bravery and … will have helped so many other people”, a view shared by many Conservatives. But Whittome wasn’t thinking of the career angle. “My symptoms were getting worse rather than better. I couldn’t be the energetic, effective MP that Nottingham needs and deserves, and, also for my own health, I needed time and space to recover. I didn’t worry about my political future, I wasn’t thinking about that at all.”

On 15 May, at 1.35pm, an officer of the Israeli military called Tarek Mahdi, whose family owned and lived in Gaza’s 15-floor al-Jalaa tower, along with many others. The officer said that the building would soon be hit by an airstrike. The residents and workers there had one hour to get out.
At that moment, a race began to alert residents and try to get them all out. The destruction of the building – which had about 60 flats as well as offices of Al Jazeera and Associated Press, but which Israel claimed was also used by Hamas for “electronic warfare” to disrupt its air force – became one of the indelible images of the 11-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in May this year. Anas Baba tells Michael Safi the story of the people who lived there in the last hour before their homes were levelled – as pieced together through interviews and recordings they shared of their frantic attempts to get everybody out in time.

Europe’s captain: ‘I am delighted to be going in with a lead’

The tense, tremendous, Toledo tussle. Those who feared a Solheim Cup which may struggle for attention due to it clashing in part with the extravagant conclusion to the PGA Tour season need not have worried. The only pity associated with this gripping battle between the teams of the United States and Europe is that only one more chapter remains.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The footballer Marcus Rashford has urged the government to end threats to social security payments and focus instead on practical measures to address what he called the pandemic of child hunger affecting the UK.
Rashford’s call accompanied new figures which estimate that nearly one in six families with children experienced food insecurity during the past six months, meaning they skipped meals or struggled to afford to eat healthy food regularly.

“This is a sushi conveyor belt,” says the boat’s skipper, Stuart Barnes, as we watch the customers, dozens of harbour seals slumbering on sandbanks at the mouth of the Thames estuary, a 15-minute ride from Ramsgate marina.
August is moulting season, when seals shed their coats and grow new ones, spending much of their day on the sandbanks as a result. This makes it a good time for scientists to count them, with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) running its three-day annual seal survey, using boats and a specially chartered light aircraft to get a view from above.

The immersive theatre company Punchdrunk, celebrated for creating labyrinthine adventures in atmospheric locations, is to undertake its costliest and most ambitious project to date with a “future noir” retelling of the fall of Troy.
The Burnt City will be staged in cavernous buildings at the company’s new headquarters at Woolwich Works, a creative hub in the historic site of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London. Some 600 theatregoers at a time will be given free rein to walk around the contrasting ancient worlds of Troy and Mycenae, each given a dystopian sci-fi spin, where they will encounter gods, monsters and perhaps a secret passageway or two over a three-hour evening.

Wagamama struggling to find chefs at a fifth of its UK sites

The labour crisis could last for up to two years, Britain’s leading business lobby group has warned, as it called for ministers to take action on visas for foreign workers and stop “waiting for shortages to solve themselves”.
Amid the most severe labour crunch since the 1970s, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) launched a broadside against the government, saying the UK’s economic recovery from the winter lockdown was being undermined by a lack of skills in key positions, with mounting risks that the problem would continue for some time.

The findings show that working in an office is not necessarily safe and that working from home may be better to protect people’s health, said Dr Christopher Huntley.

The existing 10-year limit on the length of time those planning to use in-vitro fertilisation can store the genetic materials needed is being scrapped, the government said on Monday.

A World Cup qualifier between Argentina and Brazil was abandoned amid farcical, confused scenes after four Premier League players apparently violated Brazilian regulations designed to contain a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 580,000 Brazilians.
The Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez and Tottenham’s Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso were all on the pitch at São Paulo’s Neo Química Arena on Sunday afternoon when federal police and officials from Brazil’s health agency, Anvisa, took to the field to halt play after just seven minutes.

As some families in Greenville, California started to return home this week after the Dixie fire tore through this town of about 800 residents, they were confronted by burnt remnants of their former lives. Some returned to find a makeshift grave for a family pet. Others walked through debris which, just a few weeks earlier, they had planned to sell.
Photographer Josh Edelson was at home, recuperating from a stretch of 20-hour days photographing the California wildfires, when he saw the alert from CalFire, the state’s department of forestry and fire protection, saying this week that residents could return home. The news came one month after the Dixie fire – which has burned 893,852 acres since erupting on 14 July – struck Greenville, and Edelson wanted to capture the moment.

As her US Open fourth round contest against Elina Svitolina fell further and further from her grasp, Simona Halep’s frustration was increasingly clear to see. She seethed endlessly towards her team, she tossed her racket multiple times and her frustration was written all over her face.
Across the net, however, there was nothing. No negative emotion whatsoever. Even when she faltered, Svitolina immediately shrugged the frustration off, her gameface firmly on. The only time she interacted with her team was to share positive pumped fists and knowing stares.

Baker, who is wanted by police for alleged crimes including murder, piracy and robbery, has been on the run from police since 2013. He has twice escaped jail – one time by faking a knee injury and fleeing while he was being taken for medical treatment.

Iranian-American director Ana Lily Amirpour serves up heaped spoonfuls of B-movie thrills in Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon, in which a supernatural teen wanders wild in New Orleans. If the film is finally more moony than masterpiece, it does more than enough to keep her fanbase onside. Amirpour’s first film, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, was a vampire western; her second, The Bad Batch, a cannibal romance. On the menu this time: superhero gumbo. Grab a bowl and tuck in. Whatever you do, don’t look in the waitress’s eyes.
Jeon Jong-seo stars as Mona Lisa Lee, who exerts a form of hypnotic mind control that can make her enemies slap themselves, stab themselves or put a bullet in their own knees. She’s just busted out of the “Home For Mentally Insane Adolescents” where she’s been held for ten years, and now has to make sense of the world as she goes along. Seat belts are a puzzle and money is a foreign language. In one scene we see Mona gazing in abject mystification at an image of Donald Trump on TV – and this at least suggests that the girl is learning fast.

Plans to raise national insurance contributions to increase funding for the NHS and to overhaul social care have been privately criticised by cabinet ministers – and MPs have told the chief whip they could oppose the measures in the Commons.

                    <span>Fourth Test, day four: India 191 &amp; 466; England 77-0, need 291 more to win
England’s attack given torrid time by India middle-order

As the shadows lengthened on the fourth evening, eventually engulfing the outfield at the Oval to end a day of glorious sunshine, England’s opening pair of Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed made an encouraging start to what is a tilt at history.
A dispiriting performance in the field from Joe Root’s side had let India put 466 all out on the board just after tea and, with this, a target of 368 in four sessions had been set. It will be England’s all-time record run chase if achieved, surpassing the 359 that Ben Stokes raided against Australia at Headingley two years ago, and by reaching 77 for no loss by the close, thoughts of another miracle lingered.

                    <span>As a competitive spectacle, this was predictably lacking. Andorra have made steps forward over the past five years or so but mainly in terms of restricting the number of hammerings they have suffered. All they wanted to do here was keep the scoreline down and they barely crossed the halfway line.
Yet as a spectacle itself, there was plenty to enjoy. England’s first return to Wembley since the penalty shootout loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final was marked by a fun atmosphere and the continued feeling that this is a team that people can get behind.

Nils Eekhoff of Team DSM takes second place in Cornwall

Bodmin, Paris and Tokyo have shared at least one experience this summer: the Wout van Aert juggernaut has rolled into town and made a lasting impression. Six weeks after taking the Olympic silver medal in the Olympic road race in Tokyo, and seven after taking the final stage of the Tour de France on the Champs-Élysées, the Belgian national champion made straightforward work of winning stage one of the Tour of Britain to take the initial race lead. His post-Olympic break has clearly not affected his appetite or dulled his finishing speed.
Van Aert’s last five races have produced three wins – he also took the Tour’s penultimate stage, a time trial – that Olympic medal, and sixth place in the Olympic time trial. He currently sits on nine victories for the year, but few would bet against him adding at least one or two more before the British Tour hits Aberdeen next Sunday. And with a fair wind, he will start as favourite to win the world championship in his native Belgium towards the end of the month.

I took some old, blunt kitchen knives to a second-hand shop a few months ago while decluttering. They politely declined the items, citing their policy against selling anything that could be used as a weapon.
This shop’s policy now seems prescient. On a sunny spring afternoon, while West Auckland shoppers took pains to protect themselves against the coronavirus in a locked-down city, a terribly visible threat grabbed some sharp steel from the shelves, ran screaming down the aisles, and started stabbing random shoppers in the name of an invisible cloud of hate, alienation, radicalisation, distrust, anger, violence.

                    <span>Actor Jack O’Connell is known for going to physical extremes to show the vulnerability of violent men. But what does masculinity really mean to him?
Are you here to see man?” asks a Spanish waiter as I walk through the café garden, and points towards the table just beyond the loos where Jack O’Connell stands, his hand raised in a solemn hello. Yes I say. Yes I am.
To sit in the dark and watch Jack O’Connell’s work, from the very earliest characters he played (a boy accused of rape in The Bill, Pukey the skinhead in This Is England) through to self-destructive lad Cook in teen drama Skins and the boy incarcerated with his dad in prison drama Starred Up, followed by a squaddie in Northern Ireland in the Troubles film ’71, is to watch a slow portrait of contemporary masculinity. What O’Connell does, with his eyes and voice, and careful violence, is show the vulnerability beneath his characters’ cracked shells, and I’m keen now to find out how much of them is him, and how much of him is them, and what he’s learned about masculinity.

The modern mind is a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their work

“I want to be a good mother but I’m afraid. I didn’t have a good childhood.”
The nurse held back tears as she told me what the patient had told her. Involuntarily, I felt the prick of tears too, at her horror and the patient’s, conveyed in the recollection. It wasn’t that the abuse was violent or at a very young age. The betrayal of a child’s trust is hard to hear. The patient’s mother, herself neglected and vulnerable in childhood, had been largely unavailable, sometimes frightening, and immersed in her own addictions; her stepfather, the gentler parent, was also a substance user and had abused her, even as she tried to support him, so he could provide care for her.

The light from the red bulb is flattering – I’ve been told to eliminate all blue light on my nocturnal trek – but the sleep-tracker headband, currently emitting the sound of gently lapping waves, kills any woke-up-like-this vibe.

As a working mother, one word has saved me as the pandemic has worn on: “No.” I’ve learned to say no to being the parent who will automatically take carer’s leave when childcare centres and schools close. No to being the only one to plan meals for the week. No to being the type of Instagram-worthy mother who mindfully makes her own hummus throughout lockdown.
Mastering the word has been liberating. It has freed up time, energy and headspace to do my paid work, focus on self-care essentials and actually enjoy free time with my family. It’s also supported a positive relationship with my partner because we both equally pull our weight at home, heading off the resentment that can fester in some relationships when the unequal division of labour takes its toll.

                    <span>For too many, the government encroaches upon their lives but cannot protect them
In his treatise Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes did not suggest that government was benevolent – only necessary. Without it, argued the philosopher, people would live in perpetual fear in “a war of all against all” and life would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”. His argument’s urgency reflected its context – the English civil war. But it recognised that the state had to be justified by a degree of consent from those it ruled.
The Nigerian government has a democratic mandate. Though President Muhammadu Buhari was once a dictator, his return to power in 2015 was the country’s first transition between democratically elected leaders. Voters chose him to tackle corruption and curb Boko Haram’s violence. But the state’s ability to carry out its most basic function, providing the basic physical security of which Hobbes wrote, is crumbling by the day. For too many Nigerians, the government is a force that encroaches on or plunders their lives without offering protection, let alone support. Unemployment is among the world’s worst, the cost of living is rising, the pandemic’s impact has deepened frustration and an oil price slump hurt the petro-dependent economy; all threaten to worsen widespread violence.

                    <span>Plantations are no replacement for biodiverse forests that have evolved over thousands of years
People need trees. A world without ilex, cinnamon and rosewood trees, a world devoid of magnolias, hornbeams and maples would be much the poorer. We rely on trees, of course, to absorb and store carbon dioxide. They provide us with food, fuel, medicine and construction materials. They shelter us from storms; they reduce soil erosion. Without them, other plants and animals would be lost for ever – in the UK, native oaks feed and shelter about 2,300 other species. We are only beginning to fully comprehend their social nature and the “wood wide web” which connects plants together through roots, fungi and bacteria. We need them, too, because their grace and beauty lift our spirits and restore our calm. 
There are almost 58,500 tree species in the world, a richness few of us can truly comprehend. But a shocking new international study has warned that between a third and half of those are at risk of extinction in the wild – posing a risk of wider ecosystem collapse. The comprehensive report by Botanic Gardens Conservation International, which was five years in the making, found that twice as many tree species are threatened as mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles combined.

The theme of the closing ceremony of the Paralympics was “Harmonious Cacophony”. It’s the sort of phrase you might find on a T-shirt in Tokyo’s bustling Harajuku district, one that is just about in English but doesn’t quite feel like it.
In the bowl of Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium on Sunday night, it all made sense. Bright discordant lights, loud technicolour music (including some from a man with a prosthetic synthesiser arm), they all came together in a manner that was stirring. There was also a gaudy papier-mache city being assembled at the same time; although, to be fair, that bit was confusing throughout.

It’s both an income tax and an employment tax; it’s regressive; it’s not paid by those above the state pension age; it incentivises the construction of imaginative subcontractor avoidance schemes; and it requires its own collection and recording scheme.
Why not, in the name of efficiency and fairness, abandon NI and replace it with simpler taxes on income and profit? This would ensure that those with the broadest shoulders bear the greatest burden (since income tax is progressive). It would widen the tax base – income, whether through work or a pension, becomes liable for tax, independent of the age of the recipient, and employers become subject to tax by reference to the profits they earn, rather than a headcount of employees. Of course, headline rates of income tax will jump, but the resulting tax would be more fairly spread across all taxpayers (particularly because replacing a regressive with a progressive tax ensures the less well-off pay less).

                    <span>Watford’s mayor, Peter Taylor, on why the West Hertfordshire trust’s proposed development is well planned and urgently needed
After reading Philip Aylett’s letter about plans by the West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust to build a new hospital in Watford (31 August), I felt it only right to stand up for the trust’s well-considered and long-thought-through decision. After an extensive independent feasibility study looking at six potential sites, it was clear that the Watford option was the fastest route to getting desperately needed new facilities to serve patients across west Hertfordshire.
The trust’s senior clinicians have devised plans for services to be provided across three local hospitals, with Watford remaining the centre for emergency and specialist care services. These plans, and the availability of land at the Watford site, mean that this is by far the best option, with no need to purchase huge parcels of land or navigate the more complex planning legislation around building on greenfield. This means it is possible to deliver brand new health facilities far sooner.

After a treacherous journey to the airport, he was evacuated to the UK last week but is not sure what the future holds. “I’m relieved to be here but I lost a lot of things. I lost my job, my position, everything. It’s painful for me,” he said from the hotel room in central London, where he is in quarantine. “I had a very good position inside Afghanistan but in the UK, it’s so difficult to find a job here.”

More than 8,700 British chain stores closed in the first half of 2021 as a combination of the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to online shopping continued to hit demand for bricks-and-mortar retail, new analysis has shown.
The number of chain shop closures far outpaced the number of new openings, meaning that overall numbers fell by 5,251, according to the Local Data Company, a research firm. Fashion shops were by far the worst-affected category.

MPs face ‘phenomenal’ rise in constituent casework during pandemic

As soon as the pandemic began the casework just exploded. We were receiving more than 600 emails a day, some of which were petitions or chain letters, but hundreds were from people in immediate, desperate need.
I’ve worked for an MP for 25 years and the workload has never been this crazy. In January 2016, we dealt with 40 pieces of casework. In January this year we dealt with 1,025. We’re now up to 4,639 cases so far this year, with a backlog of nearly 2,000 emails. We’re all absolutely knackered. We have two full-time caseworkers and one part-time researcher. Overnight we had to become experts in new areas: one of us focused on helping people with their finances while a colleague helped repatriate constituents from overseas.

‘We’re all absolutely knackered’ says MP’s office manager

MPs and their staff are buckling under the strain of a “phenomenal” rise in appeals for help from constituents, with some reporting a 12-fold increase in casework fuelled in part by an “absolute crisis” in mental health issues.
Parliamentary aides said they were becoming burnt out and struggling to help people in desperate need, because of a “massive backlog” of issues caused by the Covid pandemic.

An elite national army unit has announced it has seized power in Guinea and deposed the country’s president, Alpha Condé, in an attempted coup, after heavy gunfire was heard near the presidential palace in the capital, Conakry, on Sunday morning.
Soldiers announced the country’s leadership had been deposed in the latest political upheaval to beset the mineral-rich and impoverished west African country, amid conflicting claims of who was in power.

The Dutch lion roared in front of a home crowd at Zandvoort that had come for a party and Verstappen proved a munificent host. Retaking the lead in the title fight by beating Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton into second was his reward in this tightly fought season that continues to ebb and flow.

Wales did it the hard way – two disastrous first-half minutes saw them trail at the break – but Bale struck in second-half stoppage time to kill off a stubborn Belarus side that fell to the floor as the ball squeezed in beyond goalkeeper Sergei Chernik.

Few memorials require restoration before they are complete, but that is the reality facing the bereaved who care for the national Covid memorial wall opposite the Houses of Parliament in London.
Armed with pots of crimson masonry paint, they have started refreshing the wall of more than 150,000 hearts, many of which are already fading in the sun and rain. They also have the sad task of adding 5,000 more, to catch up with the still-rising death toll. Like the pandemic, there is no end in sight. But soon, sections could be preserved using a specialist lacquer that has previously been deployed to protect street art by Banksy to create a memorial that could stand for years to come.

                    <span>Michael Franco’s latest collaboration with the actor sees Roth on a Mexican beach holiday, blissfully unaffected by grief 
Neil Bennett is enjoying a nice holiday at a Mexican resort with his sister, Alice, and her two teenage kids. They’ve got the sea view and the infinity pool and a hotel entertainer to sing for them over supper. Then all of a sudden, disaster. The phone rings; their mother’s dead. So Neil does what any sensible son would do in his position. He pretends he’s lost his passport and therefore can’t fly home for the funeral. The woman’s dead anyway, so what does she care?
Clearly it’s wrong to laugh at Michel Franco’s brilliant Sundown but I’m afraid that I did all the same – several times while watching the movie; several more times when remembering it afterwards. It’s the funniest film in this year’s Venice competition, also maybe the nastiest, although it never reaches for laughs or disgust and might just as easily be read as a small-scale human tragedy. Sundown shows Neil’s decision, then proceeds to stroll alongside him like an innocent party. It’s an approach that makes the film all the more blackly comic.

Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, said parents of healthy 12- to 15-year-olds would be asked for consent if coronavirus jabs were approved for their children – expected to be pushed through by ministers this week.

                    <span>The self-described ‘Big Mouth’ brought a rock’n’roll ethos to the manufactured Girls Aloud
For the release of Girls Aloud’s signature 2004 single Love Machine, the girlband juggernaut’s long-term graphic designers Form created a fictional magazine cover for each member. While Cheryl Tweedy is coquettish in cat ears for the stylish Love … mag and Nadine Coyle graces the cover of the Hello!-esque Aloud!, Sarah Harding appears in army fatigues on the cover of Girls, her warpaint augmented by a huge sparkly grin. It quotes a lyric (“We’re heading for war”) accompanied by text that hammers the message home: “Fighting talk from Sarah.” It’s the perfect encapsulation of the pop persona that Harding, who has died from cancer at the age of 39, attracted and often relished: the unruly, fun-loving, tomboyish rebel – or, as she described it in her 2021 memoir, Hear Me Out, the “rock chick, blonde bombshell, party girl, the caner of the band”.
It was Harding’s energy and passion that often gave Girls Aloud an extra frisson of excitement on stage, whether she was endearingly stumbling through dance routines or hitting the odd bum note. Post-Spice Girls, UK pop had become polished and pre-teen again, but with Girls Aloud there was a sense that you should expect the unexpected. Much of that revolved around Harding. As a teenager in Manchester, she was a huge fan of Liam Gallagher, and brought a rock’n’roll ethos to a manufactured band that could easily have defaulted to rote media-trained sheen. (Tellingly, her favourite Girls Aloud single was the pummelling, guitar-led Wake Me Up.)

TikTok has turned off notifications for children past bedtime, Instagram has disabled targeted adverts for under-18s entirely and YouTube has turned off autoplay for teen users: moves seemingly triggered by Britain introducing a new set of regulations aimed at protecting children online.
On Thursday the UK introduced a new set of regulations aimed at protecting children and at a stroke became a global leader in the field, with the prospect of multimillion-dollar fines for companies that breach its new “age appropriate design code” leading to a cascade of last-minute changes across some of Silicon Valley’s largest players.

The Women’s Super League record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema opened the scoring in style, wrong‑footing Jess Carter to squeeze the ball between the near post and a diving Ann-Katrin Berger. Beth Mead added two – the first lashed in from a tight angle, the second offside but not flagged – after Erin Cuthbert had levelled. A header from Pernille Harder closed the gap but a late surge could not prevent Arsenal from securing a first league win against Chelsea since their 5-0 defeat of the Blues at Kingsmeadow in October 2018.

                    <span>James Norbury’s self-published Big Panda and Tiny Dragon inspired by the lives of callers to helpline
A man living below the poverty line, helping others as a volunteer with the Samaritans, who self-published a book after literary agents showed no interest in his earlier work has had his book snapped up in a six-figure deal by publishers in 20 countries so far.
James Norbury, a 44-year-old self-taught artist and writer, who lives in Swansea, has had his life turned around after his collection of drawings of two unlikely friends – a panda and a dragon – captioned with life-enhancing proverbs, was picked up in the deal, an extraordinary achievement for a debut author.

                    <span>Charlotte Northedge wrote a new novel in lockdown. She considers others who have realised the dreams of their youth
I wrote a novel in the last lockdown. To be clear, it wasn’t one of those creative outpourings some people had in between yoga with Adriene and baking banana bread. I had a deadline. Some days, I thought I’d never cut through the brain fog brought about by living through a pandemic. But gradually, as the initial panic subsided and the usual distractions of daily life fell away, I found the words did start to come, and the process of writing my second book was much more fluid and focused than my first.
Which is hardly surprising. I started my debut while on maternity leave with my second baby. I had dreamed of writing a novel since I was a child. I was one of those bookish kids whose weekly highlight was a visit to the library and who spent the best part of my teens squirrelling away short stories and beginnings of novels that never seemed to go anywhere. When I moved to London after my English degree, I joined a writing group and started a thriller.

                    <span>What makes a pub special? From the perfect place to flog atomic secrets to the official strictly protected viewpoint for St Paul’s, a new book tells the amazing stories behind the city’s greatest bars
When you stumble out of the medieval warren of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub on Fleet Street, it’s easy to think you’ve had one too many. As you gaze east towards the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral, the skyscrapers of the Square Mile appear to lean back in a woozy limbo, as if lurching to get out of the way.
It’s not the effect of the real ale, but the result of a curious planning rule. The City of London’s policies have long specified the pavement outside this particular pub as the hallowed spot from which Wren’s dome must be perfectly visible against the sky. Even the towers that stand behind it to the east, like the Cheesegrater and the Scalpel, derive their strange chamfered forms from having to preserve a sacred gap behind the cathedral’s silhouette, when seen from outside the pub.
Trace the lines of London’s historic protected views, and you’ll find that many of them end up outside pubs. It reflects not just the fact that the surveyors enjoyed a pint or two, but the central importance of the public house in shaping the history of the city – a phenomenon that is celebrated in a new book.
“There are already so many books about pubs,” says David Knight, co-author of Public House with Cristina Monteiro. “We wanted this one to be different. It’s not a guide to the best places to have a pint but a collection of social and cultural histories, trying to bring together a more diverse range of voices to explore the value of pubs to the city and society.” While the majority of pub literature may be of the stale white male genre, this compendium includes South Asian Desi pubs, African-Caribbean pubs, and a range of pubs that have played a role in LGBTQ+ history.

Joe Talbot dominated the Bristol band’s post-lockdown homecoming with spring-loaded unpredictability
It’s an eternal question: is it a faux pas to wear a band’s T-shirt to one of their shows? The implied answer from thousands of Idles fans wandering the rolling fields of Clifton Downs is no. This is a sprawling event, featuring 16 acts on three stages, plus bonus late summer sunshine, and yet a reminder of who’s topping the bill is never more than a few feet away.
“We haven’t done this in a while, and neither have you,” vocalist Joe Talbot says from the stage, the afternoon’s disparate gatherings having coalesced into one heaving mass. It’s only a white lie. After travelling down the M4 like a 10-legged version of Phil Collins, this is Idles’ second outing of the day, following a lunchtime appearance at Wide Awake festival in London. That engagement apparently blew any cobwebs away.

The man did not have the filched card worth €500,000 (£429,000) on him, but he did have a plane ticket for Fuerteventura, the LaPresse news agency said on Sunday.

Astrid Sletten is the Afghanistan country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council

It felt surreal to be flying into Kabul international airport rather than out, crossing paths with families who were trying to flee. For three days I sat stranded in a field hospital in the airport grounds, the crowds and chaos blocking any route into the city, the popping of guns blocking any notion of sleep.
I had returned to Afghanistan to head up the Norwegian Refugee Council’s aid operation, through which we have been providing assistance such as education, food and shelter since 2003. Speaking with many of my colleagues, it is clear Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis stretches far beyond the perimeter of Kabul airport.

                    <span>With passenger numbers growing and time to slash emissions dwindling fast, the industry must tackle urgent stumbling blocks on fuel, frequent flyers and more
Aviation tanked in 2020. The number of people taking flights fell by three quarters compared with 2019 levels and as a result there was a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. But as countries open up and people begin to fly again, aviation is expected to see a slow climb back to previous levels. The industry anticipates a return to 2019 passenger numbers globally by 2023 and to be back on track with previous growth projections within a couple of decades.
All this is bad news for the planet. CO2 emissions from the industry are likely to triple by 2050. But if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C, it needs to have hit net zero CO2 emissions by this time. Aviation is a complicated sector to decarbonise. It has some prickly ingredients: difficult technological solutions, hidden extra climate effects, an association with personal freedoms and a disproportionately wealthy and powerful customer base. Here are just a few of the big hurdles the sector will need to overcome if it is ever to be carbon neutral.

It is a business model whose success is based on the fact that so many have been priced out of city living by the housing crisis. Perhaps it would be a good thing if Pocket’s niche did not exist?

Afghanistan is on the brink of economic meltdown. Millions of people are going hungry. Teachers and doctors are going unpaid. The social infrastructure built up over the past 20 years is collapsing, The banks are running out of money. Total collapse could come in days rather than weeks.
A catastrophe can still be avoided but only if politicians in the west – and primarily those in Washington and London – accept that they lost and the Taliban won. Unless the international community engages with Afghanistan’s new rulers and finds a way of providing financial support it will be a classic example of self-harm.

As summer withers away and politicians and journalists prepare for the return of party conferences, a tantalising fantasy is in play, mostly in Conservative circles.
The worst of the pandemic, we are told, is now over. In England employers are starting to reduce working from home, and schools are reopening with hugely reduced Covid protocols. A large part of the public in England seems to believe that life has at last been uncoupled from Covid and its effects, and is somehow being returned to normal, although Brexit-related shortages are twisting reality in yet another unsettling way. At the top of the Tory party, meanwhile, the political optimism ignited by vaccines is still alive, and there remains a hope that ministers might somehow slip free of the Covid crisis and begin to leave the whole mess behind.

Four years ago, when I was a 22-year-old college student in Virginia, I found out I was pregnant. I knew I was late, maybe a bit longer than a week, but that wasn’t unusual – I’d always had irregular periods. Like I had many times before, I picked up a test just in case. It came back positive.
I didn’t tell anyone at school I was pregnant, but I called my mom. She assured me it would be OK, and told me to schedule an appointment nearby, rather than drive home to New York. She was right; I probably didn’t need a seven-hour car ride of contemplative dread.

                    <span>Faced with danger, we act without thinking, as Nicola Kelly found when a day out with her family almost ended in disaster
We were running late that day. Three months into parenthood and time seemed to be perpetually against us – a constant battle against the clock to get the baby fed, changed and out the door.
It was the first Saturday afternoon since the pubs had reopened in England and we were meeting friends for lunch. The streets around southeast London were teeming. Wobbly tables spilled out on to the pavement, trays packed with pints, friends hugging, reunited after too long apart.

                    <span>As disgraced cardinal Theodore McCarrick faces trial in the US, an ex-priest tells of how he testified against the Scottish cardinal
As disgraced 91-year-old cardinal Theodore McCarrick stood in an American court last week, charged with three counts of indecent assault and battery on a minor, the spectre of the late Scottish cardinal, Keith O’Brien, hovered silently over proceedings. Two elderly men, who once donned scarlet robes and mitres, who reached the pinnacle of Catholic church power, stripped to civvies. McCarrick pleaded not guilty to the charges.
O’Brien, the UK’s then most senior Catholic cleric, and a vocal opponent of gay rights, resigned in 2013 after the Observer revealed details of his sexually inappropriate behaviour with priests in his diocese.

The work day in Fangshan starts before dawn and finishes at midday, when fishers or farmers of mango and onion sit together in the shade, sharing a bucket of cooked prawns and bottles of Taiwan beer.
The hometown of Taiwan’s president, Fangshan’s borders encompass a long stretch of coast and four villages home to around 5,500 people, sandwiched between mountains and oceans. Quiet and picturesque, it’s left off most tourist trails, which instead focus on Kenting national park to the south.

Miriam Margolyes has defended her controversial decision to reveal what she believes is the truth about the early death of the great British cellist Jacqueline du Pré. In her new memoir the actor claims that a mutual friend was responsible for secretly assisting the suicide of 42-year-old Du Pré, who was suffering the serious effects of multiple sclerosis.
It is, Margolyes argues, now her duty to speak out, three decades on, although she knows some readers will question her right to tell such a private story.

The pandemic has been a shared experience, albeit one we’ve experienced very differently. Those at low risk followed restrictions to protect those in great danger. Billions of pounds were spent protecting those whose livelihoods were threatened.
A Conservative government built new arms of our welfare state overnight, benefiting millions who might never have received benefits before. The country was given a lesson in the reality that individuals’ economic fate often lies out of their hands: just ask the waiters, pilots and hairdressers who were made redundant.

“He’s a president of the people,” said Marcos Watanabe, the head of the city’s conservative association, sporting a T-shirt stamped with Bolsonaro’s name.

Michael Grecco had low expectations the night he walked into a Boston dive bar known as The Rat. A local punk band was on stage called La Peste – appropriately enough – but Grecco was more into jazz. It was 1978.
He’d turned up on a whim, he recalls, figuring a band named after an Albert Camus novel might possibly be interesting. Then the guitar and drums kicked in, and the lead singer launched into a deafening number called Better Off Dead.

                    <span>From Maggie May to Ronnie Kray, crooks have long inspired songs, as a new book proves
In the 1960s when Sir Stephen Sedley, the former appeal court judge, was a young barrister, he successfully defended a number of Travellers in Kent who had been charged under an old law of “being a Gypsy encamped on a highway”. Getting the charges thrown out gave him status and an introduction to local singers who taught him some of the songs featured in Who Killed Cock Robin? British Folk Songs of Crime and Punishment, the book he has just co-authored with the musician Martin Carthy.
It explores the origins and history of ancient ballads dealing with the wilder sides of life. There are some familiar songs, such as the Black Velvet Band, which was originally about a young man transported for pickpocketing in Belfast, and there is an 1870 version of Maggie May, who is punished the same way for stealing sailors’ clothes. But what about songs of crime and punishment today?

There is always an eeriness in the archives of days that immediately precede tragedy. The newspapers of the day before the Titanic’s maiden voyage, or the reports from the eve of President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas, forever after take on the shadow of innocent, sunlit photos of a suddenly lost loved one. We have come to accept that, 20 years ago this week, on the morning of 11 September, the world as we knew it changed for ever. But from what? What were the immediate befores of that indelible after?
I’ve spent the last few days reading through the papers of the week beginning 3 September 2001, looking for any clues that suggested those were times of relative security and a certain naivety or blitheness, at least in the affluent corners of the west; wondering, with hindsight, if the terrorists’ planes really came out of nowhere, with their era-defining message of hate, as it appeared to so many.

In an open letter, charities including Save the Children, independent campaign groups such as Greenpeace, and the trades union movement, condemn the legislation as “an attack on the UK’s proud democratic tradition and some of our most fundamental rights”.

Tom Wood took this photograph at Croagh Patrick in County Mayo, Ireland, in 2003. It is said that Saint Patrick spent 40 days fasting at the top of the mountain. For centuries, pilgrims have climbed it in search of succour; in recent years they have frequently been joined by documentary photographers, including Josef Koudelka, Martin Parr and Abbas.
County Mayo is Wood’s birthplace, and where he grew up. Though he has gone back to the west of Ireland every year since his family left for England in his adolescence, he had never climbed Croagh Patrick, thinking it too touristy. It was Chris Killip, his fellow photographer and friend, who persuaded him to do the walk against his better judgment; it was, he recalls, a bleak, drizzly afternoon and he’d a bad knee. “Anyway,” he told me last week, “I’m up there. And just for a few split seconds the light changed. So I made two pictures. And that was one of them.”

Shortfalls in mental health services and staffing have been flagged as concerns in dozens of inquests since 2015, the Observer can reveal, with coroners issuing repeated warnings over patients facing long waiting lists or falling through gaps in service provision.
The Observer has identified 56 mental health-related deaths in England and Wales from the start of 2015 to the end of 2020 where coroners identified a lack of staffing or service provision as a “matter of concern”, meaning they believed “there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken”.

The question I have reached a point in my life where I am having to make the major commitments expected, like marriage, homeownership and children. Decisions that shape your life. I recently chose to end a relationship and step away from buying a house, though, because I felt unable to commit wholeheartedly. In some ways, it only felt I reached those significant events because it was forced upon me rather than getting excited and choosing for myself. It’s not that I don’t take a plunge – sometimes I have to, after all I have to live somewhere. But it always seems to be someone else doing the deciding. I just don’t have any eagerness or desire for anything.
The more I think about it, the more I feel that I have this across my whole life and for all my life. I have a very short-term outlook where I can look forward to small things, like a holiday or starting a new job. But I can’t look forward to anything that has future implications. I never stay with an employer for a long time, or even commit to a savings plan.

New Zealand had tried for years to deport the terrorist who stabbed shoppers in an Auckland supermarket on Friday before being shot dead by the police officers tasked with watching him, the country’s prime minister has said.
Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Sri Lankan man, was fighting to keep his refugee status in New Zealand when he carried out the attack, which Jacinda Ardern said was inspired by the Islamic State.

                    <span>USA 2½ – Europe 5½
Sagström picks up ball too soon and loses hole and match

The smell of cordite fills the Solheim Cup air once more. A contest which has an uncanny knack of throwing up moments of huge controversy has reverted to type in Ohio. Nelly Korda, the world No 1, was the beneficiary of an intervention from rules officialsthat left the European captain Catriona Matthew visibly riled. And no wonder; a key moment had been determined by a stopwatch and a television monitor.
Korda’s putt for a three on the 13th during the Saturday afternoon fourball session rested agonisingly above the hole. In an obvious bid to speed up play – the match in question had earlier been warned over their pace – Europe’s Madelene Sagström stepped forward and tossed the ball back to Korda. Cue chaos. Rule 13.3b states: “If the opponent in match play deliberately lifts or moves the player’s ball overhanging the hole before the waiting time has ended, the player’s ball is treated as holed with the previous stroke.” Sagström’s intervention was after seven seconds; 10 were permitted to Korda as per the rulebook. The incident moved the US to one up in the match, which Korda and Ally Ewing duly won by a single hole.

A bid battle for the Yorkshire grocer between two US-based private equity firms has put rockets under Morrisons’ share price, catapulting it into the FTSE 100 as part of the reshuffle this week for a last blast in the spotlight before it is – probably –bought and delisted.

Lara unable to continue due to cut caused by collision

Josh Warrington had promised that he had to win this fight to keep his professional career alive. In the end not even he, Mauricio Lara or any of the 20,000 supporters inside Headingley Stadium could have envisaged what would happen on a raucous, but ultimately disappointing night in Leeds as the fight was ended by an accidental clash of heads.
This night had been littered with encouragement and optimism for Warrington’s career moving forwards, not least given the fact he had shown almost unprecedented determination and focus all week in the run-up to this featherweight rematch with Lara in his hometown. “I’m absolutely gutted,” Warrington said afterwards in what was perhaps a sentiment shared by everyone inside a stadium that has seen so many great sporting moments over the years.

Catalans Dragons made history in the most dramatic fashion with a 31-30 golden-point victory over the champions, St Helens, to clinch the Super League Leaders’ Shield at the Magic Weekend in Newcastle.
The French side came from 30-12 down to draw level after 80 minutes with three converted tries in five minutes and send the game into extra time. The veteran half-back James Maloney, who is retiring at the end of the season, then won the game with a drop goal from 40 metres out eight minutes into extra time to ensure the Perpignan club end in the top spot for the first time.

Jadon Sancho pulls out of squad, Patrick Bamford set for debut

Gareth Southgate has stressed the importance of humility in victory to his England squad and of not angering rival players or crowds as he urged them to seize every moment in the countdown to the Qatar World Cup, beginning with Sunday’s qualifier against Andorra at Wembley.
The manager was delighted at how his team overcame a hostile atmosphere in Budapest on Thursday to beat Hungary 4-0, one that was blighted by racist chants. But he lingered a little on the much-debated reaction to England’s first goal, scored by Raheem Sterling, when Declan Rice picked up one of the plastic cups that were thrown down from the stands and pretended to drink from it.

                    <span>BBC Four’s latest import is a sensationalism-free reimagining of a 1989 Swedish murder case, which trades aspirational design and superhuman sleuths to look deep into societal woes
BBC Four helped kick off Nordic noir’s British boom in 2008 when it aired the Yellow Bird production of Henning Mankell’s Wallander series, starring Krister Henriksson as the brooding Swedish detective. There followed The Killing – made by Denmark’s public broadcaster, DR – and The Bridge – made by DR and Sweden’s equivalent, SVT – plus many lesser imitators. Thirteen years on, though, it’s another Yellow Bird production, also on BBC Four, which best showcases the genre’s subtle yet significant evolution. Like everyone else, the Scandinavians have been swapping fictional stories for true crime.
With a scrupulous lack of sensationalism, The Hunt for a Killer dramatises a 15-year investigation into the 1989 murder of 10-year-old Helén Nilsson in Hörby, Sweden, over six compelling episodes. Five months after Nilsson’s disappearance, police find the body of a 26-year-old woman, and must work out whether they’re looking for a sole perpetrator.

Few players on the women’s tour stand as a greater measure of physical preparedness than the tireless Sara Sorribes Tormo of Spain, but on Saturday afternoon Raducanu was as ready as anyone could be: she simply did not let her play.

                    <span>The India opener showed patience then panache to score an overdue first Test century on foreign soil and frustrate England 
Depending on how you look at it Rohit Sharma’s first Test century on foreign soil took him about five hours of actual game time, or the 23 hours or so that passed after he first took guard in the glaring late-afternoon sunshine towards the end of day two, or a little under eight years, since he made his debut as a 26-year-old against West Indies in Kolkata in November 2013. Whichever, it was another demonstration that in Test cricket you can never have too much patience, as Sharma will surely have reminded himself when he sent his 256th delivery, the first using the second new ball, steepling to long leg after top-edging a pull shot.
His first 50 had been the slowest of his Test career, taking all of 145 balls, a period of occasional runs but frequent walks. Every batsman develops their own method of mentally resetting between deliveries, and the 34-year-old’s is unusual not in the time he takes but in the distance he covers.

It’s easy to imagine the professionals we turn to for help are paragons of virtue. That doctors eat their apples; that personal trainers never skip leg day.
But those we charge with giving advice could very well be going through, or have gone through, the same challenges we turn to them for.

                    <span>With lockdowns leaving thousands unable to access food and other essentials, citizens and community groups are stepping up
It’s a Wednesday afternoon, the day before Redfern-based Koori artist Blak Douglas – AKA Adam Douglas – is about to saddle up his flamboyant yellow ute, Xanthia, and embark on a food hamper blitz around Sydney. His plan is to collect dozens of donated hampers, organised by his friend and fellow artist Justine Muller, to be delivered to the remote western New South Wales town of Wilcannia, where around 10% of its vulnerable, mostly Indigenous population is infected with Covid.
The town’s only general store has already closed once because of a Covid exposure and is at risk of ongoing snap shutdowns as the pandemic worsens, leaving the population unable to access any food or amenities at all. “The influx of donations has been astonishing; I think I’m getting about 20 or 25 hampers, and Justine has a drop-off point in Woolloomooloo for hundreds of other hampers,” Douglas says. A truck will be doing a run from Sydney to Wilcannia in the following days. “I’m just exuberant about what can be achieved in a short space of time, in the middle of a pandemic.”

                    <span>Edgar Wright’s time-travel film plays like a 60s pop song building towards a big climax
The nostalgia gauge is code-red on Last Night in Soho, a gaudy time-travel romp that whisks its modern-day heroine to a bygone London that probably never existed outside our fevered cultural imagination. It’s the era of Dusty Springfield and Biba; great music, cool threads. British writer-director Edgar Wright takes a grab-bag of 1960s ingredients, paints them up and makes them dance to his tune. His film is thoroughly silly and stupidly enjoyable. To misquote William Faulkner, the past isn’t dead, it’s propping up the bar at the Café de Paris.
“You like that retro style, huh?” a classmate remarks to Eloise Turner, a 21st-century design student – and you can bet your house she does. Eloise is up from deepest Cornwall to attend the London College of Fashion, still haunted by her mother’s suicide and struggling to find her feet in a city that’s not like the one she expected. Thomasin McKenzie plays her as your classic fairytale ingenue, guileless and wide-eyed, entirely out of her depth. She’s eyeing the future but her feet are stuck in the past.

The row over how to fund social care threatens to engulf Labour this weekend as Keir Starmer faces pressure from across the party to commit to taxing the wealthy as a way to provide a system fit for the 21st century.
Before the conference season, and as the government prepares to announce within days a hugely controversial increase in national insurance (NI) to fund better care, the TUC leads the charge, calling instead for an increase in capital gains tax (CGT) to meet the costs of reform, and higher wages for care workers.

In a week’s time, the TUC will hold its 153rd congress in London. Shortly before I get up to give my annual address, a short film will be played of some care workers I met in Middleton, Greater Manchester, this summer.
What they told me about working through the pandemic will always stay with me. Coping without personal protective equipment. The trauma of seeing the people they were caring for – and some of their colleagues – die from Covid. One care worker, Carol, who supports adults with complex needs, told me: “We have their lives in our hands 24 hours a day.” A huge responsibility – but Carol earns less than the national minimum wage. It is disgraceful.

                    <span>The travails of the traditional European elite as new money dominated the transfer window suggest things have changed
In times of crisis, the winners are usually the rich. As clubs across Europe continue to struggle against the financial impact of the pandemic, the lesson of this transfer window is that the powerful are mopping up. Or at least they are if they are well-run, which rules out the two Spanish giants and several clubs in Italy.
The transfers of the two players who have defined football for a generation understandably generated great excitement, with fans camping out at the airport in Paris to welcome Lionel Messi and queuing round the block to buy a shirt with his name on the back while Manchester United’s share price rose by almost 10% on the news of Cristiano Ronaldo’s signing before falling back slightly. That will excite executives and seem to vindicate the outlay, although whether those upticks are sustainable enough to pay both players’ vast wages is less certain.

Britain must rediscover the will to lead on global issues | Tobias Ellwood

A senior Conservative MP is demanding an immediate end to the “unseemly and unprofessional” row between the foreign and defence secretaries over Afghanistan, warning that it is further damaging the UK’s already battered reputation on the world stage.
Writing for the Observer Tobias Ellwood, chair of the Commons select committee on defence, says the crisis has exposed the weakness of the UK as a global player, and calls for a complete overhaul of the way foreign policy is handled in Whitehall.

Parents should choose whether they allow their children to be vaccinated against Covid-19 if ministers overrule scientific advice against mass vaccination of healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, the government’s independent vaccine advisers have said.
The government is set to push ahead with vaccinations for teenagers but Professor Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said on Saturday that it was “entirely up to parents” to decide.

                    <span>Global warming sceptics should be hiding in corners. But still some defend the indefensible
No one seems as defeated as the global warming “deniers” who dominated rightwing thinking a decade ago. Like late 18th-century opponents of abolishing the slave trade, Lord Lawson and the claque of Conservative cranks who filled the comment pages of the Tory press are remembered today as dangerous fools – assuming they are remembered at all.
The billions of dollars spent by the fossil fuel industry on propaganda and its acceptance by know-nothing elements on the right caused incalculable damage. They might have followed Margaret Thatcher, who warned in 1989 of C02 admissions leading to climate change “more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known”. The desire of business to protect profits and the vanity of politicians and pundits, who saw themselves as dissidents fighting the consensus rather than fanatics enabling destruction, helped to waste two decades of valuable time.

Novelist and playwright Damon Galgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, at the height of the apartheid era. He wrote his first novel aged 17 and has twice been shortlisted for the Booker prize. His latest, The Promise, spans four tumultuous decades as it traces the afterlife of a white matriarch’s dying wish to bequeath property to her black servant. The novel is heavily tipped to land him a place on this year’s shortlist when it’s announced on 14 September. He lives in Cape Town.
How did The Promise originate?
Books tend to build up out of clusters of ideas or themes that you carry around for a while and worry at. The specific form of this book crystallised around a series of anecdotes that a friend told me when we had a semi-drunken lunch, about four family funerals he’d attended. It occurred to me that would be quite an interesting way to tell the story of one particular family. The promise itself also arrived from a friend, who was telling me how his mother had asked the family to give a certain piece of land to the black woman who had looked after her through her last illness, as it happens in the book.

Donald Trump is reportedly close to selling rights to his hotel near the White House in Washington, a move the website Axios said “would carry a symbolism savoured by opponents”, given it would mean “the removal of Trump’s brash, golden branding from Pennsylvania Avenue”.

                    <span>A 1943 melodrama offers one of the best portraits of a single woman Hollywood ever drew
Out in the world again, I’ve seen a lot of new exhibitions and a bit of new theatre, the heart going out to those actors who, in spite of great reviews, are still taking curtain calls to the sound of too few hands clapping. But in the end, the cultural highlight of my summer had nothing at all to do with novelty. At a BFI cinema on London’s South Bank, I saw Old Acquaintance, a melodrama of 1943 starring Bette Davis, and thought, not for the first time, of a line by the film critic, E Arnot Robertson, who wrote in Picture Post: “I think Bette Davis would have been burned at the stake as a witch if she had lived three or four hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet.”
The BFI’s Bette Davis season, now sadly over, was bliss: an embarrassment of riches to be enjoyed in the velvety dark, preferably with a surreptitious hip flask of something strong (the bars are still closed). But what to choose? Old Acquaintance, which is about the love-hate relationship between two women who’ve been friends since childhood (Miriam Hopkins co-stars) is a pretty awful movie, the high-tide mark of the “woman’s picture” of the 1940s. But I love it for two reasons. The first is that, in Davis’s character, a writer called Kit Marlowe, we have one of the most sympathetic portraits Hollywood ever drew of the single woman. The second is for Davis herself, who turns in a performance so extravagantly good, she might be in a different film altogether. The patrician voice. The oyster eyes. The sheer command of every emotion from yearning to ambition. On the way home, my jaw ached: the effect of having spent almost two hours with it wide open in amazement.

Of all the political posters and billboards that line the streets of German towns and cities this late summer, the ones most likely to stop commuters in their tracks are those bathed in traffic-light red.
Using a stark colour scheme usually exclusive to the Marxist-Leninist parties on the fringe of the German left, the posters are surprising in more ways than one: in the centre of the picture sits a bald, suited man who looks less like a leftwing rabble-rouser promising you radical change than a middle manager at a regional building society scrutinising your loan application.

                    <span>Ten years after village doc Le Quattro Volte, Michelangelo Frammartino returns with an observational piece centring on a deep-cave system in Calabria
In 2011 Italian artist Michelangelo Frammartino scored a small indie hit with a film called Le Quattro Volte, a metaphysical study of a mountain village that featured bleating goats and ringing bells, charcoal burners and Roman centurions. Le Quattro Volte was odd and gentle and by and large people loved it. I’m not sure how much money one earns from a small indie hit. Probably enough to pay for a weekend break in Tropea. Now Frammartino is back – 10 years later, not wanting to rush things – with the lovely Il Buco, another film that is content to saunter on the wild side, gazing at woods and sky, rocks and trees and identifying a serene, quiet heaven in everything that it sees. It’s not quite a documentary, yet nor is it exactly a narrative feature. It lives alone; the cinematic equivalent of a hermit on a mountaintop.
Frammartino’s last film was inspired by Pythagoras. This one takes its prompt from a 1961 potholing expedition in Calabria, mapping out a labyrinthine cave system which was confirmed at the time as the third deepest in the world. The film shows the cavers descending its slick twists and turns and uncovering an old photo and a damp magazine with JFK on the cover. Whatever item slips into the crevasse instantly becomes history, or a lost memory; a teasing remnant of the people who once walked above.

Being a parent can feel, at times, like leading an authoritarian nation of one. You control what your subject can read, who they can speak to and what they can do; you deal with periodic revolts against your rule and occasionally engage in a simulacrum of democratic decision-making while knowing that you control the outcome.
But for all that authoritarian leaders like to present themselves as a parental figure for the country at large, it’s rare that they actually get involved with the day-to-day work of, well, parenting. Which is why the news that China is taking on the job of limiting gaming time caught the attention of so many parents I know.

Before the pandemic, every morning and night was a cycle of stress and rushing around for single mother Emma Woodburn, getting her two young sons to and from school, childcare before and after work and staying on top of housework.
But when, 18 months ago, the 39-year-old from Lancashire was told by her employer she could work from home, everything changed. “It was like a weight was lifted. It was less rush in the morning. I could put the washing on throughout the day and hang it out on my dinner break. It just felt easier.”

                    <span>Marvel’s latest blockbuster is an electrifying fusion of convincing characters and breathtaking CGI
Although it often feels as though barely a month passes without another comic book movie puffed as a new pinnacle of achievement for the superhero genre, it’s vanishingly rare for a film to actually deserve its hype. But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does so, and more. Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, is canny enough to realise that the key to success with an effects-driven, eye-popping extravaganza is not the CGI spectacle, it’s the basic stuff. Textured characters. Karaoke and shots-fuelled friendships. And electrifyingly badass fight choreography.
In the goofy exchanges between Simu Liu’s Shaun (heir to his father’s tricky relationship with power, and his mother’s fierce empathy) and his best friend, defender, drinking buddy and fellow valet car-parker Katy (Awkwafina), the film is already one of the freshest Marvel pictures in a long time. And that’s before the fight on a runaway bus featuring an eastern European man mountain with a laser arm prosthesis.

                    <span>Charlie Gilmour never wanted to have children – his father had abandoned him at six months and he feared he’d do the same. But then a magpie came into his life and changed everything
It wasn’t long after our wedding – on our New Forest honeymoon, in fact – that my partner gently raised the prospect of having children. On paper, the moment couldn’t have been more perfect. Down a deer track, through a thicket of waist-high ferns, we’d discovered a clearing of sweetly scented camomile. Everything around us was bursting with life: pheasant cocks scurrying through the undergrowth; resin dripping indecently from the clefts of the evergreens. But off paper, it felt as if all the sap had been sucked from the scene. Babies, as far as I was concerned, were like unexploded bombs, at once fragile and potentially devastating. Certainly best left for the experts to handle.
Brephophobia is the fear of babies. My particular version of it had roots in my own infancy. My biological father had, as far as I could tell, been broken by a baby and he seemed, in many ways, a more capable man than me. When Heathcote and my mum Polly met in the late 1980s, he was on the brink of becoming a bestselling poet with his epic Whale Nation – although that wasn’t the only string to his bow. He was a playwright, tipped by Pinter and Burroughs; an actor beloved of Derek Jarman; a radical housing activist who’d helped found the Independent State of Frestonia, sheltering the homeless; and an accomplished magician who used his conjuring abilities to rob Harrods.

When New York fashion week kicks off on Wednesday – effectively the first since the pandemic interrupted, and then collided with, the social justice movement to force recalibrations across much of the industry – many eyes will be on Lindsay Peoples Wagner.
At 30, she presents a new guard of fashion editor, in this case of the Cut, an influential addendum to New York magazine. She and her peers seek to change the focus of fashion, and with it place more emphasis on the multiplicity of gestures and signals, nuanced or otherwise, people make with the clothes they wear.

Coronavirus – live coverage

An Oklahoma doctor has said overdoses of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which many believe without evidence can prevent or cure Covid-19, are helping cause delays and problems for rural hospitals and ambulance services struggling to cope with the resurgent pandemic.

Speaking at a media conference in Wellington on Saturday, New Zealand’s prime minister said that of the seven injured, five were in hospital, and three of them were in a critical condition.

                    <span>The comedian, 60, talks about growing up wild in the Black Country, marrying her on-screen grandson and finally being able to be a grumpy old woman
My childhood was unusual, an Indian family plonked in the middle of the Black Country. I was a Midlands wench outside the house – climbing trees, running wild – and a good Indian girl at home. The duality was great for my spirit, a common story for the children of Indian immigrants. Always swapping masks – both inside and out of the experience – gave us this third eye, a perfect preparation for creative life.
Dad lived through the partition of India and Pakistan. At 13, he saw appalling things no child should see. His life was ripped apart with a random line drawn by a lawyer in London. He fled to a refugee camp with only the clothes on his back. This might have made some people bitter, but my father was empathic, loving and wise. Seeing the worst of humanity made him want to be the best of it instead.

                    <span>The Theranos saga is depressing, but there is one silver lining: the preoccupation with the #girlboss is dead, and Holmes helped kill it
A brown man made her do it! Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of blood-testing startup Theranos, was once seen as a maverick thinker and a fearless feminist icon. Now that she is standing trial for fraud, however, she’s set to argue that she bears no responsibility for her actions: she was completely under the control of her ex-boyfriend and former Theranos executive Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. According to court filings, Holmes’s lawyers will argue that Balwani, who was almost 20 years older than Holmes, emotionally and sexually abused her. Holmes’s lawyers write in the court filings that she was the victim of a “pattern of abuse and coercive control” that essentially “erased her capacity to make decisions”.

The komodo dragon, the world’s largest lizard, is threatened with extinction as rising water levels driven by the climate crisis shrink its habitat, according to the latest “red list” update.
Endemic to a handful of Indonesian islands, the komodo dragon lives on the edge of forest or in open savannah, rarely venturing higher than 700 metres above sea level. Rising water levels are set to affect 30% of its habitat in the next 45 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has changed its status from vulnerable to endangered.

                    <span>I have never been seriously ill or spent a night in hospital, but I’m plagued by fears that a terrible sickness is coming for me. How did I fall victim to health anxiety?
“This minute I was well, and am ill, this minute.” The pain arrives slowly, like a Polaroid sharpening into view, but the fear comes suddenly: a channel switched, a cloud sped across the sun. It’s June 1989, I recently turned 20, and I am supposed to be studying for first-year exams in English, at University College Dublin. Instead, I’m letting a morning’s MTV binge slide into the afternoon and paying keen attention to the fingers of my right hand, which have begun to ache. In the days that follow – though I only half believe it’s happening – stiffness spreads to my wrist and elbow, to the other arm, to my hips and knees. I start hobbling, and hunch over on the bus on my way to university. I will have to repeat some exams, but my affliction will have vanished by midsummer, walked off one hot day in St Stephen’s Green.
Most of my life, from early adolescence onwards, has been punctuated by these episodes, more or less alarming, depending on my symptoms and the disease I have decided is expressed there. Fretful interludes have remained secret, never spoken about to parents, friends or professionals. Others have been, or felt, dramatic: the shock of a sudden lump, rash or pain must be taken to a GP, then to specialists, only to be quickly dismissed, or dissolved in the weeks-long agony of appointments and results. Still others have lingered for months or even years, dragging at daily life, relationships, career prospects.

Schoolchildren should be given the Covid vaccine to avoid allowing the virus to “run through the population”, a leading scientific expert has said, after official vaccine advisers concluded the net health benefit in vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds was too small.
On Friday, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) stopped short of a recommending vaccinating healthy 12- to 15-year-olds against Covid, saying “the margin of benefit is considered too small” to support universal vaccination.

As a trainee zoologist, I love all animals, but I really love snakes! I’d never seen a wild adder, so when we went on an adventure to Colne Pointe nature reserve in Essex – which is famous for its adders – I felt fizzy with excitement. Adders are most commonly seen on sunny afternoons when they try to warm up. They are Britain’s only venomous snake which makes them even more mysterious. You have to use your eagle eyes to see an adder as they are very shy.

Right, that’s it, it’s finally happened. The doctor just called and confirmed. I have Reality TV Dating Show Fatigue, a rare disorder that primarily affects TV reviewers and people whose girlfriends watched not one but both seasons of Too Hot to Handle. “A single episode of Celebs Go Dating on E4 has enough scenes of men in skinny jeans guessing the age of girls they are on dates with to kill you,” the doctor warned me. It is incredibly medically inadvisable that I do this – I have an EMT on hand and they’ve already dialled two nines – but: I am going to watch the first episode of the Katherine Ryan-fronted Ready to Mingle (Monday, 9pm, ITV2).

The smell of rotten eggs, the signature scent of sulphur emissions, lingered in the air. In an effort to burn off toxic chemicals before and after Hurricane Ida, many industrial facilities sent the gases through smoke stacks topped with flares.
But the hurricane blew out some of those flares like candles, allowing harmful pollution into the air.

Nine people share their reaction to the ruling and what they think it means for women’s rights.

                    <span>Logistics sector ups its recruitment and training effort but big obstacles lie ahead
For an insight into the hottest spot in Britain’s jobs market, an industrial estate on the outskirts of Bristol is a good place to start.
There, at a logistics depot on Royal Portbury Dock at the mouth of the River Avon, apprentices are making the leap from an array of jobs to becoming HGV drivers.

                    <span>The Pointless presenter’s debut crime caper sold millions, with movie rights snapped up by Steven Spielberg. Richard Osman talks to Alex Clark about growing up poor, meeting his estranged father and why he wrote his first book in secret
Sometimes, Richard Osman tells me, complete strangers shout the words “Helen Mirren” at him in the street. He is tickled, but wonders what other passersby make of it. If they have read one of the million-plus copies that Osman’s debut novel, The Thursday Murder Club, has sold, and if they are as good at lateral thinking as the book’s quartet of senior amateur detectives, they may work out that Mirren is a fantasy casting suggestion for Elizabeth, the ex-spook whose capacity for deductive logic takes centre stage in the next book in the series, The Man Who Died Twice.
Elizabeth is a corker of a character: mysterious, steely, aware not only of what’s going on around her, but uncannily tuned in to what’s about to happen too. In her crime-fighting exploits, she’s assisted by three neighbours in her retirement community in the Kent-Sussex borderlands: former rabble-rousing trade unionist Ron; his best pal Ibrahim, a psychiatrist; and Joyce, a cake-baking retired nurse on the constant lookout for love. Joyce’s diary entries – with a touch of Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett’s bathetic, quotidian humour about them – punctuate the novels’ third-person narration.

September’s a month that always feels a bit like a new term, whether or not you’re packing the kids back to school. Memories of school carry, for many, the not-always-sweet smell of overcooked cabbage, but that can be easily set right. Cabbage is just one member of the brassica family whose leaves, flowers, stems and roots can all be eaten – think broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, hispi … The solution to that familiar school corridor smell is not to overcook it and to balance it with something creamy (such as yoghurt) or sweet (such as coconut). So there we go: the first lesson of the new term and, I hope, some delicious recipes to set everyone on their September way.

                    <span>That your life becomes entirely about your kids once you have them is not proof that’s how life should be
I am of an age when most of my social group is in their late 30s and early 40s, and, as has always been the case, the majority of my friends are women. So I find myself increasingly having this conversation – usually with a friend, but sometimes with a nice woman I bond with at a party or somesuch – and it goes like this: she always assumed she would have kids, but she didn’t meet the right partner in her 30s, and actually it was fine because she was so busy with her career, and who can afford kids anyway? But now she’s 40 and while she’s not desperate to have kids, she’s also not that keen on losing the option. It kinda sucks being the only one among her friends without kids, when the WhatsApps are full of Hey Duggee chat, and what will happen to her when she’s old? Will she be all alone? So should she have a baby now? I look her right in the eyes and I tell her what I always tell women in these circumstances: don’t bother.
I need to clarify two things here. First, this is in no way a reflection of my feelings about my own children, whom I genuinely cannot imagine my life without, even though I lived for almost 40 years without them. That your life becomes entirely about your kids once you have them is not proof that’s how life should be – it’s a reflection of what kids are like. It’s strange how often people confuse the cause and effect here. I can only assume it’s done mainly by parents who are trying to reassure themselves that they definitely made the right life choices when they realise that, for the next eight years, their weekends will no longer be about seeing their friends, but consist entirely and only of shepherding their kids to playdates and making awkward small chat with random people who just happened to have had kids around the same time as you.

• ‘People try to stop us speaking up’ – Jolie meets inspirational young campaigners
Angelina Jolie sits at a desk, back straight as a rule and rather regal. Her features are cartoonishly beautiful – straight black hair, vertiginous cheekbones, huge blue eyes and lips like a plumped red sofa. She is talking on Zoom to four young activists. It is a horribly apt day to be discussing human rights – the Taliban has just captured Ghazni city on its approach to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.
If this were a movie, you might suspect Jolie was playing a divine leader addressing the fortunate few. Yet it soon becomes apparent that things aren’t quite as they seem. The actor and film director is the one in awe, not the activists. The young people talk about the work they have done raising awareness of the carnage in Syria, the environmental crisis, trans rights and food poverty. Jolie hangs on their every word. She tells them they have inspired her children who follow their work, warns them against burnout, apologises for the failings of her generation and says how honoured she is to meet them.

“I just feel awful bringing it up,” said Kilmer, a retired conservation group communications director from Denver, Colorado. “And yet, I feel like talking about it is absolutely key to getting people to understand it.”

                    <span>Forty years since the first black cricketer played for England, players open up on their experiences
In 1981, David “Syd” Lawrence played his debut season for Gloucestershire – a big deal for a 17-year-old, who had inherited his cricketing passion from his Jamaican father. He was sitting in his hotel room during his first away game when there was a knock at the door. He opened it to find a banana skin outside, left there by one of his own teammates. “And I just remember shutting the door…” says Lawrence.
That’s all the former England bowler manages, for a long while. The pain of the memory has sandbagged him, and he needs time to recover. “I’m sorry,” he says eventually. “It’s hard when you relive this.”

                    <span>With my brother-in-law’s group, nobody seemed to care how little I’d helped on the headwind
I’ve done enough group cycling in my life to say this with authority: it’s impossible for someone at my level, which is to say competent but not a grafter. Cycling clubs tend to be wonderfully inclusive and will meet you wherever you are (metaphorically speaking; literally, you have to meet them wherever they are, which is usually at the top of a really big hill). Whatever it takes, they’ll wait for you. Consequently, even on a leisure ride, a portion will be spent in profound embarrassment that some poor schmuck has to hang back for you. So you go a bit too fast, and the embarrassment commingles with cardiac discomfort until your face and every other part of you is bright red. The alternative is the complete beginner’s ride, with someone well-meaning explaining how to indicate.
I solved this by hitching my apple wagon to my brother-in-law’s mishmash of a group; so informal that they’re unbranded, so fit that they cycle in France (the hilly bits), but – here’s the kicker – so nature-loving, so whimsical, that they will stop for anything. They’ll stop if they see an unseasonably large toad. They’ll stop for a baby owl, or a field of poppies rolling across the eyeline like a red rash. I, too, would like to stop for these things, but it’s a chance for me to catch up, which I grab with both hands.

On the morning of 11 September 2001, an 18-year-old was driving his white Honda Civic on the way to work as a freelance web designer. It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland’s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day.
Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington.

Champion joins call for para athletics in non-disabled meets

Hannah Cockroft slashed her hand on the wheel of her chair on Saturday morning. She was unable to get stitches because it was too close to her race, which took place on a slippery surface under the pouring rain. Still, no bother. Cockroft duly entered the arena of the Olympic Stadium and left the field in the T34 800m for dead, claiming her seventh Paralympic gold medal in the process, and only just missing out on her own world record. “I’m absolutely gutted,” she revealed afterwards, with a smile.
Depending on the angle you viewed the race from, it was possible to think that Cockroft was out on the track alone, so great was the distance between herself and the rest of the field. She won in a Paralympic record time, despite sodden conditions in the Olympic Stadium.

Under the plan put forward by Great Britain’s energy regulator, electric vehicle drivers could earn money by effectively transforming their cars into mobile power plants by releasing power back to the energy network when demand on the electricity grid reaches a peak.

People asking for weight-loss help are on average 2.27kg (5lbs) heavier than those starting the programme during the previous three years, the research reveals.

                    <span>Six-year-old pronounced dead a day after his younger brother also died after eating soup made from death cap mushrooms
A second child of an Afghan family evacuated from Kabul to Poland has died after eating soup containing death cap mushrooms, which the family had unknowingly gathered in a forest outside their quarantine centre.
The six-year-old boy received an emergency liver transplant but doctors were unable to save him. His five-year-old brother died on Thursday at Poland’s main children’s hospital in Warsaw, where both were treated.

Giant trees knocked sideways. Homes boarded up with plywood. Off-kilter street signs.
Less than a week after Hurricane Ida battered the Gulf Coast, President Joe Biden walked the streets of a hardhit Louisiana neighborhood on Friday and told local residents, “I know you’re hurting, I know you’re hurting.”

Coronavirus – latest updates

Boris Johnson’s former director of communications has blamed a lack of expertise in Whitehall for the government’s struggle to get its message across in the early days of the Covid crisis.
Lee Cain was a key adviser to Johnson, who boasted about shaking hands on a hospital visit, claimed the government could “turn the tide” within 12 weeks, and said it would be “inhuman” to cancel Christmas, days before ordering millions of people to spend the festive season at home.

Long before the name Mānuka became synonymous with a booming honey industry, celebrity endorsements and protracted global disputes, it was known in Māori legend. After Tāne Mahuta, the god of forests, separated his parents from their locked embrace, he set out to cloak Papatūānuku (his earth mother) in trees. One of these trees, born from his union with Tawake-Toro, was the Mānuka, with its dense, spiky foliage, delicate white flowers and unique pollen.
Mānuka is considered a taonga, or treasure, of which Māori are considered the kaitiaki (guardians). The legend, and the Māori relationship to Mānuka, has become an important tool in a global battle to protect Aotearoa New Zealand’s Mānuka honey brand, the most bitter part of which is between New Zealand and Australia.

If Irish eyes are smiling come Saturday lunchtime in Toledo, one of golf’s supreme forces will have been vanquished. Leona Maguire, on her Solheim Cup debut, has been tasked with taking down the Korda sisters. Maguire, the first player from Ireland to compete in this biennial event, will team up with Mel Reid in match three of the foursomes session. Nelly and Jessica Korda, the stars of the US show even in defeat at Gleneagles two years ago, lie in wait. Maguire articulated her thoughts on the showdown – including a touch of psychological warfare – with the confidence of a veteran.
“I’m excited,” said Maguire. “It’s obviously their golden pairing. There’s going to be a huge amount of pressure on them. Both myself and Mel are fighters, we will give it absolutely everything we have.

For a fleeting moment Mason Mount felt vulnerable. The England midfielder sensed what was coming. He had set up Raheem Sterling for the breakthrough goal in the 55th minute of the 4-0 World Cup qualifying win over Hungary, the Puskas Arena in Budapest was gripped by pin-drop silence – a strange sensation – and the England players were celebrating towards one of the corner flags. They were by the end that housed the Carpathian Brigade, the hardcore group of Hungary supporters who dress in black shirts.
“As soon as we scored … you could tell within the atmosphere that something was going to be thrown or something would happen,” Mount says.

To reach Nakida village in the highlands of Fiji, Dr Losalini Tabakei and her colleagues hiked for hours, up and down mountains, through forests, down muddy slopes, across rivers and along treacherous ridges with steep slopes of bamboo forest on either side.
Their supplies – clothing, medical equipment and, crucially, the Covid-19 vaccines they were bringing to administer to the remote community of just 60 people – were sent separately on horseback; the vaccines in refrigerated boxes, the rest in bags wrapped in plastic. The horses took the longer but flatter route to the town along the river.

My anxieties and those of thousands of young people in Australia are real, and they will not be alleviated by school chaplains.

Oh look, it’s spring! The days are getting longer, the evenings smell like jasmine, the hayfever-people are sneezing and rubbing their eyes. Pollen is everywhere, which means only one thing:

Cricket’s culture wars can call a truce. There is something traditionalists and progressives agree on, and rather surprisingly it’s about the Hundred. Now the all-important final scores are in – and we’re talking bums-on-seats and eyes-on-screen, not who hit most sixes or which weird-named franchise triumphed – there is consensus on a single, indisputable fact. The tournament was A Good Thing for women’s cricket.

                    <span>Maggie Gyllenhaal’s accomplished directing debut makes humid, sensual cinema of Ferrante’s novel
Olivia Colman gives a powerhouse turn in The Lost Daughter, prickly and combustible as Leda Caruso, a middle-aged languages professor on a working holiday in Greece. In flight from her past, possibly from herself, she stares at the sea as though it’s done her a great wrong and eats alone at the bar, repelling anyone who draws close. She haunts the resort like a ghost while other ghosts are haunting her.
In her excellent directing debut, Maggie Gyllenhaal conjures Elena Ferrante’s 2008 source novel into humid, sensual cinema: a captivating miniature, full of telling details and little dramas writ large. The likes of Ed Harris, Dakota Johnson and Paul Mescal provide The Lost Daughter with an impressive Greek chorus. But this is Colman’s stage and her tragedy. You can’t take your eyes off her for a second.

Speaking at the opening of the IUCN World Conservation Congress, the president echoed warnings from leading scientists that humanity must solve ongoing crises with climate and nature together or solve neither, urging the world to catch up on preventing the loss of biodiversity.

For some time during its initial 51-year run, A Question of Sport (BBC One) had a round called What Happened Next?, which saw footage from a game freeze-framed, and the ex-players on the panel asked to predict the outcome. It was usually a dog or a streaker running on, or the ball bouncing off the ref into the net.
In future quizzes on TV, panellists may find it hard to believe that, when Sue Barker was dropped as presenter of A Question of Sport after 24 years, what happened next was that comedian and dating show host Paddy McGuinness moved into her chair. After Barker, David Coleman and David Vine, this is the first time the show has been fronted by someone who isn’t a serving BBC sports broadcaster.

One government source described “chaos” in a jittery Downing Street on Friday, after leaks about plans for an increase in national insurance contributions (NICs), including the contested claim that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has been demanding a rise of two percentage points.

Practices in England have begun contacting patients to postpone their immunisation without being able to rebook them at a later date. The problem emerged on Friday when vaccine maker Seqirus wrote to surgeries alerting them to the possibility of having to rearrange booked appointments.

Ministers could for the first time defy the advice of their official vaccine advisers and push ahead with Covid jabs for all 12- to 15-year-olds, after the scientific body concluded the net health benefit in vaccinating the age group was too small.
In a move that highlights a growing divide between government and scientific advisers over the next phase of the vaccination programme, ministers will seek extra evidence which may help overturn the watchdog’s verdict.

Sounding the alarm for a wide range of products and services going up in price, business leaders said the UK was facing a “perfect storm” of worker shortages and problems with global supply chains that would lead to a burst of inflation within months.

                    <span>Denis Villeneuve’s slow-burn space opera fuses the arthouse and the multiplex to create an epic of otherworldly brilliance
Dune reminds us what a Hollywood blockbuster can be. Implicitly, its message written again and again in the sand, Denis Villeneuve’s fantasy epic tells us that big-budget spectaculars don’t have to be dumb or hyperactive, that it’s possible to allow the odd quiet passage amid the explosions. Adapted from Frank Herbert’s 60s opus, Dune is dense, moody and quite often sublime – the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse. Encountering it here was like stumbling across some fabulous lost tribe, or a breakaway branch of America’s founding fathers who laid out the template for a different and better New World.

                    <span>A plan to split the proceeds of a national insurance rise between the NHS and social care could worsen intergenerational injustice
An announcement on social care funding is imminent, with a national insurance rise the probable outcome. But what ought to be unambiguously good news, after years of delay, is not. Far from being the best solution to a problem regarded as intractable only because governments do not want to pay for it, the proposal to raise up to £10bn a year from extra NI contributions is closer to the worst.
 The current impasse is untenable, not least because of the burden it places on the NHS. The difficulties created for hospitals by the lack of suitable social care arrangements have been documented for years. With the health service facing unprecedented pent-up demand as another autumn-winter season of Covid and its knock-on effects approaches, ministers know they have to do something if they are not to risk a wave of public wrath.

                    <span>The shadow of the departing chancellor looms over a contest too close to call
In September 1998, when a relatively youthful Gerhard Schröder defeated Helmut Kohl and ended his 16-year reign as German chancellor, the victorious leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) told supporters that the country had opted for “a change of generation”. Mr Schröder’s triumph turned a page on the cold war era, aligning Germany with a fresh-faced centre-left resurgence in western democracies led by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. It was, in the political vernacular, a quintessential “change” election.
Almost a quarter of a century later, Angela Merkel will stand down of her own accord later this month – the first chancellor to do so – after equalling Mr Kohl’s longevity in office. But this time, ahead of a 26 September election, German voters seem to be somewhat reluctant to move on. None of Ms Merkel’s prospective replacements come close to matching her popularity. Fewer than one in five see the chancellor’s own preferred successor, the CDU/CSU candidate, Armin Laschet, as the best option to replace her. Caught on camera laughing during a visit to a town devastated by floods, Mr Laschet has fought a lacklustre campaign and has become a liability for his party. A poll last week found that from highs of around 35% at the start of the year, the CDU/CSU’s ratings have plunged on Mr Laschet’s watch to the low twenties and fallen just behind the SPD for the first time since 2006. The Greens electrified the contest by topping polls in the spring. Their extraordinary surge seemed to embody a widespread desire for a more environmentally driven politics to meet net zero pledges. But they too have lost their mojo as the party’s candidate for chancellor, the inexperienced Annalena Baerbock, struggles to recover from allegations of plagiarism and financial mismanagement.

On his last proper album, 2018’s Scorpion, Drake showed signs of maturing. While musically it was a mixed bag, the record found the Canadian superstar grappling with fatherhood – a fact unwittingly revealed to the public in a diss track by rival Pusha T. Ending with March 14, a song that drew comparisons between his oft-discussed experience as a child of divorce and his disappointment at now being a single parent himself, it hinted that a man known as one of music’s most egregious navel-gazers may have emerged enlightened and self-aware.

Emma Raducanu was in the process of tearing through yet another higher ranked opponent on Thursday, establishing a 6-2, 4-0 lead against Zhang Shuai in the second round of the US Open, when the experienced Chinese player began to pull her back down to earth. As Zhang landed blows and harassed the Raducanu forehand, the rallies lengthened and the intensity became more pronounced.
It was at Wimbledon two months ago that the match intensity against another top-100 player, Ajla Tomljanovic, proved too much for Raducanu, leading to her retirement from their fourth round match due to breathing problems. But here she adjusted well and closed off the match 6-2, 6-4, clinching match point by winning the final attritional exchange.

During a press conference on Thursday, Mario Draghi said all Italians of eligible age could soon be obliged to get a shot, as soon as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gives its conditional approval for four vaccines.

An Iranian tanker carrying fuel bound for Lebanon was at anchor in the Red Sea on Friday ahead of the final leg of a voyage to Syria, which is set to pose the biggest test yet to US sanctions imposed on two arch regional foes.
The tanker is expected in the Syrian port of Baniyas early next week, in defiance of US sanctions that prevent oil exports from Iran and imports to Syria, which have both been subject to stringent US-imposed restrictions on trade. The imminent arrival is being hailed by the Lebanese militant group turned political bloc, Hezbollah, as a sanctions-busting solution for an energy crisis that has brought Lebanon to a standstill and led to widespread blackouts.

Major oil companies are being pilloried on social media for sending “thoughts and prayers” to victims of Hurricane Ida while sidestepping their role in the ongoing climate disaster.
At least two ExxonMobil outposts – from Beaumont and Baytown, Texas – tweeted the message on Monday, using the hashtag #LouisianaStrong. It didn’t take long for Twitter users to call out the company for its tone-deaf response, noting that Exxon’s own internal research program predicted catastrophic climate change decades ago.

                    <span>Sadly, blending in for a quiet life remains a necessary survival strategy for far too many people in Britain today
It is impossible to know how much of the surge in reported hate crimes against LGBTQ people is due to escalating harassment and violence, and how much is down to the increased willingness of victims to inform the authorities. What we do know that is that recorded homophobic and transphobic hate crimes have jumped every year since 2015, and yet with an estimated four in five still going unreported, the already grisly figures only hint at a far bleaker reality.
The incidents vary in nature and severity: from abuse hurled at someone identified as LGBTQ because of their appearance, or mannerisms, or a fleeting or profound show of affection towards a partner; to gay men being beaten and robbed, as happened in a suspected homophobic attack on the streets of Edinburgh last month, or a trans man savagely attacked in Bournemouth earlier this year. “According to our research, many experienced verbal harassment, physical abuse, threatening messages, and damage to property,” says Eloise Stonborough of the LGBTQ civil rights organisation Stonewall.

                    <span>Labour should seize the opportunity to make the case for alternative ways of funding social care
The Conservative government is reported to be considering an increase of up to 1.25p in the pound in national insurance contributions from 26 million people in work to help cover the costs of patching up Britain’s crumbling social care system. The party hopes that the win of “solving” the social care crisis will outweigh the political betrayal of breaking a clear manifesto promise to freeze national insurance. But the funding option proposed is unfair, with those in work expected to subsidise elderly rich people. If Labour is sharp, it can win a big political victory here – and show itself to be the party with the fair, long-term solutions to a crisis a decade in the making.
The Conservatives have floated Labour’s 2002 increase in NICs as a precedent, with the public reaction at the time rather muted. But circumstances were very different. Labour did not breach a manifesto promise to push through its 1p increase. Real wages and salaries in 2002 had been rising for a decade. And the NICs rise was brought in to pay for the National Health Service.

                    <span>The new reality show on Charli and Dixie D’Amelio attempts to transfer one kind of gargantuan fame into another with mixed results
“I get asked why I’m famous a lot,” says Charli D’Amelio, the most followed person on TikTok, early in the third episode of her family’s new Hulu reality show. Just two years ago, she was a high school sophomore in suburban Connecticut posting snippets of dances and jokes with friends to the app. Now 17, she has 123.6 million followers on the app; she and her sister Dixie, 20, are two of the most recognizable faces among Gen Z, superstars on the most culturally influential social media platform in the country right now.
Yet “I don’t consider myself famous,” she says. “I’m just a person that a lot of people follow for some reason. I think it was right place, right time. I think it was a vibe, maybe, that I give off.”

A great glute-strengthening exercise that particularly benefits desk-bound lower backs; it will also improve hip mobility, which can get too tight when you’re sitting for too long. I use it at the beginning of my yoga classes to prepare the hamstrings and glutes for the yoga practice ahead: it’s low-impact, but if you’re doing it properly you will feel the burn.

                    <span>Readers respond to an editorial about understanding quantum theory and defining the laws of physics
Your editorial on quantum physics (30 August) starts with a quote from Richard Feynman – “nobody understands quantum mechanics” – and then says “that is no longer true”. One of us (Norman Dombey) was taught quantum theory by Feynman at Caltech; the other (John Charap) was taught by Paul Dirac at Cambridge. Quantum theory was devised by several physicists including Dirac, Erwin Schrödinger and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s and 1930s, and Dirac made their work relativistic.
It is absurd to say that quantum mechanics is now understood whereas it was not 50 years ago. There have of course been advances in our understanding of quantum phenomena, but the conceptual framework of quantum physics remains as it was. The examples you give of nuclear plants, medical scans and lasers involve straightforward applications of quantum mechanics that were understood 50 years ago.

Your article (Paws for thought: dogs may be able to figure out human intentions, 1 September) was interesting, although like most dog owners, I smile at some of the efforts of scientific researchers to find out what we know already. My cocker spaniel, Meg, doesn’t need to use mental reasoning or theory of mind to work out our intentions. She just listens to the conversation.

Dominic Raab has been reluctant to criticise Joe Biden, who has faced an unprecedented wave of criticism over the US exit from Afghanistan, partly because he always saw the decision as inevitable, and partly because in principle he instinctively sympathises with it.
The foreign secretary is trying to position the UK as close as possible to the Biden administration, even though the criticism of the US president continues unabated from former British diplomats, politicians, security chiefs and military figures.

Apple will delay its plans to begin scanning user images for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) before uploading them to the cloud, the company says, after a backlash from privacy groups.
The company’s proposal, first revealed in August, involved a new technique it had developed called “perceptual hashing” to compare photos with known images of child abuse when users opted to upload them to the cloud. If the company detected enough matches, it would manually review the images, before flagging the user account to law enforcement.

After months of havering, the government is poised to make two big announcements in the coming weeks. Both break manifesto pledges, both are fraught with political danger.
First, perhaps as early as next week, comes the long-awaited plan for social care, expected to be funded by an increase in national insurance contributions. That breaks the pledge made in 2019 not to raise income tax, VAT or NI. Then, in the next month or so there is likely to be an announcement that the state pension will not rise in line with the expected 8% rise in earnings this year. That breaks the pension triple lock: an annual uprate of 2.5%, annual inflation or earnings depending on which is the highest.

                    <span>Kristen Stewart’s entirely compelling Di has no escape from the dress-up game of monarchy in Pablo Larraín’s unreverential movie
Sandringham, Christmas 1991. Bare trees, frosted fields, dead pheasants on the drive. Inside the grand house the dining table has been laid in readiness, but one of the principal guests – arguably the main course – is running late and lost. She grinds her car to a halt, tosses her perfect hair in frustration. “Where the fuck am I?” asks Diana, Princess of Wales.
And so begins this extraordinary film, which bills itself as “a fable from a true tragedy” and spotlights three days in the dissolution of Charles and Di’s marriage. Working off a sharp script by Steven Knight, Chilean director Pablo Larraín spins the headlines and scandals into a full-blown Gothic nightmare, an opulent ice palace of a movie with shades of Rebecca at the edges and a pleasing bat-squeak of absurdity in its portrayal of the royals. Larraín’s approach to the material is rich and intoxicating and altogether magnificent. I won’t call it majestic. That would do this implicitly republican film a disservice.

Two singles released from Abba’s first album in 40 years have raced to the top of the streaming charts, in a comeback that has generated praise and excitement among fans who remember the original releases and a new younger audience.
The first two singles from Abba’s forthcoming album, to be released on 5 November, were in first and third place on YouTube’s trending rankings in 12 countries on Friday, including the UK. I Still Have Faith In You gained 4.4m views within 24 hours in Britain and Don’t Shut Me Down 1.4m views. 
In a further confirmation of the Scandinavian pop band’s cross-generational appeal, Abba have already amassed 991,000 followers and 5.5m likes on TikTok despite only joining the platform on 1 September.

                    <span>Draconian laws in European countries and the effects of Brexit and Covid-19 are making safe terminations harder to access

Mara Clarke is the founder of Abortion Support Network

The state of Texas now has the most restrictive abortion law to be passed in the US since Roe v Wade legalised abortion in 1973. Texas residents must now add out-of-state travel to the many barriers that already exist to getting an abortion. There has been an outpouring of support for Texas women from people in the UK and European Union, but it’s worth remembering that while the UK and Europe are an abortion utopia compared with some American states, abortion access is still not guaranteed.
Let’s start with the UK. Due to the herculean efforts of activists (and despite the best efforts of a foot-dragging, anti-abortion government), Northern Ireland now has limited access to legal abortion. But Alliance for Choice, the campaign group in Northern Ireland, says that proper access to abortion is still not guaranteed across the country. Women are still waiting for the department of health to commission abortion services, telemedicine and more types of available abortion. Currently, the majority of abortions happen in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and are performed with pills, which carry a small risk of failure. Because there is virtually no provision for abortions after the first trimester, people seeking these services are still forced to travel to England.

I have just turned 17 and will soon go to college. I have always done well at school; I don’t drink, use drugs or even have a boyfriend, and would like to think I’m responsible. But choosing a career path has been rough.
I wanted to be a teacher, but my dad incessantly told me not to pursue that path because the salary isn’t great. I ended up agreeing and not going down that route. He wants me to study law; I said I would try to get into a good place to do it, as that is what he seems to want.

                    <span>Allianz Premier 15s kicks off, Harlequins defending title
Players with suspected concussion to be examined

England’s leading club women’s competition, the Allianz Premier 15s, kicks off at midday on Saturday with a west country encounter between Bristol Bears and Exeter Chiefs. There is a high level of expectation with many of the players hoping in 12 months’ time to be flying off to New Zealand for the World Cup and fans back in grounds closed to them during the pandemic.
There have been some intriguing transfers in the summer, too, but arguably the most significant move in the competition this weekend will be off the pitch. In line with the men’s game, HIAs, head injury assessments with any players suspected of suffering concussion leaving the field to be examined by a doctor, will be used for the first time in the Allianz 15s. With this week’s publication by the University of South Wales into damage to the brain caused by collisions in professional rugby, the decision to monitor women is a welcome one.

According to the movies, a dead body can be used as a pretty much bulletproof human shield. You know the kind of scene. Under heavy attack, a character grabs the nearest corpse to hand and holds it in front of him, successfully using it as a kind of improvised meat armour to absorb gunfire, instead of taking it himself. Is this possible in real life? The popular science show Mythbusters ran a segment on it a few years ago and found that, while you could probably pick up a dead body in a gunfight, the idea that it would stop the bullets from hitting you was completely implausible.
Anyhow, with a hail of criticism bombarding the government from all sides, including its own, courageous big man Boris Johnson will reportedly hold an in-person cabinet meeting next week. Which is nice. It’s been a little irksome for the nation being lectured on the necessity of returning to the office by a government that phoned in its response to the fall of Kabul from a paddleboard.

Pair will face off for bronze medal in singles on Saturday

Of all the many emotional moments that have made these Paralympic Games such an involving, stirring spectacle, it is hard to think of one where the athletes were so visibly distraught. Red-eyed, shoulders slumped, their stares cast to the ground, Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett were inconsolable on Friday evening in Tokyo after experiencing defeat for the second time in as many days and as many Games.
On Thursday the British wheelchair tennis stars, currently ranked in the top five in the world as individuals and the best as a pair, were both beaten in the semi-finals of the singles competition. A day later and they were beaten in the gold medal match of the doubles, by the same French pairing that had vanquished them five years ago in Rio.

There are eight times as many refugees and asylum seekers living in Labour-run parts of Britain as in Conservative areas, analysis by the Guardian has shown, amid growing pressure on ministers to fix the “completely immoral” dispersal system.
The government has urged all local authorities to come forward to offer homes to the thousands of families recently evacuated from Afghanistan, but only about a third of councils have volunteered so far.

The man, whose name is covered by legal suppression orders and who is referred to only as “S” in court proceedings, was found guilty by a jury of possessing objectionable material, and failing to assist a police officer exercise a search power.

I am typing these words in Portugal. I cannot quite believe it myself. When it comes to foreign holidays at the moment, there are two groups of people, certainly among my friendship group, which I am not for one second suggesting is a robust sample. One group thinks that the idea of going abroad is an impossible dream, and that the people who do so are rolling the dice on the future of their families. They are also secretly hoping the rules change and everyone has a nightmare getting back – a sentiment I completely understand. The other group thinks that going abroad is our God-given right, that we have to do it for our own sanity, and that the 18 months in which British people have been unable to go on foreign holidays has been one of the greatest hardships of modern civilisation. 
The holiday itself has been wonderful. We booked a couple of weeks, because you have to write off the first week to just looking at one another and saying, “I can’t quite believe we’re in another country!” There have been some issues. We went to a water park the other day. Whenever I go to a water park, I have to focus on my kids’ enjoyment, rather than what thousands of children are emitting into the water, as well as dealing with feeling hideously self-aware when wandering around in shorts. We can argue about whether this is low self-esteem or narcissism, but the point is, I spend most of my time at water parks trying to protect my children from developing the same sort of hang-ups I have. This was made trickier by the fact that one of our kids said his favourite thing about the water rollercoaster was how my body was jiggling on the way up.

A group of Apple workers is organizing to fight against what it says are patterns of discrimination, racism and sexism within the company and management’s failure to address them, in a rare public display of dissent within the notoriously secretive company. 
Last week, a group of employees launched #AppleToo, a campaign to gather and share current and past employees’ experiences of inequity, intimidation and abuse. The group hopes to mobilize workers at a time when workers across the tech industry are calling for greater accountability from their employers, and to push Apple to more effectively address such complaints.

Deep inside Paris’s historic law courts on the bank of the River Seine, builders were putting the finishing touches to an extraordinary architectural structure described as a cross between a high-security bunker and modern church.
Its sleek pale wood and white lighting were chosen by the French justice ministry to create “a sense of calm” in contrast to the horrific events which will soon be examined there. This temporary structure will from next week host the biggest criminal trial ever held in France, when 20 men are accused of planning, aiding and carrying out the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks on a stadium, bars and restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall.

I’ve just dropped Sarah Storey off at the airport. On the way, we had a really good chat in the back of the taxi. I’ve known Dame Sarah for 20 years; we competed at the Sydney Paralympics together and what she’s achieved since has been incredible. It was nice to have that time together as the Games heads towards the final stages, to get some nuggets of wisdom from her and see how much she’s absorbed of what has happened in the past two weeks.
When we were in the taxi, and everything was all done, Sarah was relaxed. She was giving me the latest on her family, her son, Charlie, and her husband, Barney, and her eyes lit up as she talked. Sarah is the warmest, kindest nicest person you’ll ever meet. But when we flew in to Tokyo on the same flight, the mood was different. I had a chat with her then too, but her guard was up. She was in sport mode.

A Banksy painting that partially shredded itself after being sold at auction is going back under the hammer.
The subversive street artist stunned the art world when his Girl With Balloon attempted to self-destruct in London in 2018 immediately after the conclusion of the auction.

                    <span>This extremist vigilante abortion law is of a piece with everything else Republicans are doing: overturning democracy itself 
The American right has been drunk on its freedom from two kinds of inhibition since Donald Trump appeared to guide them into the promised land of their unleashed ids. One is the inhibition from lies, the other from violence. Both are ways members of civil society normally limit their own actions out of respect for the rights of others and the collective good. Those already strained limits have snapped for leading Republican figures, from Tucker Carlson on Fox News to Ted Cruz in the Senate and for their followers.
We’ve watched those followers gulp down delusions from Pizzagate to Qanon to Covid denialism to Trump’s election lies. And rough up journalists, crash vehicles into and wave weapons at Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist protesters at least since Charlottesville, menace statehouses, issue threats to doctors and school boards testifying about public health, and plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, for imposing Covid-prevention protocols.

Taxpayers should pay more to fund social care, according to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who suggested this should be through a tax increase rather than a national insurance rise that “disproportionately targets” the young.
The government is close to announcing a plan to increase national insurance rates by at least one percentage point, to fund its solution for the long-term funding of the crumbling social care system, with a final decision expected to be made within days.

Sixty doctors, nurses and other health professionals have staged a die-in protest outside JP Morgan’s Canary Wharf headquarters in London to highlight the bank’s investment in fossil fuels.
The protest on Friday was organised by one of Extinction Rebellion’s groups, Doctors for Extinction Rebellion. The climate activist medics said this was their biggest protest so far and that JP Morgan was the biggest funder of coal, oil and gas extraction.

                    <span>I could have sold my 1.3kg truffle for a fortune. But I had something more special in mind

It was 2am when I left the house that night in November 1999. I was heading out into the Motovun forest in Istria, in the north-west of Croatia, to hunt for truffles. Serious truffle hunting is done at night – it’s better for the dogs, as the moisture carries the smell of the truffle better, and also it’s harder to be followed.
It was a freezing night – the temperatures at that time of year dip below zero. Being a truffle hunter is not an easy job: it’s usually wet and muddy in the forest. You often get scratched and dirty, and can return empty-handed. Still, I had a gut feeling that the night would be a good one, so with Diana, my trusty German pointer, I set off.

These plans, codenamed Operation London Bridge, which were first revealed in a Guardian Long Read in 2017 and have now been seen in full by Politico, detail the scale of the arrangements for the funeral and government anxieties about whether the UK has the resources to execute them.

Having watched a woman and her baby die needlessly after being refused admission to a hospital over a lack of money, Liyatu Ayuba wanted to never let it happen again.
The 62-year-old is one of Nigeria’s nearly 3 million internally displaced people (IDPs) – driven out of their homes by the violence of the Boko Haram Islamist militants. Ayuba fled Gwoza in the north-eastern state of Borno in 2011 with her family. After her husband was killed by Boko Haram and her teenage son badly wounded, she went to the makeshift Durumi 1 IDP camp, in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, where about 500 families live.

                    <span>In primary school, I had a friend who I wanted to keep all to myself. Then fate intervened, in an unexpected and unfortunate way, to make it happen
When I was eight, I lived in fear of never making a friend. Then I made one, and lived in fear of her finding any other friends. Rosie was in the year below, puckish, quite surreal and completely carefree, which made her magnetic. You couldn’t do so much as a tour of the playground without someone thinking she would be a great addition to a skipping cartel, British bulldogs or a plot. She also had great hand-eye coordination, so, even without her character, her qualities would have been in high demand. This meant I had a medium-level phobia of playgrounds, which I managed as best I could by hiding it and praying for rain.
So this day, not the memorable day, was shaping up as badly as it possibly could. She was asked to join in with a game of rounders. I was spectating, shooting murderous looks at anyone who cheered her or in any other way sought her attention. A teacher joined in, Mr Gubbins. I probably shouldn’t name him in case I’ve misremembered, but it was 40 years ago and he has a funny name. Let’s say it was him or it wasn’t.

                    <span>With new petrol and diesel vehicles to be banned in the UK from 2030, what can a road trip the length of the UK teach us about the future of cars?
Of 30m cars on the road in Britain, only 250,000 are electric – but the number is going up fast. In July, new figures showed sales had risen 50% in a month; they are expected to outsell petrol and diesel models by 2025. And new petrol and diesel vehicles are due to be banned completely by 2030.
That’s unambiguously good news for the environment – and yet many drivers are sceptical of going electric, worrying about underpowered engines and an inadequate charging network. Are those fears justified? What’s the chat like at the service station plug-in points? And why did that gull have to relieve itself on a loaned Skoda Enyaq just before the photographer showed up? Sam Wollaston sought the answers to all these questions on a road trip from Land’s End to John o’Groats, and joined Rachel Humphreys to reflect on what he learned along the way.

                    <span>Survey of specialists forms part of Brendan Murphy’s brief to national cabinet on the ability of the health system to cope with rising Covid cases
Intensive care doctors have warned that Australia’s health system could face months of surge demand that will strain the workforce as a result of the Delta outbreak, as they stress the need for an increase in Covid vaccination rates to ease the burden on hospitals.
The federal health secretary, Brendan Murphy, will update Friday’s meeting of national cabinet about the hospital system’s ability to cope, informed by a survey from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (Anzics), after the Australian Medical Association warned that the system was already struggling.

Reddit is seeking to hire investment bankers and lawyers for an initial public offering in New York, two people familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency.
Reddit was valued at $10bn in a private fundraising round last month. By the time the IPO would take place early next year, the online message board company is hoping it will be valued at more than $15bn, one of the sources said.

Sweden recovered from a goal down to hand Spain their first World Cup qualifying defeat for 28 years with a shock 2-1 victory on Thursday.
Alexander Isak and Viktor Claesson produced sumptuous finishes to cancel out Carlos Soler’s early goal for the Euro 2020 semi-finalists and move Sweden top of Group B.

District attorney says Sharon Hill officers were returning fire

Investigators said on Thursday it was likely police fired the shots that killed an eight-year-old girl outside a high school football game near Philadelphia last week.
The Delaware county district attorney, Jack Stollsteimer, issued preliminary findings in the investigation, in what he said was an attempt to be transparent.

                    <span>It was an evening when, yet again, England had more than mere footballing problems thrown at them. It started with a hail of plastic cups, first for Raheem Sterling and then Luke Shaw, from the diehard Hungary supporters behind one of the goals, and it escalated to a firework – which was hurled in the wake of Harry Maguire’s header for 3-0.
England’s players were celebrating as a group and it was a mighty relief that it missed its target, fizzing for a while before burning out. And then in the closing stages came the low point that everybody had dreaded.

                    <span>Oscar Isaac is a blank-eyed poker player with a past in Schrader’s latest gathering of lost, tormented souls
Paul Schrader makes films about lost souls in torment and unachievable goals, the sort of bleak existential purgatories that speak to our own uglier moments. Ahead of the Venice press screening of his latest production, an impromptu security cordon makes more than 100 guests late, after which they are only allowed into the cinema in small dribs and drabs - a tense, shuffling progress that extends throughout the film’s opening half-hour. The critics are in uproar; the ushers get lairy. Wherever he is, I imagine that Schrader himself would approve of the show.
On screen, The Card Counter provides another stylish, slow-burning account of Schrader’s lonesome samurai, a figure who can crop up in all walks of life: as a taxi driver, an escort, a drug dealer, a priest. On this occasion he’s embodied by a blank-eyed Oscar Isaac, who wears his scuffed leather jacket like a bulletproof vest. William Tell (formerly Tillich) is a veteran of Abu Ghraib and served eight years for his crimes. He now earns a living at the card tables and roulette wheels of middle America. The film has him driving the strip malls at night or prowling the stygian bowels of interchangeable casinos, with their patterned carpets and heavy black drapes. These joints have lights blazing everywhere and yet always appear cloaked in shadow. The gamblers, one worries, bring the darkness in with them.

Manchester United have confirmed returning signing Cristiano Ronaldo will wear the No 7 shirt. The Portuguese forward wore the iconic digit during his first spell at Old Trafford, becoming tied to the figure.
Striker Edinson Cavani has offered to vacate the shirt number, and will now wear 21 on the back of his shirt, the same as he uses for Uruguay. Cavani was in the No 7 when he came off the bench in the 1-0 win over Wolves at the weekend. Premier League rules stipulate any mid-season change of number requires the club to provide replacements to any fans who have paid to have the name and number of the previous occupant on their back.

Abba Voyage is probably just going to be a cruise, I thought. Only in my dreams did I think it would be a new song. Then at 6pm came the news: a whole new album, with two tracks released at once to herald its arrival.
Heralding this pop miracle are I Still Have Faith In You (★★★★) and Don’t Shut Me Down (★★★★★), two songs precision-honed to wallop emotion out of the listener (if you’re willing, that is: if you’ve always been immune to Abba’s charms, these songs won’t melt your cold heart). I’ve been an Abba fan since I was a little girl, and the opening strings on the former, full of minor-key melancholy, had me welling up immediately, pointing as they do to a classic Abba trope. Here’s a melody that feels like it’s already in its middle – leaving the listener lost, rooting around for something to console them – before it moves, with exquisite deliberation, towards the first verse (Dancing Queen also does this brilliantly).

Raducanu yet to drop a set at this year’s tournament

On the morning after the remnants of Hurricane Ida had swept across the New York area, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its path, at Flushing Meadows in Queens, efforts were focused on cleaning up ahead of play. The combination of torrential rain and thunderous wind had battered spectators, toppled refreshment stands and even led to it raining indoors under the Louis Armstrong Stadium roof. Play was suspended across all but the Arthur Ashe Stadium.
As the tennis restarted the one sight that remained entirely unchanged was the joy and confidence that Emma Raducanu carried with every ball she struck as she continued her rise. In her fifth match at her debut US Open, and against by far her most accomplished opponent, the 18-year-old treaded even deeper into the unknown by thoroughly outplaying Zhang Shuai of China 6-2, 6-4 to reach the third round without dropping a set.

The grumble here in 2018 about Melrose’s controversial £8bn hostile takeover of GKN didn’t relate to the buyer’s supposed status of private equity-style vulture. That easy caricature has never quite fitted Melrose, a company that, yes, aims to sell everything it buys within five years, but also tends to invest heavily as well as cut costs.
Rather, the point about the takeover was that a majority of GKN shareholders rolled over too cheaply and delivered a bargain to Melrose. That analysis was threatened when the pandemic clobbered both of GKN’s core markets – automotive and, especially, aerospace. But, now the economic weather is improving, the original turnaround script looks intact. It’s just been delayed a bit.

The UK’s top climate adviser has pushed back strongly against “defeatist” criticism that the country’s net zero target is expensive, and urged the Treasury to pick up the currently “incremental” pace of decarbonisation.
Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), urged the debate over net zero to be framed in a more positive light: “It can be done,” he said. “It is worth it … I hope we can move away from thinking about the cost and see it as a mission to modernise the economy.”

“Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,” the FAA said in a statement to the Guardian on Thursday.

                    <span>The supreme court’s refusal to block the law marks a grave blow to the freedom and safety of women
The cruel, vindictive and dangerous law that has taken effect in Texas is much more than the most extreme anti-abortion legislation in the United States. To many, it understandably feels like the beginning of the end – denying women the rights enjoyed under the landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which established that abortion is legal before the foetus is viable outside the womb, at around 24 weeks. It will further embolden the religious right. Though polling suggests the majority of Americans believe that terminations should be legal in most or all cases, this is already the worst ever legislative year for restrictions.
But it is better understood as the end of the beginning. The right to abortion has, in practice, been systematically dismantled through methods ranging from intimidation to cynical regulation. This moment is the culmination of the first stage in a decades-long war on the rights of women, made possible by Donald Trump’s appointment of judges known to support restricting reproductive rights. A divided supreme court refused to block the legislation while the legal battle over it plays out.

                    <span>Labour should have a policy to deal with rich people seceding from the rest of society by buying social privilege
Gordon Brown gave substance to the slogan of “levelling up”. In 2006, he said that his “long-term aim” was to fund state school pupils at the same level as those in private schools. Back then, fee-paying schools had 60% more resources per pupil. Mr Brown made some headway: by 2010, he had raised state school funding by 20% to a high point of £7,200 per pupil. Since then, the Conservative party has been in charge. In the last decade, independent school income has raced away while state school spending per pupil in England, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has seen the largest cut – 9% in real terms – in over 40 years.
The thinktank has sifted the wheat from the government’s rhetorical chaff. Even with Boris Johnson’s promised extra £7bn in state school spending, per-pupil expenditure in 2023 will still be “1 to 2% lower in real terms” than in 2010. Mr Johnson’s commitment to “fair funding” turns out to be bigger real-term funding increases for wealthier schools than for ones with more deprived intakes. A pay rise for teachers may arrive, but potential recruits face larger class sizes and equipment shortages.

Dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists have carried out a mass act of non-violent civil disobedience by breaking bail conditions ordering them to stay away from the City of London financial district.
The activists joined with hundreds of supporters in a low-key rally outside the Bank of England on Thursday afternoon, listening to speeches from a mobile sound system.

A Charity Commission inquiry found the Alternative Animal Sanctuary in Boston, Lincolnshire, was chaotically run, spending just £900,000 on the care of animals from an £8m fund raised by the public over seven years.

                    <span>So much of our polity drenches us in pain, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith, but even within torrential misery there are sparks of brightness
I had thought I had come to terms with suffering in the world. I have a good life, good husband, enjoy my job, good health, lovely place to live, no money worries. On an intellectual level I know being sad won’t help anyone. I do some volunteer work, vote for who I believe is a better choice, donate some money to charities I believe in, live a simple life, I thought that was enough.
But, recent world events have broken through. How can I experience joy when there is so much suffering? I could turn off the news, withdraw even further, but is that not selfish cowardice? Should I not at least bear witness? I feel like outside is endless suffering, which I can not stop. I feel guilty, then I feel self indulgent about feeling guilty. I don’t know what to do, or feel any more.

With arms outstretched and legs kicking, a grandfather and grandson glide over office towers and city blocks, their flight powered by imagination, a rudimentary green screen and a VHS camera. The scene is part of a cache of footage shot by Brisbane musician Sam Poggioli’s grandfather, Merv, who passed away in 2003 when Poggioli was a teenager.
The green screen flying experiment now appears in the video for his single Memories in Flight, released under Poggioli’s Sampology moniker. Finishing recutting the family footage for the single’s video, he says, “was a joyous feeling that also made me want to cry”. He was only eight years old, but precisely remembers looking back at his grandfather behind the camera, while they filmed in Merv’s shed.

The writer Jenny Diski is on her way to Antarctica. At Grytviken, an abandoned whaling station on South Georgia, she spots a “grey, jellied mountain”.
“Elephant seal is one of those euphemistic names humans give creatures who remind them of what they don’t want to be reminded of,” she writes. But her fellow travellers want to be reminded: they take pictures. Maybe the elephant seal will get a spot on someone’s wall. It will be the first time in history that a person has chosen to decorate using that face.

A decision on extending Covid vaccinations to 12- to 15-year-olds is expected to be announced imminently, following days of increasing pressure on the government’s vaccinations watchdog to approve the idea.
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) held a long discussion on the issue on Thursday, followed by a vote.

                    <span>Going back to Naples and the tragedy that changed his life, The Great Beauty director evokes his adolescence with bawdy vigour
At 16, Paolo Sorrentino returned home to find that both his parents were dead, killed by a carbon monoxide leak. On the night of the tragedy, Sorrentino was inside a football stadium, watching Diego Maradona play for his local team, Napoli. Afterwards, he would say – not wholly joking – that Maradona saved his life.
More than three decades on, in the middle act of a career that has already won him an Oscar, the Italian film-maker has retraced his steps, turned back the clock and fashioned this foundational horror into a fevered coming-of-age tale, a movie that played to a capacity crowd here in Venice. The Hand of God, no surprise, is Sorrentino’s most nakedly personal film to date, almost to a fault in the way it jettisons the cool distance of The Great Beauty or Il Divo in favour of a sweaty, close-up evocation of youth. It’s a picture only Sorrentino could make. But that doesn’t necessarily make him the safest pair of hands.

                    <span>Classical composer famed for his film scores to Zorba the Greek and Serpico, and for his firebrand politics
For those with only a nodding acquaintance with Greece and Greek music, the name of Mikis Theodorakis, who has died aged 96, still conjures up Zorba the Greek and that moment on a Cretan beach when Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates break into an ecstatic dance. It was often hard for the classically trained composer to live down his image as a writer of memorable film scores. Despite the performance of his operas, symphonies and songs in some of the major concert halls of Europe, Theodorakis remained, for many, the man who wrote the catchy bouzouki music of Zorba and the Costa-Gavras film Z.
For those who remember the 1967-74 military dictatorship in Greece, he was also a symbol of resistance to that regime. But Theodorakis was much more than a political symbol and a writer of film scores. He was a composer of great melodic gifts: he composed more songs than Schubert and the best of them – his settings of Lorca, Seferis, Brendan Behan, Kambanellis, Elytis and Ritsos – do not suffer by the comparison. It may be that his other works will one day occupy a place in the repertoire of 20th-century classical composition, but his songs will undoubtedly remain the most enduring legacy of the man known to his friends simply as o psilos – the tall one.

Forty years after the bitter songs written in the wake of two band divorces for their last album, 1981’s The Visitors, the Swedish pop quartet have reunited for Voyage, an album of brand new songs that will be released on 5 November – including, they say, a Christmas song.

                    <span>Attempts to legitimise warfare should be met with scepticism, argues Andrew Clapham. Plus letters from Prof Keith Hayward, Blaine Stothard and Margaret Vandecasteele
Samuel Moyn is right to emphasise how humanising war has distracted attention from questioning whether there should be a war in the first place (How the US created a world of endless war, 31 August). We could go further and argue that the permissive interpretation of the rules that he highlights has actually led to a dehumanisation in war.
The last 20 years have seen torture, multiple targeted killings by drones controlled from a safe distance, apparently self-explanatory categories such as “law-of-war detainees”, “law-of-war targets”, and the destruction of objects contributing to what has been called the “war-sustaining economy”. It is as if once one accepts one is at war, we accept that sticking a “law-of-war” label on all the killing and destruction makes it inevitable and acceptable.

                    <span>John Rippon says the public and policymakers should be aware of the potential harm caused by potassium chloride and Mike Pender says there is no need to add more salt, or substitutes, to food
Re your report in the print edition (Salt substitute cuts risk of heart attack – study, 31 August), it was with great alarm that I read the statement attributed to Prof Bruce Neal that “if you were to replace all of the salt on supermarket shelves with salt substitutes, you would prevent thousands of strokes and heart attacks every year”. According to a report by NHS Kidney Care, “more than 1.8 million people in England have diagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, there are thought to be around a million people who have the condition but are undiagnosed. CKD can substantially reduce quality of life, and leads to premature death for thousands of people each year.”
Most diagnosed kidney patients must strictly limit their intake of potassium as an excess of this element in the body can lead to stroke and sudden heart failure. As the report states, the most ubiquitous substitute for sodium chloride (common salt) is potassium chloride. Therefore, far from preventing strokes and heart attacks, such a widespread substitution could cause many thousands of extra such occurrences among patients with significantly reduced kidney function. As a kidney dialysis patient, I believe that this fact should be made widely known among the public, but particularly among potential policymakers.

Coronavirus – latest updates

There is “almost certainly no urgency” to press ahead with booster shots for healthy adults and it may be better to see how the pandemic pans out before a decision is made, the scientist leading key research into third shots has said.
Prof Saul Faust, chief investigator of the Cov-Boost study whose data next week is expected to help inform a decision on the rollout of boosters across the UK, told the Guardian that for now it may be preferable to prioritise only the vulnerable, including those with compromised immune systems.

                    <span>Jobs, wages, housing: young people are paying a price. We have to address this or risk their anger boiling over
The pandemic’s next effect might be a wave of political conflict. A rising tide of anger among young people at what they have willingly sacrificed for older people emerges in a major survey across 12 European countries. It has split the continent along old faultlines – rich versus poor zones, north and west versus south and east – dividing people between those strongly affected and those barely touched. But most starkly the rift falls between generations: two-thirds of over-60s have done relatively well, while two-thirds of under-30s feel their opportunities have been cruelly truncated. Their trust in governments has fallen perilously.
One “warning” is a repeat of the 1968 youthquake: some of us who were there might think that’s long overdue. Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, which produced the survey, says young people “feel like those who fought in wars. They complied, they obeyed to save parents and grandparents, yet they are the long-term victims.” Damage to their jobs, education and life chances will possibly scar that generation permanently.

Krzysztof Penderecki’s four numbered string quartets do not trace the course of his creative development anything like as faithfully as, say, the six quartets of Bartók or the five of Elliott Carter map the progress of those composers. A 40-year gap separated the composition of the Second Quartet in 1968 from the Third, an interval broken only by the tiny quartet movement Der unterbrochen Gedanke, written in 1988 as a memorial to Penderecki’s publisher.

Children involved in religious organisations, including Sunday schools and madrasas, are vulnerable to sexual abuse in cultures where victim blaming, abuse of power and mistrust of external authorities are common, a report says.
The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said there was “no doubt that the sexual abuse of children takes place in a broad range of religious settings”. It found evidence of “egregious failings” and highlighted the hypocrisy of religions that purport to teach right from wrong, yet fail to protect children.

Like most headteachers I view the formal start back to school with a mixture of optimism and trepidation.
There is a realistic hope that, following a mass vaccination programme for adults, school life can begin to look and feel like it is approaching normality again. Assemblies, staff meetings, extra-curricular activities and the simple yet inspiring buzz of learning and social interaction can resume in earnest. After a bleak, disruptive 18 months these everyday pleasures must be celebrated.

The court’s order is stunning. Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.
Last night, the court silently acquiesced in a state’s enactment of a law that flouts nearly 50 years of federal precedents. Today, the court belatedly explains that it declined to grant relief because of procedural complexities of the state’s own invention. Because the court’s failure to act rewards tactics designed to avoid judicial review and inflicts significant harm on the applicants and on women seeking abortions in Texas, I dissent.

My motive for writing a book was selfish. I’d been making films for a quarter of a century and, at the start of last year, I wanted to step back and think about the way I was working. 
A book was a useful excuse to speak to other British directors about their experiences. And, during the first lockdown, many of them had enough time on their hands to oblige. So, by Skype and Zoom, I spoke with 15 people: Paweł Pawlikowski, Danny Boyle, Joanna Hogg, Asif Kapadia, James Marsh, Andrew Haigh, Carol Morley, Edgar Wright, Steve McQueen, Lynne Ramsay, Stephen Daldry, Ben Wheatley, Peter Strickland, Mike Leigh and Ken Loach.

                    <span>Young, angry men are falling down a rabbit hole of online radicalisation. The isolation of Covid will only make this worse
Read a book, as the old saying goes, and it will set you free. But even the power of literature surely has its limits, and this week a judge in Leicester tested them. Faced with a Nazi sympathiser convicted of downloading bomb-making instructions, and white supremacist and fascist material from the internet, Judge Spencer issued a suspended two-year sentence and instructions to read Jane Austen or Charles Dickens instead. “Think about Hardy. Think about Trollope,” he added, helpfully. Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, the judge thought, might be a good place to start.
It might have made more sense had he recommended Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. For Ben John, the 21-year-old former student convicted of downloading more than 67,000 extreme documents, seems to have fallen down a depressingly familiar dark rabbit hole. The judge described him as a lonely individual with few, if any, proper friends. He fits a well-worn pattern of socially awkward, angry young men retreating from the outside world into dark online subcultures, where each click leads to something more extreme. For John, it was white supremacism and fascism. For others it could be Islamist fundamentalism, or a violently misogynistic incel culture, where men who can’t get women to have sex with them vent their frustrated rage against women everywhere.

There were those few weeks of strange, haunted gigs in autumn 2020, but for most people live music disappeared at the start of March last year and didn’t return until this summer. It was a peculiar enough experience being in the crowds, but what was it like for the artists walking on stage after 18 months without the hum of amps, the dimming of house lights and the roar of an audience? From festival headline sets to low-key club shows, this is how the return to playing live felt for the musicians who came back.

A woman has spoken of her gratitude after she managed to track down the two men who saved her son from drowning.
When seven-year-old Frankie Creek fell off a jetty at Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes one evening last month, his mother, Natasha, was too distracted by their barking dogs to hear the splash.

                    <span>A 17th triumph makes her the most decorated Paralympic athlete in British history and she may be still a contender in 2024
Attempting to put a marathon athletic career into context can seem reductive. It is 29 years since Dame Sarah Storey won the first Paralympic gold medal of the series which reached a climactic point on Thursday morning, when her victory in Tokyo’s rain-soaked C4-5 road race pushed her gold medal tally to 17, making her the most crowned Paralympic athlete in British sporting history. That’s five more golds than the golden couple of British Olympic cycling, Jason and Laura Kenny.
When Storey tackled her first Paralympics aged 14, as a swimmer in Barcelona, cycling was a Cinderella sport. Chris Boardman’s gold medal in that Games was a glorious aberration, and the “medal factory” in Manchester – which now seems as if it has been there for ever – was not even a gleam in the eye of its founder, Boardman’s then-coach Peter Keen; it began life five years later. Storey’s Paralympic debut is that long ago that when she first pulled on GB kit, Lance Armstrong was not even a professional cyclist, Miguel Indurain was in his prime, Kelloggs and the Milk Marketing Board still sponsored cycling Tours of Britain, and in the political world, Tony Blair as prime minister was a remote prospect.

Ireland’s data privacy watchdog has slapped WhatsApp with a record €225m (£193m) fine for violating EU data protection rules.
The Dublin-based Data Protection Commission (DPC) announced the decision on Thursday after a three-year investigation into the messaging app, which is owned by Facebook. It ordered WhatsApp to remedy its policies to protect personal data.

                    <span>The expansion of drylands is leaving entire countries facing famine. It’s time to change the way we think about agriculture

David R Montgomery is professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington, and author of Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations and Growing a Revolution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life

This summer’s record-setting heatwaves and dramatic fires in southern Europe and the American west were stark reminders that the climate crisis has arrived. But as the world warms, there is also a quieter, lesser-known crisis unfolding underfoot. Desertification, long seen primarily as a threat to developing nations, is coming for Europe and North America too, as worsening droughts bake soils already degraded by conventional farming and grazing practices.
In Spain, for example, about a fifth of all land is now at high risk of desertification, as is much of the agricultural land across Italy, Greece, and western North America.

The new editor of Britain’s only black national newspaper has warned the UK is going backwards in recognising institutional racism in the media and wider society.
Lester Holloway, who was announced on Thursday as editor of the Voice, said the original statement by the Society of Editors that the UK media was not racist or bigoted, and which strongly disputed claims the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s negative coverage was motivated by racism, was part of a wider “regression” in recognising and tackling racial inequality.

As the rear door closed and the deafening engines started, lifting the heavy plane off the runway at Kabul’s international airport, people broke down wailing; crying. Now refugees.

“Broadcast and TV institutions must not screen idol development programmes or variety shows and reality shows that feature the children of celebrities,” China’s broadcast regulator, the National Radio and Television Administration said, in new regulations announced on Thursday.

Inspirational to the last, Ellie Simmonds concluded her Paralympic career in Tokyo on Thursday without a ninth medal to add to her haul from Beijing, London and Rio, but confident too that teammates who were motivated by her own achievements “are now inspiring the next generation”.
Simmonds was initially disqualified from fifth place in the women’s 400m freestyle S6 for not touching the wall on her second turn, but reinstated following an appeal. It was the last of her three finals in Tokyo, following a fourth place behind teammate Maisie Summers-Newton in the 100m breaststroke and fifth in the 200m individual medley.

Exports of food and drink to the EU have suffered a “disastrous” decline in the first half of the year because of Brexit trade barriers, with sales of beef and cheese hit hardest.
Food and Drink Federation (FDF) producers lost £2bn in sales, a dent in revenue that could not be compensated for by the increased sales in the same period to non-EU countries including China and Australia.

Jones had said on Tuesday he was “not happy”; he had not come to Tokyo to miss out on the podium. No doubt that reality was sinking in as he trudged his trike up the final hill of Thursday’s T1-2 road race.

                    <span>Sitting the exam had been completely routine, but I soon realised grammar school would be a major turning point
My most memorable day was the morning I came to primary school knowing I had passed my 11-plus and would be going to grammar school: Harrow County Grammar School for Girls. I knew the 11-plus was important, but had no idea how pivotal it was to be. Taking the exam was completely routine. Nobody I knew had special tuition for it – or if they did, I didn’t know about it. 
Although my parents were devout Labour voters, the debate about grammar schools had passed them by. They had no idea that good socialists were not supposed to send their children to grammar school, let alone sit the 11-plus. Like generations of immigrants before them, and generations still to come, they believed passionately in education. Education was the means by which we, the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation, would fulfil our parents’ dreams and aspirations. So, if going to grammar school meant you got a good education, my parents believed that it must be a good thing.

                    <span>As the rubber bullets and teargas flew during last year’s protests, an epidemic of ‘less lethal’ shootings inspired a network of survivors
My mind raced in the seconds after I was shot.
I heard the gun go off and turned my head toward the sound, just in time to watch the spinning aluminum canister slam into my brow. Everything went black. I stumbled. When I regained my balance and opened my eyes, the sight in my right eye was gone. Something in my head told me the teargas canister was the last thing I’d ever see clearly.

                    <span>When we find it difficult to say ‘no’ at work or at home, our responsibilities can quickly become overwhelming. For good mental health, focusing on our own needs and capabilities is crucial
No. A tiny, yet mighty word. To hear it can make us feel childlike; sheepish or in trouble. How does it make you feel to say “no”? Strong? Nervous? Guilty? Do you say it often enough?
In July, when the gymnast Simone Biles withdrew from most of her Olympics appearances, citing emotional exhaustion that was affecting her ability to perform, her “no” was a thunderbolt. Reactions were largely supportive, but opinions were divided along political lines in the US. White, male sports pundits (and, predictable as the arrow of time, Piers Morgan) used the word “selfish”. It was a similar story when the tennis player Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open in May, speaking of “long bouts of depression” and “huge waves of anxiety” before her pre- and post-match press conferences.

                    <span>There’s a century of toxic sludge hiding in the Gowanus Canal, but it may not be enough to stop a mega-developer from building on it
In November, gigantic yellow excavators began scooping up the poisonous sludge colloquially known as “black mayonnaise” from the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York – a momentous step in a prolonged cleanup effort, 10 years after the waterway’s designation as a Superfund site.
But the mood is bittersweet. Longtime residents who campaigned for the Superfund label say they are now facing another environmental battle: a proposed mega-development in the neighborhood that would sit on top of a century’s worth of toxic chemicals.

More than a decade ago, Adam Bowen and James Monsees became friends over their smoke breaks at Stanford University. They were graduate students when they first conceived of the idea behind Juul: conventional cigarettes, like the ones they couldn’t stop smoking, were bad not because of nicotine, but for all the other chemicals from burnt tar.
The pair had a vision: design a device that would deliver solely nicotine, offer a better experience for smokers and help those who wanted to quit cigarettes.

In Nhlangano, in the south of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), the illegal farming of the mountainous kingdom’s famous “Swazi gold” is a risk many grandmothers are ready to take.
In what is known locally as the “gardens of Eden”, a generation of grandparents are growing cannabis, many of them sole carers for some of the many children orphaned by the HIV/Aids epidemic that gripped southern Africa.

                    <span>The year 2020 exposed the risks and weaknesses of the market-driven global system like never before. It’s hard to avoid the sense that a turning point has been reached
If one word could sum up the experience of 2020, it would be disbelief. Between Xi Jinping’s public acknowledgment of the coronavirus outbreak on 20 January 2020, and Joe Biden’s inauguration as the 46th president of the United States precisely a year later, the world was shaken by a disease that in the space of 12 months killed more than 2.2 million people and rendered tens of millions severely ill. Today the official death tolls stands at 4.51 million. The likely figure for excess deaths is more than twice that number. The virus disrupted the daily routine of virtually everyone on the planet, stopped much of public life, closed schools, separated families, interrupted travel and upended the world economy.
To contain the fallout, government support for households, businesses and markets took on dimensions not seen outside wartime. It was not just by far the sharpest economic recession experienced since the second world war, it was qualitatively unique. Never before had there been a collective decision, however haphazard and uneven, to shut large parts of the world’s economy down. It was, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) put it, “a crisis like no other”.

Jules White and Nicola Davis have done their homework
For most people, it’s been hard enough managing the logistics of their own pandemic. For Jules White, it’s been on a whole other scale. He’s the headteacher of Tanbridge House school in Surrey, and as well as remembering his own mask, he’s been in charge of more than 1,500 pupils and 150 staff. As his school and others across England and Wales come back this week, he explains the challenges of managing a return to the classroom, and the struggles and rewards of helping pupils do their best in the most complicated of circumstances.
Nosheen Iqbal is also joined by the Guardian’s science correspondent, Nicola Davis, who sets out the latest evidence and advice on issues including the rates of transmission and serious illness among children, the pros and cons of vaccinating teenagers, and whether we should be concerned about a reported rise in coronavirus cases linked to schools going back in Scotland.

A shooting at a North Carolina high school on Wednesday has left one student dead and authorities have taken a suspect into custody, officials said.
The police chief of Winston-Salem, Catrina Thompson, told a news conference while fighting back tears that Mount Tabor high school had gone into immediate lockdown as emergency responders, sheriff’s deputies and police officers arrived just after noon to search for the suspect, who she said was believed to be a student at the school.

Footfall in UK high streets and retail parks last month hit its highest level since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as increased domestic tourism boosted consumer activity.
Data from the retail tracker Springboard found the number of consumers visiting bricks-and-mortar shopping outlets rose by a quarter in August, helped by people choosing to take holidays at home this summer.

Total spending per pupil in England was just over £6,500 in the latest complete year of data in 2019-20, a fall of 9% in real terms compared with its high point of £7,200 in 2009-10, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Scrapping free prescription charges for people over 60 and raising the qualifying age to 66 could have a devastating impact on the health of tens of thousands of older people, new analysis by Age UK suggests.
In a joint open letter urging the government to reconsider proposals to scrap free prescriptions for over-60s in England, 20 healthcare organisations expressed “deep shared concerns” that the move would leave many patients unable to afford medication, intensifying existing health inequalities and having a devastating impact on some older people’s health.

The signatories said the prime minister’s claim to be on the side of families hit financially by the pandemic would be revealed as superficial if he pressed ahead with the cut, which would push an estimated 500,000 people into poverty.

Jadon Sancho a doubt for Thursday’s World Cup qualifier

Gareth Southgate has called for focus and humility when England visit Hungary in World Cup qualifying on Thursday night, telling his team not to start “swanning around” after their exploits at Euro 2020.
England’s manager has put to one side the pain of losing on penalties to Italy in the final of the Euros and is thinking about how to reach even greater heights. Southgate said that nothing other than winning next year’s World Cup in Qatar would do after the near-miss against Italy and he believes that will be possible only if his players steer clear of complacency.

                    <span>Cristiano Ronaldo just would not be denied. He had a penalty saved by Gavin Bazunu and then saw John Egan put the Republic of Ireland on course for what would have been a famous and deserved victory. But Manchester United’s newest signing struck twice in the dying minutes to give his country victory and prolong his own legend, a pair of majestic headers making him the most prolific scorer in the history of men’s international football.
Ronaldo took his goal tally from 180 matches for his country to 111, two more than Ali Daei scored for Iran – and 102 more than the combined haul of Ireland’s starting XI on the Algarve. Ronaldo’s extraordinary feat made for an agonising end for the Ireland manager, Stephen Kenny, whose team delivered an intelligent and confident performance, proving they have made serious progress since losing at home to Luxembourg in March. Ireland have zero points from three qualifiers, and Kenny has one win from 14 matches in charge, but there was plenty of reason here to believe they are going in the right direction. There is no shame in being thwarted by the greatest scorer of all time.

Beaumont hits superb 97 from 65 balls

England reclaimed Fortress Chelmsford with a vengeance, hitting their highest T20 score against New Zealand – 184 for four – before bowling out their opponents for 138 in 18.5 overs to finish with a huge 46-run win.
Two years ago, England were subject to an onslaught from the mighty Meg Lanning here. Tammy Beaumont’s 97 from 65 balls – her fourth half-century of the international summer – meant England doled out a taste of that same medicine.

Dan Evans has achieved a fair few notable wins at the US Open over the years and it is undoubtedly the grand slam tournament where he most reliably produces his best tennis, but after a summer disrupted by testing positive for Covid-19, his journey to the third round for the fourth time must surely be the most satisfying runs of his time spent in New York.
In an afternoon ravaged by rain and the looming threat of Hurricane Ida, Dan Evans navigated multiple disruptions to defeat home favourite Marcos Giron 6-4, 7-6 (3), 2-6, 6-3 and advance.

There is only one way out of the Golden Bear neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe, and as the flames of the Caldor fire crept closer on Monday that could easily have turned into a catastrophe.
But as the fire bore down on the neighborhood, a cluster of a couple of hundred homes tucked into the conifer-covered mountainside near the famous California lake, residents didn’t panic. They packed.

“Fit for the future” published by a 1,200-strong network called Labour in Communications, urges Starmer to slim down the shadow cabinet and give a more prominent role to well-respected Labour leaders from around the UK.

Top Democrats across the country are condemning the US supreme court over its silence on Texas’s latest and most extreme abortion law to date after it came into effect on Wednesday.
The so-called “Heartbeat Act”, which was signed into law by Greg Abbott, the state’s Republican governor, in May, bans abortions at six weeks and does not make exceptions for incest and rape. Furthermore, it empowers private citizens to sue any abortion provider who violates the law.

Reddit has banned a discussion forum that spreads misinformation about coronavirus and vaccines after a user rebellion over the site’s failure to tackle Covid sceptics.
The online discussion site acted after 135 Reddit communities, or subreddits, announced they had “gone dark”, a move that blocks non-members from reading or joining the page, in protest at the site’s refusal to limit discussions that propagate misleading theories about the pandemic.

                    <span>Foreign secretary, previously known for saying too much, now is vague and unreactive
A therapist once introduced me to a strategy which I’ll paraphrase as “boring on purpose” – when someone’s speaking, and you find your mind wandering, the fault may not be yours. It could be that they’re being repetitive, vague, unreactive, wadding each sentence with generalities like cavity wall insulation, for a reason: to resist the intimacy of your full attention, to divert you from whatever it is they don’t want to discuss. If it’s a useful tactic in everyday life, that’s nothing on its deployment in front of a select committee.
Dominic Raab was previously known for his pugnacity, prone to saying more than he meant to, in irritation. That trait has been ironed out in whatever word-management course ministers are now obliged to attend, and the foreign affairs select committee, chaired by Tom Tugendhat, was treated to an altogether different man – quietly monotonous, defeatist without being penitent, trotting out the same rote phrases like a copy-and-paste job from the clipboard remnants of his bleached out personality.

                    <span>The producer whose TV hits include The Royle Family and Gavin and Stacey on finding the poignancy in life’s little moments, and heading back to the comedy circuit with his poetry
Comedians become actors, pop stars become TV presenters … we’re used to artists switching lanes. Seldom travelled, though, is the road leading from performance poetry to TV producing – TV producers not being renowned for their poetic souls. It may be that Henry Normal is the only poet to make that journey, and he did it with spectacular success, co-running the production company Baby Cow with Steve Coogan, creating hit after hit (Gavin and Stacey, The Mighty Boosh, Nighty Night) across a 17-year run. But the siren call of spoken word proved impossible to resist: Normal quit producing five years ago and is now prepping a standup poetry tour.
“It’s the biggest tour I’ve ever done,” he tells me, Zooming from his native Nottingham. “I toured with Caroline Aherne and Steve back in the day. I’ve done over 1,000 gigs in my life. But an actual theatre tour, where it’s me doing a full show by myself? That’s very much a big deal for me.” The tour, called The Escape Plan, will feature work from his two lockdown-era collections, The Beauty Within Shadow and The Distance Between Clouds, as well as material from the BBC Radio 4 shows that began in 2016 with A Normal Family. “It’s a mixture of stories and comedy, jokes and poems,” he says. “It’s basically 64 years in the making, and I’m hoping to pack it all into just under two hours.”

Not this time. The fourth Test against India that starts on Thursday will not decide a series that is locked at 1‑1 and still has a finale in Manchester next week. As for selection, uncertainty still reigns over quarantine requirements for the Ashes and thus which players will make themselves available.

When artists choose to deal with the black liberation movement, it’s most often the legacy: the freedoms, the historical posters, the imagery. But it’s the present, as the artist and activist Sophia Dawson tells the Guardian, that is just as tragic.
“I used to sleep in my African American history class,” she says. “I didn’t want to sleep in the class, it’s just a side-effect of being pregnant. [My professor] used to show films … But then, one day, she talked about this documentary, and it had to do with the Black Panther party so it piqued my interest. So, I was like, ‘Let me try to stay up today’ and that was when I learned of the term political prisoner. I wasn’t familiar with that part of history.”

On Monday night, the adventurers became the first people to walk the longest straight line in the UK without crossing a paved road, after spending four days crossing 78.55km (48.8 miles) from the Pass of Drumochter to Corgarff in north Scotland.

                    <span>Dominic Raab grilled by foreign affairs select committee over why he did not act on  risk assessment
The UK Foreign Office’s own risk assessment warned that the Taliban could return rapidly to power, causing cities to collapse and triggering a humanitarian crisis, less than four weeks before the fall of Kabul.
Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, told MPs on Wednesday that he believed the Afghan capital would remain safe until next year based on an assessment by the joint intelligence committee, a view he said was widely shared by Nato allies.

                    <span>Award for the best new black and minority ethnic writers in the UK goes to Zimbabwe-born author for his story of a boy meeting his father for the first time 

Read The Ritual Seat of the King by Gift Nyoni below

Gift Nyoni has won the 2021 4thWrite prize for his short story The Ritual Seat of the King, a “wise, subtle and intimate” look at how the life of a young boy changes as the Rhodesian civil war comes to an end.
The Zimbabwe-born Nyoni’s winning entry follows David, a boy whose father has been absent for years, and whose mother has been receiving “visitors” in his absence. After the war ends, and Rhodesia becomes Zimbabwe, his father returns home but his homecoming is not what David anticipated. Nyoni, a trainee solicitor at a London firm, beat five other shortlisted authors, including Sulaxana Hippisley and Laura Blake, to win the award, which is run jointly by the Guardian and publisher 4th Estate. It aims to find the best new writers from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds based in the UK.

                    <span>The 2.1% rise cited by Nationwide was likely to be due to cheap loans and a desire to get out of cities
More evidence that Rishi Sunak’s pandemic freebie for homebuyers was a waste of money: even when the stamp duty holiday was partly removed, house prices continued to fly. The 2.1% rise in August, on the Nationwide’s readings, was the second largest monthly increase in 15 years.
It all suggests the 13% rise in house prices since the start of the pandemic had little to do with Sunak’s subsidies. The Resolution Foundation thinktank reached that conclusion in a persuasive analysis last week, arguing that the big drivers were low interest rates – a proven catalyst – plus accumulated lockdown savings and the desire among some buyers to get out of cities in search of more space. That account rings true. The housing market did not need support and Sunak did not have to let an estimated £4.4bn in tax receipts slip between the cracks.

Half a million people in the UK who have severely weakened immune systems are to be offered third shots of Covid vaccines in an effort to improve their protection against the disease.
So what is the advice, who is eligible, and where does this leave plans for an autumn booster programme?

Pupils in England could be put on a “glide path” back to pre-pandemic exam grading over the next two years, as the government prepares to unveil plans to avoid a sudden drop in national A-level and GCSE results awarded from 2022 onwards.
Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, is said to be aiming for a “soft landing” in the overall distribution of grades that pupils receive in returning to the system last used in 2019, before the grade acceleration seen in 2020 and 2021 when formal exams were replaced by teacher assessment.

Billionaires were probably not part of the plan for the founders of the Chinese Communist party. Nevertheless, extraordinary economic growth has meant that more than 1,000 of its citizens had fortunes worth more than $1bn this year, according to one measure – the first time any country has achieved that mark.
Under Xi Jinping, China’s patience with the ultra-wealthy has now run out, with the president pursuing a “common prosperity” agenda to tackle inequality – humbling some of the world’s richest people and triggering them into a flood of donations.

When judging a government’s performance in a crisis, there is a distinction to be drawn between control and responsibility. No British minister could have stopped the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. But there was time for contingency planning between that unilateral US policy being declared in February 2020 and its completion last month. Dominic Raab could not control the Taliban’s advance on Kabul, but that does not excuse him from responsibility for a chaotic and incomplete evacuation.
In an appearance before a parliamentary select committee on Wednesday, the foreign secretary sought cover behind intelligence assessments predicting a slower decay of the situation in Afghanistan, with the capital not falling this year.

                    <span>He would have been 100 this week, yet so much of Raymond Williams’s writing speaks directly to our politics
He was born 100 years ago this week in the Welsh village of Pandy, just outside the market town of Abergavenny, and smack on the border with England. And borders were to become one of Raymond Williams’s key subjects. In all kinds of senses: borders of space and time and class and in personal relationships. Yet what made Williams one of 20th century Britain’s most important cultural critics was his refusal to take any of these boundaries as unchanging and fixed. The son of a railway signalman got a scholarship to Cambridge, was sent to fight in the invasion of Normandy in 1944, before ending his days in the 1980s writing novels about the Black Mountains as often as not from his home in Essex. He moved about politically, too, starting in the Communist party and ending in Plaid Cymru. Often ranked, rightly, among Wales’s greatest writers, he had a lot to say about place without ever being narrowly parochial or dogmatic.
His early masterpiece The Country and the City opens by observing that the “contrast between country and city, as fundamental ways of life, reaches back into classical times” – before swiftly tearing down that divide by taking the reader through 400 years of English literature and showing how these two supposed archetypes changed meaning and association again and again. In the wake of the Brexit vote, politicians and scholars have paid attention to place like rarely before, jawing on about the “Red Wall”, “left-behind places”, “Cambridge versus Clacton” and any number of other brittle stereotypes that are crying out for a Williams-style demolition.

Up to one in seven children who test positive for coronavirus could still have symptoms linked to the disease three months later, according to a study that suggests the prevalence of long Covid in young people is lower than initially feared.
The analysis, led by University College London and Public Health England researchers, drew on survey responses from nearly 7,000 11- to 17-year-olds who underwent PCR tests between January and March. Of these, 3,065 tested positive and 3,739 tested negative.

Speaking to me from his home in Brussels, the permanently baseball-capped Martin says: “It was like warfare. There were people barricading doors.

Half a million people with severely weakened immune systems are to be offered third Covid vaccine shots in a move that will increase debate over the rollout of booster jabs for the wider population.
The NHS will provide third doses for those aged 12 and up who have severely compromised or suppressed immune systems at a time decided by their clinicians. It follows a recommendation on Wednesday from the government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

I don’t even know how you could define victory there, unless it is getting out alive.”
Galloway spoke from long experience with untenable wars. He began in Vietnam, where, in the Americans’ first major battle of that war, at Ia Drang in 1965, he became the only civilian awarded a Bronze Star medal, for rescuing a wounded soldier while under fire.

On 24 June, Nizar Banat, a longtime activist and outspoken critic of the Palestinian Authority (PA), was reportedly arrested and beaten outside his cousin’s home in Hebron by the authority’s security forces – he died in custody shortly after. In regular videos recorded and posted to his social media accounts, Banat often took the Palestinian Authority to task for its corruption, lack of democratic practice and collaboration with Israel. A few days prior to his death, he had uploaded a video in which he accused the authority of selling out the Palestinian struggle.

                    <span>South of UK was duller and wetter than usual, while extreme weather hit hard across the world

Glasgow, the host city of the crucial Cop26 UN climate summit in November, has experienced its hottest summer on record, the Met Office has said.
Scotland also recorded the highest UK temperature in August – 27.2C (80.9F) recorded at Tyndrum – breaking a run of 20 years during which England had the hottest day. The summer was unusually dry in Scotland as well, with just 62% of average rainfall.

Elton John has announced the imminent release of a new album he made during the coronavirus lockdowns, with an array of A-list guests who contributed remotely or while maintaining social distancing.
The Lockdown Sessions, released on 22 October, features contributions from Dua Lipa, Stevie Wonder, Lil Nas X, Stevie Nicks, Gorillaz, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, rappers Young Thug and Nicki Minaj, country singer Brandi Carlile and more.

Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London

The “great replacement” – the conspiracy theory that globalist elites are planning to supplant the white population of Europe with Muslim and/or black migrants – was originally formulated by the French white nationalist writer Renaud Camus.
Not unusually, what French history turns into tragedy – the theory inspired the Christchurch mass murderer, Brenton Tarrant – British history prefigures as farce. As far back as the end of the 19th century, the Conservative MP Arthur Brookfield’s “political satire” Simiocracy described how a Liberal government, determined to entrench itself in power, extended the franchise to gorillas, millions of whom arrived from Borneo.

                    <span>My backlog of prestige shows grows bigger by the day - I have still only watched three series of Mad Men. But Don Draper’s existential crisis can’t compete with Married at First Sight UK
Rewatching The Sopranos was fun for a year, sure. But, as a successful-if-boring series of Love Island proved, normal TV is back again – and with it the compulsive urge to watch it. This year has taught me that there is a near-limitless stock of prestige TV I haven’t got round to yet (I am only three series into Mad Men. Mad Men!), but the allure still clings to the rhythmic, the medicinal, the brain-off glossy stuff that wastes an hour of your life without making you think.
After weeks of watching Love Island, half against my will, E4 has this week had the temerity to put out a different daily reality bingefest, Married at First Sight UK. I already know I am going to watch every episode of that at 9pm instead of seeing what nice suit Don Draper is wearing during his semi-silent personal crisis. I simply cannot be bothered to watch good TV any more.

The emotive language of Gaby Hinsliff’s article (What a story to tell the world: Britain values dogs more than Afghan people, 30 August) not only risks deflecting attention from the consequences of the reactive, rather than proactive, response of the British government, but also suggests that one cannot care equally about the victims of humanitarian crises and the plight of other innocent species in manmade conflicts.
Accordingly, “human souls” are pitted against a “menagerie of strays”, whose lives a former soldier in Afghanistan and his Afghan staff valued enough to wish to save at the risk of their own survival. Ms Hinsliff is no doubt correct in noting that cats are “of no conceivable interest to the Taliban”, so what fate does she imagine awaited these animals under the new rulers of the country?

                    <span>Giving low-paid workers a decent increase will make very little difference, writes Dr Robert Nicholls
I fully agree with Larry Elliott (So what’s so wrong with labour shortages driving up low wages?’, 29 August) and take issue with your correspondent (Letters, 30 August). As a former wages inspector, I well remember Margaret Thatcher and other rightwingers’ arguments for the abolition of the wages councils that set minimum rates in traditionally low-paid and usually non-unionised industries. Their arguments were basically the same – that it would increase inflation.
It is surprising to me that so many people who I suspect consider themselves to be leftwing are opposed to poorly paid workers improving their pay. Inflation does not have to be a consequence of increased pay. When the wages councils introduced yearly pay increases, there was no subsequent increase in inflation. This was because the rates were still quite low compared to the average pay rates throughout the country as a whole. The decision to abolish the wages councils was purely ideological on the part of the government. We have legal minimum rates at the moment without any detrimental effects on inflation, and giving low-paid workers a decent increase will make very little difference.

                    <span>With help from mouse-turned-footman James Corden and a genderqueer fairy godparent, Camila Cabello’s Ella gets to go to the ball in an outfit of her own creation
This musical Cinderella’s stodgy online trailer fluffed the snark glands of social media, with its warbly American Idol-style cover versions and the presence of producer-actor James Corden in a comedy mouse-turned-footman supporting role. There may even have been some unkind overexcitement at the thought of a new Cats-level debacle. But no. Actually, writer-director Kay Cannon’s new Cinderella isn’t bad, and Camila Cabello makes a rather personable lead, carrying off some of the movie’s generous helping of funny lines. Doesn’t she want to go to the ball, testily inquires genderqueer fairy godparent Fab G, played by Billy Porter. “Yes, I was just crying and singing about it,” says Cinderella thoughtfully.
Cinderella lives in a quaint Disney-National-Trust village in a vast cottage with her horrid step- (not “ugly”, please) sisters Anastasia (Maddie Baillio) and Drizella (Charlotte Spencer) and fierce stepmother Vivian (Idina Menzel), whose own revisionist third-act redemption is visible a mile away. (They surely missed a trick by not calling her a “conservator”.) Our heroine is actually called Ella: her association with “cinders” is explained, but she never has to scrape out a real fire, nor is one ever lit.

The 25-year-old from the Scottish borders fell just short of a medal in her Paralympic debut five years ago, but will return home with a bronze this time after a strong showing in the 100m, finishing in 16.53sec – a quarter of a second behind the winner, China’s Gao Fang.

Boris Johnson’s decision to dispatch a senior spy chief to talk directly to the Taliban in Qatar reflects an uncomfortable but necessary reality: the UK has little option but to engage with the insurgent group now in control of Afghanistan.
Thousands of Afghans eligible for resettlement in the UK are believed to remain trapped in the country – UK ministers refuse to say how many – and hundreds of British nationals. With western troops withdrawn, it is only with Taliban cooperation that people will be able to leave safely and smoothly.

Israel has said a US plan to reopen its consulate in Jerusalem that was traditionally a base for diplomatic outreach to Palestinians is a “bad idea” and could destabilise the prime minister’s new government.
The previous US administration of Donald Trump signalled support for Israel’s claim on Jerusalem as its capital by moving its embassy there from Tel Aviv and subsuming the consulate in that mission.

A leading race equality thinktank did not breach charity guidance despite claims from Conservative MPs that it is pursuing a political agenda, a watchdog has found.
The Charity Commission’s review of the Runnymede Trust concluded that the charity was allowed to engage with the government’s report on racial disparities in the UK and it did not breach its legal duties and responsibilities in its participation in judicial review proceedings.

Some people have called him the Lionel Messi of his sport, but David Smith prefers to style himself as the Ronnie O’Sullivan of boccia. “I like to be creative, I like to put on a show, I like to play well,” he said, though there is a caveat to the comparison. “I prefer to win, so I get you could put me in that camp but I’m probably unlike Ronnie and more like [Cristiano] Ronaldo in that, if I have to dig it out I will.”
Dig it out he did on Wednesday afternoon as Smith retained his BC1 Paralympic title, coming back from two points down to win the gold-medal match against Malaysia’s Chew Wei Lun 4-2.

The piece (called Great Redistribution of the Climate Change Disaster) did enough to convince a buyer – confusingly named Pranksy – to pay the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of pounds only to have the currency returned after what appeared to be an elaborate hoax by a scammer.

“Perfect,” says Seana Ruddick. Her single word tells the surgeon Sam Oussedik that the robot-assisted knee replacement he is performing is going well. He is removing the joint using a combination of old-school tools – a hammer and chisel – and cutting-edge technology – the saw blade of a Mako robot. It is a noisy and smelly process. Viewing is not for the weak of stomach.
Ruddick, a Mako specialist, is Oussedik’s guide as he works in an operating theatre in one of the five below-ground levels of the Grafton Way Building, a 13-storey new extension to University College hospital in central London.

Without help for oil-producing countries, net zero by 2050 is a distant dream

 The finance minister of Iraq, one of the founding members of the global oil cartel Opec, has made an unprecedented call to fellow oil producers to move away from fossil fuel dependency and into renewable energy, ahead of a key Opec meeting.
Ali Allawi, who is also the deputy prime minister of Iraq, has written in the Guardian to urge oil producers to pursue “an economic renewal focused on environmentally sound policies and technologies” that would include solar power and potentially nuclear reactors, and reduce their dependency on fossil fuel exports.

International Paralympic Committee spokesman Craig Spence said Zolkefli and two others who did not reach the podium were allowed to compete under protest after they failed to appear on time for the event.

A World Health Organization “pandemic intelligence hub” launched by the UN agency’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Germany’s Angela Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday will try to help governments identify future pandemics at an earlier stage and improve monitoring of new variant strains of Covid-19.
The hub, which will host scientists and policymakers from around the globe on a project-by-project basis, is designed to make it easier for governments to compare notes on emerging infectious diseases and pull in additional relevant information on travel patterns, trade routes or human-animal interactions in agriculture.

                    <span>To meet climate targets and avoid economic collapse, countries such as Iraq need international support in the transition to clean energy
• Ali Allawi is deputy prime minister and finance minister of Iraq. Fatih Birol is executive director of the International Energy Agency
In the Middle East and north Africa, global warming is not a distant threat, but an already painful reality. Rising temperatures are exacerbating water shortages. In Iraq, temperatures are estimated to be rising as much as seven times faster than the global average. Countries in this region are not only uniquely affected by global temperature rises: their centrality to global oil and gas markets makes their economies particularly vulnerable to the transition away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources. It’s essential the voices of Iraq and similar countries are heard at the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow this November.
To stand a chance of limiting the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it produces and consumes energy, burning less coal, oil and natural gas. The International Energy Agency’s recent global roadmap to net zero by 2050 shows the world’s demand for oil will need to decline from more than 90m barrels a day to less than 25m by 2050. This would result in a 75% plunge in net revenues for oil-producing economies, many of which are dominated by a public sector that relies on oil exports and the revenues they produce.

My husband and I have been together for 16 years and have two kids. He recently told me he’s bisexual. I was  shocked and feel uncomfortable thinking of him having sex with men. I am not homophobic, but I just didn’t think my husband liked men. After asking him if he has urges he needs to fulfil, he said maybe bisexual was the wrong word and that he’s just attracted to the male physique. I feel like now he’s not being completely honest. I’m also worried that he will want to have sex with men and not want me as much. 
It is never easy for a person to come out, and it can be equally hard for a partner to learn that his sexual orientation may be different from what it seemed. Try not to “catastrophise” this situation. Your partner married you, and you have so far been confident about his desire for you. Nothing has really changed – he has simply tried to share something important about who he truly is. Whether he will want to act on his interest in men is a separate matter that may need to be discussed and negotiated at some later point and I understand that that may seem threatening to you.

“Life is a combination of magic – and pasta,” the Italian film director Federico Fellini once said. And if, like me, you’re a devoted pastaphile, you’ll almost certainly agree with Fellini’s worldview.
For something so very simple – at its base, pasta consists of just two, sometimes three, ingredients: always water and flour made from 100% durum wheat; while egg can be added to make a richer pasta. It has spawned a myriad of recipes, ranging from the easy to the elaborate.

                    <span>The FBI’s inadequate response to far-right violence results from a lack of will, not a lack of legal authority
On 6 January, a mob including white supremacists and far-right militants stormed the US Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Joe Biden’s election victory. The attack followed mass shootings by white supremacists – like in El Paso in 2019 and a Pittsburgh synagogue the year before – and relatively unpoliced public violence by far-right militants at rallies across the country since Donald Trump’s election.
The Biden administration now seeks to turn the attention of the post-9/11 counterterrorism enterprise toward “domestic violent extremists”. But in making this shift, it is vital that we learn from our mistakes rather than simply repeating them. Already officials are headed down the same problematic path we took 20 years ago, considering proposals to expand counterterrorism authorities and using ideology as an indicator of potential violence.

                    <span>Ben John, former Leicester student who downloaded white supremacist documents, given suspended jail sentence
A former student who downloaded almost 70,000 white supremacist documents and bomb-making instructions has avoided a prison sentence “by the skin of his teeth” after being told to read classic literature by Dickens, Austen, Shakespeare and Hardy.
Ben John, 21, from Lincoln, a former student at De Montfort University in Leicester, has to return to court every four months to be tested on his reading, Judge Timothy Spencer QC said. He also sentenced him to a suspended two years’ imprisonment plus a further two years on licence.

                    <span>Daphne was a starving stray who became a loving family pet. When the dogcatcher gave chase, I realised the entire school was rooting for my dog
The dog had followed us to school, a walk of about half a mile. This was not unusual – the dog followed us to school almost every day. Generally, she would sit in the playground for a while before going back home. Sometimes she stayed to interfere with games. On at least one occasion, she entered the building and wandered the halls until she found my brother’s classroom.
My father had picked up this dog as a starving stray outside his office a couple of years earlier. It was black with orange marks where eyebrows would be; skinny, highly strung, loyal and ungovernable. My father named her Daphne.

Have you faced sanitation issues? We want to hear from you


On a cold winter morning early this year, Mary Hill was helping her 101-year-old mother get ready for the day when she received a distressing email alert. Tens of millions of gallons of raw sewage were heading for her prized family oyster beds.
Yet Hill was not surprised that the wastewater pipe built in the 1940s had succumbed to corrosion. “Here we go again,” she thought grimly.

Los Angeles has seen volatile protests almost every weekend this summer over trans rights, political opposition to masks and vaccines, and the recall of the Democratic governor. At least seven journalists have been physically assaulted while covering these rallies, six of them by rightwing demonstrators.
Attacks on the press are just one part of escalating rightwing street violence in the city, which has included multiple stabbings, people being sprayed in the face with bear Mace, an assault on a breast cancer patient outside a clinic, and repeated physical brawls with leftwing protesters in the streets. In another sign of growing tensions, protesters rallying against vaccine mandates showed up at the homes of two Los Angeles city council members on Sunday.

From lynx making a comeback to a striking ecological disaster and narwhal shrimp communicating at great depths, there is an incredible range in the unique and fascinating images in the Natural History Museum’s exhibition. The photographs are a compelling reminder of the importance of the variety and variability of life on Earth in securing the future of our planet, revealed just ahead of the first phase of the global UN conference of Cop15 on biodiversity.

                    <span>Previously a niche, expensive product, period knickers are now readily available on the UK high street. Women explain why they are turning their backs on single-use pads and tampons
It was December 2020 and Janet (not her real name), a 53-year-old IT consultant from Edinburgh, was doing her weekly shop in the Sainsbury’s closest to her house. In went the toilet roll, meat and vegetables. She wheeled her trolley on to the feminine hygiene aisle and saw a pair of period knickers. They were £12.
Janet frowned and considered. She had heard about period underwear; a friend raved about her Thinx. Janet had even been on the Thinx website, but the cheapest pair, with delivery, were more than £30. “It was quite a lot of money if I didn’t like them,” she says. She was doubtful that the knickers would even work for someone who was perimenopausal and had recently gone back to using sanitary towels for the first time since she was a teenager because she found it too uncomfortable to wear a tampon.

Spain’s growing energy cooperative movement has received a boost after the government announced that some of the latest allocation of renewable energy will be in small lots, rather than large tranches that only big energy companies can afford.
The move signals a change of attitude after successive governments have given in to the demands of the power giants.

Listen to our podcast: Can we really solve the climate crisis by planting trees? – part one

Thomas Crowther understands more than most the danger of simple, optimistic messages about combating the climate crisis. In July 2019, the British ecologist co-authored a study estimating that Earth had space for an extra trillion trees on land not used for agriculture or settlement. Its implications were intoxicatingly hopeful. By restoring forests in an area roughly the size of China, the press release accompanying the paper suggested two-thirds of all emissions from human activities still present in the atmosphere could be removed. 
The study, led by Jean-François Bastin, a postdoctoral researcher at Crowther’s lab in ETH Zürich, Switzerland, was the second most featured climate paper in the media in 2019, according to one analysis. It inspired the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) One Trillion Trees Initiative, launched last year after Salesforce billionaire Marc Benioff read the paper on the recommendation of Al Gore, the former US vice-president. The Time magazine owner told everyone he could about the research: chief executives, friends and world leaders, even convincing climate sceptic Donald Trump to back the WEF initiative with a multibillion tree commitment.

I was in a Pret in Cambridge city centre when I got the call: the senior tutor of my college, Pembroke, told me I had to come and see him. I was needed urgently back in London for a family emergency, and he would drive me to the train station.
It was an October morning, 2016, and I was about to go to a lecture. But my heart sank in that moment: it was the kind of call that can only signal tragedy. My father had a heart condition – cardiomyopathy – and I knew that the offer to take me to the station meant he was certainly dead.

                    <span>Stress can feel like a baseline condition for many of us – especially during a pandemic. But there are ways to help alleviate the very worst of it, whether through support, sleep or radical self-care
At a time when all life’s challenges have been amplified by the pandemic – and awareness of burnout, at home and at work, has never been higher – stress might seem to be our baseline condition. For most of us, these periods of pressure pass relatively quickly. Even serious stress can be temporary and, given the chance to recover, we usually will. “But emotional resilience won’t solve everything,” says Rachel Boyd, from the mental health charity Mind. “Some of the causes of stress are very challenging to cope with, even when we feel OK.”
Many of our everyday challenges have been amplified by the pandemic and its consequences for the economy and society. Those living with financial hardship, health conditions, or caregiving responsibilities, in particular, may feel there is no end in sight. But even if stress seems essential to your circumstances and you don’t have the option or the resources to change them, there are ways you can support yourself.

Air pollution is cutting short the lives of billions of people by up to six years, according to a new report, making it a far greater killer than smoking, car crashes or HIV/Aids.
Coal burning is the principal culprit, the researchers said, and India is worst affected, with the average citizen dying six years early. China has slashed air pollution in the last seven years, but dirty air is still cutting 2.6 years from its people’s lifespan.

Ahmad – not his real name – left Afghanistan after the US invasion began in 2001. He sought asylum in the UK, and eventually settled in Glasgow, finally becoming a citizen last year.
But his wife and children live in Kabul. In August, with his wife heavily pregnant, he flew back to be with them, believing there would be time to bring them back to the UK if anything went wrong. But the baby was born even as the Taliban began to seize control of Afghanistan’s cities. When the capital fell, Ahmad, armed with an email from the British government calling him forward, came with his family to the airport, in hope of a flight out.

A television channel in Ivory Coast apologised after airing a show in which a male guest introduced as an ex-rapist showed how he assaulted his victims using a dummy for the demonstration.

The France international left Atlético for Barcelona in a €120m deal in 2019 but has failed to live up to expectations. He has scored 22 goals in 74 La Liga games for the Catalan club.

Black surgeons are far less likely to be promoted than their white colleagues, according to analysis of NHS medics’ careers in England.
Black men who were junior surgeons in 2010 were 27% less likely to be promoted to consultant than white men between 2016 and 2020, while black women were 42% less likely. The stark evidence of a glass ceiling has raised warnings that treatment may suffer unless senior ranks are made more representative and “old boys’ networks” dismantled. The Royal College of Surgeons described the study of more than 3,000 doctors as “deeply concerning”.

                    <span>Fears towers will block out natural light and increase noise around 320-year-old Bevis Marks synagogue 
Tucked away in a courtyard in the City of London, surrounded by glass, steel and concrete skyscrapers, is a historic and religious gem: the oldest synagogue in the UK.
On Friday evenings, at the start of the Jewish sabbath, it takes 45 minutes to light up to 240 candles in the original chandeliers hanging from the ceiling of the 320-year-old building.

In women’s football you’ll often find there are men’s clubs that talk the talk a lot more than they walk the walk. Leicester City, however, do the latter. The women’s side were taken fully under the wing of the club and turned fully professional in the process in August 2020.
Last season they romped to a first Championship title and promotion in their first year as a full-time outfit, winning 16 of their 20 games and scoring 54 goals in the process — 20 more than second-place Durham.

One of the UK’s most senior intelligence chiefs has held talks with Taliban leaders to negotiate safe passage out of Afghanistan for British nationals and Afghans who worked with UK forces, and to seek assurances that the country will not become a base for international terrorists.
Sir Simon Gass, the chair of the joint intelligence committee, travelled to Doha in Qatar a few days ago, where most of the Taliban’s exiled leadership is based, to talk to Afghanistan’s new rulers as UK, US and other western troops pulled out.

                    <span>This BBC show about Miri’s return home after 18 years in prison is a pure and painful delight, which can move you from tears to laughter within a single line
We pick up with thirtysomething ex-con Miri Matteson (played by Daisy Haggard, co-creator of this comedy-drama with Laura Solon) for the second series of Back to Life (BBC Three/iPlayer) just a few weeks on from when we left her. She is now six weeks into life as a free woman – bar her mandatory meetings with her probation officer, Janice (Jo Martin, still lethally brilliant in a part that has been beefed up this go-round, surely in recognition of everything she did the first time) – and things are ... OK. Miri is keeping her Tamagotchi alive, is taking driving lessons, is about to start a trial run as a supermarket employee and is still friends-with-benefits with neighbour Billy (Adeel Akhtar). The benefits are basically food-based (or, as Janice puts it, “You haven’t even seen his cocky yet”). After last series’ ice-cream cones, they move on in the first episode of the new to a sandwich lunch on the freezing Hythe shoreline. But the oh-so-gradual evolution of this, the daftest, tenderest relationship on television, is what makes it such a pure and painful delight. It manages to crush and swell the heart all at once.
On the other hand, Miri is still trying to come to terms with the revelations about her best friend Mandy’s (Christine Bottomley) involvement in the crime for which Miri served 18 years in prison, and her mother’s adulterous affair with Miri’s ex-boyfriend Dom (Jamie Michie); all while learning how to use the internet and smartphones, and restoring a bank account she hasn’t used for two decades.

David Evans, the party’s general secretary, told staff in July that the party’s management were seeking at least 90 redundancies as they try to repair Labour finances after several costly legal battles and three general elections in six years.

A second-minute goal from newly recruited Nikita Parris and a Kim Little penalty in the first half was added to by Vivianne Miedema’s 96th Arsenal goal to put the hosts in the driving seat before their Women’s Super League opener on Sunday.

                    <span>This remarkable documentary shows exactly how 9/11 unfolded for George W Bush, from the multiple prayer breaks to the anti-anthrax pills – and the vow to ‘kick ass’ before he knew whose ass to kick
There is a particular kind of political documentary that tries to put us “in the room”, to tell us how historic decisions were made and how the fallible humans who made them felt. But on 11 September 2001, when planes hijacked by al-Qaida terrorists destroyed the twin towers of New York’s World Trade Center and took the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans, the chaos was such that there was no single “room”. President George W Bush and his advisers, afraid for their own safety and constantly searching for information, were on the move all day and had to conduct their business in airbase bunkers, the back room of a school and aboard the president’s jet, Air Force One.
Nevertheless, 9/11: Inside the President’s War Room (BBC One) gives the sensation of being in the room in a way that few documentaries ever have. That day has often been described as a disaster movie no screenwriter would dare imagine. Here, it is a horrifyingly tragic but also propulsive story, with twin narratives following the president’s movements and the developing carnage on the ground, minute by minute.

Two years ago, a small pocket of land three kilometres from Auckland’s international airport became the most prominent site of a struggle by Māori, New Zealand’s indigenous people, to reclaim land confiscated by the crown more than 150 years ago.
Ihumātao contains evidence of New Zealand’s first commercial gardens, where thousands of hectares were planted with kumara, a tropical sweet potato which thrived in the warm and nutritious soil. The adjacent stonefields, today a category one Unesco heritage site, are rich with ancient nurseries and storage pits. When William Hobson, then-governor of New Zealand, founded Auckland in 1840, the produce of Ihumātao sustained the growing population.

Lady Scotland, the secretary general of the Commonwealth, and a long-time target of the Conservative government, faces a challenge for her post from the Kenyan defence minister with the support of the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta.
Kenya’s defence minister, Monica Juma, was nominated on Tuesday for the post in a surprise move, which came despite the fact no date is yet set for the next Commonwealth summit – the likely backdrop for any attempt to try to force out Scotland. Some supporters of Scotland suspect Kenya has been encouraged by Britain – with which it has close ties – to mount the challenge.

‘We hope it has drawn a lot more people in,’ says batter

Sophia Dunkley says she is hopeful that the record crowds for women’s cricket during the Hundred will transfer into increased interest in England’s series against New Zealand, which begins on Wednesday with a Twenty20 at Chelmsford.
Chelmsford is rumoured to be a sellout, but the Essex ground has long been a hotbed of support for the women’s game. The remainder of the series – two further T20s followed by five one-day internationals – will prove the real test, amid questions about the extent to which the Hundred has successfully served as a gateway into other formats for its new audience.

                    <span>England captain confident saga has not tarnished reputation
‘My focus is to win silverware at Tottenham,’ says striker

Harry Kane has insisted his conscience is clear after his unsuccessful attempts to force a move from Tottenham to Manchester City.
Kane, who is poised to captain England in their World Cup qualifier against Hungary on Thursday night, made clear that he had no regrets about trying to engineer a move. The striker’s hopes of a lucrative transfer fell through after the Premier League champions decided not to meet Spurs’ £150m asking price, but he is confident the saga has not tarnished his reputation.

                    <span>Vague demand for board refresh from Causeway likely a hangover from £2bn rights issue
The last time Rolls-Royce had an US activist fund on its tail, the aero-engine manufacturer took the unusual step of inviting one of its representatives onto the board. ValueAct Capital was judged to have constructive ideas and useful industry expertise. The four-year relationship, which ran until 2019, turned out harmoniously.
Causeway Capital Management, the latest US fund with a 9% stake, looks a different beast, at least to judge by its comments to the FT at the weekend. The striking feature was the wooly nature of its main grumble: a demand for a board “refresh” in the interests of “fresh thinking”. What does that mean?

Imposing vaccine passports is likely to make hesitant people even more reluctant to get Covid jabs, research involving more than 16,000 people has found as Downing Street vowed to press ahead with the plan within a month.
Boris Johnson announced in July that the government would make it compulsory for nightclubs and other crowded indoor venues to ensure customers have been fully vaccinated before allowing them entry.

Afghanistan latest news – live

British sources have said a “joint decision” was taken with the US to keep Kabul airport’s Abbey gate open before last week’s terror attack, in an attempt to dispel a leaked claim from the Pentagon that it was done on behalf of the UK.
The effort to smooth over transatlantic differences comes at a time of growing political concern over the US-UK relationship, and in response to an unusually detailed insider account of Pentagon decision-making.

Campaigners have called for a national voucher scheme to encourage parents to embrace reusable nappies after Downing Street denied reports of a new tax on disposable ones.
The government insisted there were no plans for a tax on single-use nappies despite suggestions they were the next item on a “ministerial hitlist” after last week’s crackdown on single-use plastic plates and cutlery in England.

The furlough scheme should be extended to protect workers in industries that continue to be damaged by the pandemic, business groups and unions have said as the job subsidy programme that has supported more than 11 million employees entered its final month.
Aviation industry workers and staff at Britain’s airports should be allowed to remain on furlough until next year when travel restrictions are likely to be lifted and the airline industry returns to normal, they said.

On the ninth day of XR’s latest protest campaign, the Guardian witnessed officers from the Metropolitan police climb the sides of the bus parked across the junction at the south of the bridge, striking and wrestling with protesters.

                    <span>After almost 20 years, America has ended its longest war. But its duties to Afghans endure
The histories are already being written, but for now, two moments encapsulate the closing moments of America’s longest war. One was the eerie, lonely night-vision image of the last US soldier boarding the military’s final flight from Afghanistan. The other came a day earlier, when a retaliatory strike targeting Islamic State reportedly claimed the lives of 10 civilians, including at least six children. Together, they convey the sense of hopelessness and waste, after almost 20 years and $2tn, the carelessness which too often characterised both the US presence and its withdrawal, and the costs to Afghans.
Though Donald Trump set the clock for departure ticking, Joe Biden’s timing owed more to symbolism than pragmatism. The president promised that the US military would leave before 11 September – the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terrorist attacks that led the US to topple the Taliban.

                    <span>The balance of power in less well-paid sectors is changing for the better. Labour can benefit
The first Covid lockdown inspired an outpouring of gratitude towards the key workers who kept the show on the road, while the rest of us remained indoors. But the weekly applause on doorsteps gradually faded away, as the nation found itself digging in for the long haul. The economic balance of power that had led to low levels of pay for people doing highly valued jobs remained fundamentally unchanged.
Well over a year later, the delivery drivers, food production workers and other employees vital to Britain’s supply chains are back in the headlines. As parliament prepares to return from recess next week, a combination of the pandemic and the effects of Brexit has made labour shortages in these sectors one of the central stories of the summer. And for the first time in decades, it seems the politics of work and the balance of power in the labour market may be changing. Last month, the Unite union won a higher pay rise for beer delivery drivers after threatening strike action. Online shopping deliveries from companies such as Asos and Argos may be delayed if DHL workers vote to reject a 1% pay rise and take industrial action. Meanwhile, an array of bonuses, incentives and inducements is being offered by businesses in an attempt to persuade people to work for them.

                    <span>Jeremy Morris oversaw sexual harassment complaints against don who was readmitted despite student contact ban
The master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge University, has resigned over an allegation that he mishandled sexual harassment complaints, after an independent inquiry recommended the college initiate disciplinary action. 
Jeremy Morris oversaw a sexual harassment case in 2019, in which Cambridge don Peter Hutchinson was readmitted to his college less than two years after he had been permanently excluded and banned from contacting students after an internal investigation. 
Hutchinson, who had been accused of nearly a dozen incidents of inappropriate behaviour between 2014 and 2015, regained some college privileges when he automatically became an emeritus professor after his retirement.
The college provoked widespread ire among staff and students in 2019 when it defended its decision to restore Hutchinson’s access to the college for certain college events and to exercise his dining rights on grounds that the original decision to remove him in 2017 had “not been agreed with Dr Hutchinson and was incorrect”.
Trinity Hall responded to the backlash by commissioning an independent inquiry led by Gemma White QC into the college’s handling of the allegations against Hutchinson.

The Taliban marked the start of their first day in full control of Afghanistan with celebratory gunfire, minutes after the last US plane of soldiers and their ambassador lifted off from Kabul airport, sealing Washington’s humiliating defeat in its longest war.
Twenty years, tens of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars separated the arrival of the first US troops on Afghan soil after 9/11 and the Taliban’s triumphant restoration in the Afghan capital.

In 1970, she was even on the Broadway stage in Georgy, starring as the awkward, dowdy title character, played by Lynn Redgrave in the film version, Georgy Girl, four years earlier. She received a Tony award nomination as best actress in a musical, despite the production proving a flop and closing after only four performances at the Winter Garden theatre.

The case attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty.

Alone among Soviet dissidents of the Leonid Brezhnev years, Sergei Kovalev, who has died aged 91, went on to play a major role in the eras of Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, only to find that his outspoken support for human rights put him once again in opposition to the Russian government.
Kovalev had already sacrificed a scientific career in the late 1960s to speak out against the Soviet state’s abuse of human rights and was one of the leading campaigners to be imprisoned under Brezhnev. Appointed against strong opposition as chairman of the Russian parliament’s human rights commission in 1990, and human rights ombudsman in 1994, he was forced to resign following a series of brave and damning reports from Chechnya in 1995. A quiet, almost self-effacing man, he became the hero of the internal opposition to the genocidal war.

                    <span>High court ruling led to animal being destroyed after twice testing positive for bovine TB at Gloucestershire farm
After four years of court battles, protests and celebrity interventions, Geronimo, the UK’s most divisive alpaca, has been put down by government officials.
The eight-year-old animal, who had tested positive twice for bovine tuberculosis and whose fate triggered heated debate across the country, was taken from his home at Shepherds Close Farm in south Gloucestershire on Tuesday.

                    <span>Philip Aylett and Steven Julians on the Conservatives’ plans for hospital-building, Kevin Donovan on the health and care bill, and Gal Travis on a day to thank NHS staff
Thank you, Rachel Clarke, for highlighting the disturbing emerging reality of the so-called New Hospital Programme (For a doctor, the Tories’ empty promises on hospitals are soul-destroying, 23 August). Just look at West Hertfordshire NHS trust, one of eight in the first wave of NHP projects. When Boris Johnson visited Watford hospital in October 2019, he claimed the area would soon have “world-class facilities”. But it is not turning out like that.
The trust’s preferred option is for a new hospital facility to be housed in three tower blocks in a heavily congested and inaccessible spot, next to the current Watford hospital. Other local hospitals would get minimal investment. The trust’s choice has zero chance of being approved by the government. It will cost more than £900m, well over any budget – a unicorn hospital.

                    <span>Ignore the myths about nuclear power, writes Rob Loveday of Generation Atomic – it is an essential source of clean energy
The letter on nuclear energy (25 August) sadly could not be more wrong – nuclear is one of the cleanest fuels we have, and has always been so. The carbon and material footprints of nuclear – for its entire lifetime, including mining and decommissioning – are lower than solar and on a par with wind, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Moreover, the nuclear industry manages its waste stream – that is more than can be said for the solar industry, which is set to produce millions of tons of toxic waste. Besides, spent nuclear fuel is not “waste” but a valuable source of low-carbon energy that can be recycled via reprocessing or proposed breeder reactors, thereby neutralising the vast majority of the radioactivity.

What won’t Boris Johnson do next? A new political season is about to get under way, and the prime minister’s agenda is packed with choices to defer and challenges to duck.
There is always a back-to-school atmosphere at Westminster in the autumn, but it will be intensified this year by the resumption of parliamentary business unmuffled by Covid restrictions. The recall of MPs for a debate on Afghanistan in the middle of August was a reminder that politics has missed the volatile energy generated by a heaving Commons.

Arifa Ahmadi* started her first day under full Taliban control by burning her jeans and any other clothes that the Taliban would be likely to disapprove of as the nation woke up to a new era after the last American troops left the country overnight.
Ahmadi is a part of the generation that has grown up during the past 20 years and enjoyed freedom, education and employment under a government backed by the west – but lost her job after the Taliban took over the country.

Issued by the National Records of Scotland (NRS) on Tuesday, the guidelines tell people to answer the sex question according to how they self-identify, regardless of the details on their birth certificate or whether they have a gender recognition certificate.

Officials in the war-partitioned country’s breakaway north erected what local media described as a 400 metre barrier off the Karpas peninsula to prevent the slick reaching its pristine shores.

Spencer, the much anticipated film about Diana, Princess of Wales, starring Kristen Stewart, is due to receive its world premiere on Friday at the Venice film festival – one of a string of high-profile debuts that the film industry is hoping will herald a return to some sort of normality after 18 months of pandemic.
Along with the near-simultaneous Toronto film festival, Venice has traditionally marked the end of the summer blockbuster film season and the arrival of films aiming for critical praise and subsequent awards recognition. Spencer is due to be joined at Venice by Dune, the long-gestating adaptation of Frank Herbert’s mammoth sci-fi novel directed by Denis Villeneuve; Ridley Scott’s medieval drama The Last Duel, starring Matt Damon, Adam Driver and Jodie Comer; horror-thriller Last Night in Soho, directed by Edgar Wright; and Parallel Mothers, the latest from Spanish auteur Pedro Almodóvar.

Nelufar Hedayat is an Afghan-British journalist

I call my father every other day now. This is new. There used to be times where weeks would go by and we wouldn’t hear from each other. Now it’s different. Often, I call him to help stymie the gulps and tears, the flood of feelings of hopelessness, to talk about the trauma and the flashbacks I’m having from when I was made a refugee of the war in Afghanistan in the 1990s.
I’m a different person from three weeks ago – before the Taliban walked in and took over Kabul, declaring themselves the new leaders of Afghanistan. My headphones blare out warbling ballads by Farhad Darya, a name many might not recognise but, to millions of Afghans and our diaspora, an icon and arguably the most lauded male pop star to come out of my beautiful broken birth-land. “Oooh those days / Safe as houses, boy we were safe / our hearts close together / Lying in the acacia’s shade, Kabul was safe.”

                    <span>Yet another Before Sunrise imitator – this time with two men who have 15 hours to spend together in Berlin – falters because of a subpar script and annoying characters
Richard Linklater has a lot to answer for. Ever since Before Sunrise, countless indie films have tried to ape the incandescent spirit of that 1995 classic, usually to middling results. Daniel Sanchez Lopez’s Boy Meets Boy is the latest unfortunately failed attempt, and once again reveals the achilles heel of these copycat projects. Before Sunrise might appear improvised but it has a tightly constructed script. Without good writing, watching random people walking around rarely makes for a good time at the movies.
At least the chosen location is charming enough. Having locked eyes the previous night at a club, Johannes (Alexandros Koutsoulis) and Harry (Matthew James Morrison), wander about on a sun-drenched day in Berlin, before the latter’s flight back to the UK. It’s the kind of brief encounter where the goodbyes pre-exist the hellos: the young men know they only have 15 hours together. Most of their conversations are spontaneous – or try to be; they range from family life and jobs to, later, more personal subjects such as monogamy and open relationships. The issues discussed are interesting yet the subpar writing renders the pair’s opinions inconsequential, if not outright annoying. “Quirky” moments, such as Harry showing a film clip by Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl, only induce eyerolls.

But when Joshua Rofé got to work as director, he plunged into a maze of ugly legal disputes, interviewees too scared to go on the record and bitter wrangling over Ross’s legacy.

In a new written statement, John Lydon has responded with worry and dismay after losing a court case over the use of music by the Sex Pistols in an upcoming TV series, directed by Danny Boyle.
Lydon, known as Johnny Rotten during his time fronting the punk band, had been sued by drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones after Lydon prevented the use of Pistols songs in the series Pistol. Lydon lost the case, with a judge ruling that Jones and Cook were allowed to overrule him using a majority rule created in the terms of a band agreement.

Iranian prosecutors have opened criminal cases against six guards at Tehran’s Evin prison after footage showing widespread abuse of detainees at the facility leaked out last week.
The judiciary said “some” prison guards were in detention after a three-day investigation into mistreatment and grim conditions at Evin. Zabihollah Khodaeian, a judiciary spokesperson, said authorities had also summoned two guards and punished others. He did not elaborate on the penalties or identifying the suspects.

Nizar Banat knew he was going to die. As he grew bolder calling out corrupt members of Fatah, the party which controls the Palestinian Authority, the death threats mounted. In May, his home near Hebron was attacked by masked gunmen on motorbikes, in an incident which left his children traumatised.
After that, the political activist decided it wasn’t safe to stay home. “He went to his cousin’s house in H2 [an area of Hebron city controlled by the Israeli military] because he hoped Fatah and the PA could not reach him there, but he knew they were coming for him,” said Jihan, Banat’s widow, as she hugged their youngest son in the family’s reception room in the village of Dura. The front of the house is still pockmarked with bullet holes. “He told me: ‘I don’t want to be killed in front of the children.’”

                    <span>This dramatisation of a real-life plot by a group of Jewish survivors to poison the water supply in Nuremberg is well acted but too neatly packaged
Based on actual events, this film from Israeli brothers Doron and Yoav Paz dramatises an astonishing piece of Holocaust history: a deadly plot by a small group of Jewish survivors to poison the water supply in Nuremberg. “An eye for an eye. Six million for six million.” It’s a handsome-looking, decently acted film, but unpersuasive and fundamentally lightweight, the material packaged a little too neatly into a conventional easy-to-consume movie in which characters purposefully stride in slo-mo across rooms. Characters speaking in accented English don’t help.
It’s 1945 and former death camp inmate Max (August Diehl), face gaunt, eyes red-rimmed, walks half-starved back to his village in Germany to search for his missing wife and son. The man now living in his house is a former neighbour. He pulls a gun on Max. “Just because the war is over it doesn’t mean we can’t kill Jews anymore,” he barks, a bit flatly. Like a lot of the scenes here, it doesn’t generate a sense of enough at stake.

What can I make for dinner when I don’t want to use the oven or stove? 
Paul, Brighton
You are not alone, Paul. This conundrum is all too familiar to chef and Sardinia resident Letitia Clark. “It’s often so hot over here, there’s little will to do any real cooking,” says the author of La Vita e Dolce. “I also have the world’s worst oven, so I’m always keen not to use it.” As is so often the case, solace can be found in cheese – more specifically, in “a big blob of ricotta in the middle of a salad doused in punchy olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt”.

                    <span>In an extract from his book on late musicians’ estates, Eamonn Forde explores the feud that began shortly after Jeff Buckley’s death between the songwriter’s label and his mother
Jeff Buckley had released two live EPs (Live at Sin-é in 1993 and Live from the Bataclan in 1995) plus one complete studio album (Grace in 1994) before he died in 1997. Since his death, eight live albums and multiple compilation albums have been released, spanning music recorded while he was signed to Sony and also before he had a record deal.
The most contentious is Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, which was released a year after his death. Buckley had already scrapped a batch of recordings produced by Tom Verlaine in late 1996 and early 1997 and was preparing to record afresh in Memphis, the place where he drowned in the Mississippi.

Now authors including Val McDermid, Naomi Alderman and Dreda Say Mitchell are set to continue the adventures of the elderly amateur sleuth, with the first ever “new” Agatha Christie short story collection out next year.
The 12 writers, who also include Kate Mosse, Elly Griffiths and Ruth Ware, are all “Christie devotees”, said publisher HarperCollins, and will reimagine Miss Marple “through their own unique perspective while staying true to the hallmarks of a traditional mystery”.

                    <span>In the vacuum left by the US, regional politics between Iran, UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia is bound to become more messy
As the US military finally leaves Afghanistan after 20 years, all eyes are rightly on the human tragedy and the political implications of the Taliban’s return to power. But to understand what may come next for both Afghanistan and the world, more attention needs to be paid to the tectonic shifts in the Arab and Iranian involvement in Afghanistan since the US-led invasion in 2001. Unless the regional contests for influence are accompanied by substantive and inclusive dialogue between these actors, turmoil will only increase for the country.
Iran’s changing role is a case in point. Tehran was once eager to get rid of the Taliban. In 1998, the killing of diplomats at the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif almost ignited a war. The murders took place in the chaos of the Taliban’s capture of the northern Afghan city. Tehran thus put the blame on the Taliban, which in turn pinned it on rogue elements. So it was unconventional – but certainly not odd – when Iran and the US emerged as implicit partners against the Taliban in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Tehran and Washington jointly backed the Northern Alliance – an alliance of warlords that held 10% of Afghanistan – as an anti-Taliban force.

The Quadroin is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV): a 3D-printed self-propelled machine designed to mimic a penguin in order to measure the properties of oceanic eddies.

Downing Street’s second attempt to appoint Paul Dacre as chair of the media regulator Ofcom has hit another snag, with ministers struggling to find people willing to interview the former Daily Mail editor for the job.
No 10 has been trying to appoint Dacre, 72, as chair of the media regulator for more than a year as part of wider plans to install government-friendly figures at the top of cultural institutions.

                    <span>Extra-high heels are having a moment, from Beyoncé to Olivia Rodrigo. Could they mark a return to an era of prosperity?
You will have heard of the hemline index. It was first theorised in 1926 by the economist George Taylor, and stated that skirts get shorter during times of financial prosperity and longer in a recession. But could a parallel theory work for women’s shoes? As we approach an era of Covid measures relaxing and spending gradually increasing, can the height of your heels be a good economic predictor of a boom or bust era?
The exaggerated heel has been trending (a possible harbinger for the so-called roaring 20s) while the hashtag #pleaserheels (named after the high-arched shoe) has had more than 118m views on TikTok. At the weekend, Beyoncé paired a black Versace dress with barbie pink jacket and matching pair of super heeled shoes. Earlier in the month, Lady Gaga wore some baby blue body-con athleisure with some extreme platform heels.

Flatten 3 cloves of garlic with a heavy knife, then peel away the skins. Warm 4 tbsp of olive oil in a wide, shallow-sided pan and add the garlic, letting it cook very briefly, just until it is fragrant. Drain a 400g can of cannellini beans, but don’t be tempted to rinse them.

                    <span>Today’s challenges demand radical action. The old orthodoxy of free markets and hands-off government won’t cut it
As western economies emerge from the pandemic, their governments face a choice: do they seek to address the profound problems that Covid exposed, or try to return to “business as usual” as quickly as possible? Their problem is that many of the issues exacerbated by the pandemic, such as wage stagnation, precarious work and rising inequality are not bugs in an otherwise well-functioning system, but inevitable outcomes of the way that western economies are now organised. So a business-as-usual approach simply won’t work. Much more fundamental change is needed.
The US government seems to recognise this. Joe Biden’s economic plans are a radical departure from the era that stretches from Reagan to Obama, when governments sought to keep taxes and public spending low and focused principally on globalised trade and the education and training of the workforce. Unlike his predecessors, Biden is pursuing large-scale public spending and taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to borrow for infrastructure investment. His stimulus plans target the climate crisis while creating green jobs and expanding health, education and childcare – the “social infrastructure” that is essential to the economy but has often been ignored by mainstream economists.

                    <span>It’s easy to put off tender discussions, but successfully addressing the most emotional subjects always starts with listening
There’s a conversation you’re avoiding. It feels important, the stakes are high, there are strong feelings involved and you are putting it off: “The time isn’t right”; “I can’t find the words”; “I don’t want to get emotional”.
But delaying doesn’t solve anything and anticipation is often far more uncomfortable than the conversation itself. Getting started might involve some awkward moments, but, after that, the situation is open for discussion and exploration.

                    <span>Once a year, we pupils were given total freedom, whether we chose to go to the zoo or get on the dodgems. I decided to surprise my mother with a visit
The best day of my school year was always the same: 29 May. It was known as Founder’s Day which, in most schools with such pretensions, meant being forced to dress in your best clothes, sing a hymn in Latin and then listen to some old bloke telling you how to live a good and righteous life. Doesn’t sound promising, does it? Except that at our school, it was different. We may have had the Latin hymn but, after that, we were told we must leave the school and go wherever we wanted (within legal limits, I suppose, though I don’t ever remember that being spelled out). This may not sound that spectacular, until you realise that this was a school for blind and almost-blind children. 
You were also presented with five shillings, which I suppose was intended as a survival kit, but which we realised could buy 60 penny chews, or a dirty book from the top shelf of the newsagents, which the one boy with a bit of sight could read to you with the aid of a powerful magnifying glass.

The research, reported by the BBC, also suggests that repetitive contact events, rather than only concussions, incurred through rugby caused the declines seen in the players.

It’s 8am on a damp Brighton morning and I’m joining Rob Jones-Mantle on his recycling round, but the second-hand batteries on Magpie Co-op’s fleet of repurposed electric vehicles are still charging. If only they could plug into Rob himself, we’d be on the road instantly: at 56, he’s a one-man renewable energy source in high vis and what he tells me are a pair of restored Edwardian steam engine firefighter’s glasses.
Rob and Magpie started out in 1990 when recycling was not really high on the political radar, although there was growing awareness of the amount of waste going into landfill: “The climate situation has been with us since the 1970s. We lived locally, we saw what was happening locally.” Working initially in partnership with the council and on a shoestring, a small group of concerned volunteers started a modest kerbside collection, which surprised them with its swift popularity. “We did cash for cans, we got the council’s clean up round, we got 5000 customers.”

                    <span>Probably the most important relaxation of the Covid rules is the chance to properly celebrate a loved one’s life and all its contradictions

My dad’s funeral generated a gushing stream of anecdotes. I don’t remember any feelings at all, just event after event, most of which involved my brother or my dog. The one about my dad’s best friend is probably the best, but it is too salacious and actionable to tell here. The second-best featured my brother and the dog – he left the wake with my sister’s friend on the pretext of taking Spot for a walk. Whatever they did on this “walk” held insufficient interest for the dog, who brought himself neatly back home, carrying his own lead, like a cartoon. Realising they’d lost him, and mindful of what a terrible day that would be to lose a person’s dog, the frantic couple spent two hours wandering round Ramsgate, calling his name.
The day wasn’t funny because it was un-sad; my father was 64, and we felt absolutely bilked by the universe – robbed blind of two decades of matchless bonhomie. It’s just that the closer you are to a person, the more absurd you find those rituals that directly follow their deaths. When my uncle died a couple of years later, I read at his funeral, in place of my mother, who didn’t want to. In a hurry, I just Googled, “What to read at funerals.” When I stood up to solemnly intone the Song from Cymbeline – “Fear no more the frown o’ the great / Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke” – it was the first time I’d ever set eyes on the words. I almost had to stop halfway through, since my uncle was, memorably, a bit of a tyrant, never not frowning, so it sounded as if I was addressing the congregation with a poetic: “Everybody relax, he’s died.” The family all found that hilarious, his colleagues, maybe not so much.

The Azores archipelago (Açores in Portuguese) lies about 1,000 miles west of mainland Europe and is made up of nine volcanic islands: São Miguel (the largest), São Jorge, Terceira, Pico, Faial, Ilha das Flores, Santa Maria, Graciosa and Corvo, which you can cross by ferry or plane.
Colonised by the Portuguese in 1432, the Azores is now an autonomous region. During the period known as the Discoveries, Portugal had the largest high-seas fleet in the world, with many of its ships stopping to replenish stocks in the Azores as they travelled back and forth to Brazil, India, Japan and elsewhere, bringing with them spices that changed Azorean cuisine from simple. plain dishes to ones spiced and flavoured with new-world produce, such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes and yams.

                    <span>Cyclist wins 16th gold of career to draw level with Mike Kenny
Aims for record-breaking 17th medal in Thursday’s road race

Sarah Storey eclipsed all competition to win her second gold medal of Tokyo 2020 in the C5 time trial on Tuesday morning. In doing so she also drew level with the swimmer Mike Kenny as the most successful British Paralympian of all time.
The Dame finished a minute and a half clear of teammate Crystal Lane-Wright and, at points, was catching the tail of the men’s race at the Fuji International Speedway circuit, so dominant was her performance. That is standard for Storey, who spoke afterwards of the “single-mindedness” that has brought her 16 gold medals to this point and the prospect of another, a record-breaking 17th, in two days’ time.

This episode includes discussion of the sexual abuse of children.
It was a Sunday evening in the summer of 2016 when the knock came on Emma’s front door. Her ex-husband had just dropped their children off, and she thought he had left something behind. Instead, she saw him surrounded by police officers.

Former world No 1 eventually falls 2-6, 7-6(7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4

When the US Open revealed that Andy Murray had been drawn in the first round against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the in-form third seed, the reaction from many onlookers was of anguish and pity. Another week, another slice of brutal luck, it was said. In his pre-tournament press conference, Murray was asked about his inability to “catch a break”.
But this is Andy Murray, still a former world No 1, still the most competitive and dogged person in most rooms he has ever entered, and so he simply took it as a challenge to produce his very best tennis. Astoundingly, that is precisely what he did as he so nearly pulled off a monumental win, leading Tsitsipas by two sets to one before gracefully falling 2-6, 7-6(7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 after four hours and 48 minutes.

Writing in the Telegraph, the actor and comedian, who is also president of Mind, voiced the charity’s appeal to ministers for hubs through which children can access support without a referral from a doctor or their school.

UK business confidence has hit a four-year high, thanks to growing optimism about the post-Covid recovery, but companies highlighted concerns about staff shortages, which could push up pay in the coming months.
The vaccine rollout, removal of lockdown restrictions and changes to self-isolation rules all contributed to greater optimism among firms in August, according to the latest snapshot from Lloyds Bank.

The Indonesian Hambali – real name Encep Nurjaman – was a leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, a south-east Asian militant group with ties to al-Qaida. The US government says he recruited militants, including the two Malaysians, Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep Nurjaman, for jihadist operations.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The number of solid organ transplants fell dramatically around the world between 2019 and 2020, researchers have found, highlighting the widespread impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on health services and patients.
As the pandemic surged, hospitals were forced to delay potentially life-saving organ transplant surgery, because of resources such as intensive care beds being needed for Covid patients and because of concerns including whether it was safe to treat transplant recipients in hospital.

Two Oregon counties hit hard by Covid-19 are running out of space to hold bodies amid an intense surge in cases that is overwhelming the state’s healthcare system, forcing authorities to request refrigerated trucks to help handle the overflow.
In Josephine county, located in the state’s south-west, the local hospital is exceeding its body storage capacity and the area’s five funeral homes and three crematoriums are “at the edge of crisis capacity daily”, the county emergency manager told the state last week. Meanwhile, Tillamook county, on Oregon’s north-west coast, reported that its sole funeral home “is now consistently at or exceeding their capacity” of nine bodies.

Johanna Konta has been forced to withdraw from the US Open with a left thigh injury hours before she was due to take the court in her first‑round match. Konta had been scheduled to face Kristina Mladenovic of France on Monday afternoon but she was replaced by Russia’s Kamilla Rakhimova.
The withdrawal marks another setback for the British No 1 in what has turned out an extremely difficult summer as she also withdrew from Wimbledon and the Olympics after testing positive for Covid-19.

                    <span>In this riveting drama, Coogan stars as DCI Clive Driscoll, who finally investigates the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence fully, underlining the extra years of agony his parents had to endure
A few lines across the screen sum up the dreadful story so far. “On 22 April 1993 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack. The police failed to catch his killers. A public inquiry found the Metropolitan police to be incompetent and institutionally racist. In 2006, 13 years after their son’s murder, his parents are still fighting for justice.”
We begin in 2006, in ITV’s new three-part drama Stephen – scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce with every ounce of his customary compassion and intelligence. Stephen’s mother Doreen (Sharlene Whyte) gives a speech at the centre under construction, whose users she hopes will become her boy’s living legacy, and his father Neville (Hugh Quarshie, who also played him in the award-winning 1999 ITV docu-drama The Murder of Stephen Lawrence) attends yet another meeting with yet another group of reluctant officials, trying to secure a judicial review. They grant him a review of the case instead.

Leeds are set to sign Daniel James from Manchester United for £24m, more than two years after they almost signed him on loan.
Despite starting the victory against Wolves on Sunday, the Wales forward has been used sparingly at Old Trafford under Ole Gunnar Solskjær and the impending arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus means the 23-year-old will be even further down the pecking order after United also signed Jadon Sancho for £73m from Borussia Dortmund.

Rival fans linking arms and bonding over the German 50+1 model. How strong we were. How right we were. How we showed them.

Rampant Warriors end run of five halves without a point

Wigan Warriors reignited their push for a Super League play-off place with victory against the fifth-placed Castleford Tigers on a day which could have huge ramifications on the race for the top six.
Following a disastrous run of recent form during which Adrian Lam’s side failed to score a point in the last five halves of rugby they had played, the Warriors knew another defeat here could have left them slipping to sixth, and increase the risk of them missing out on the play-offs. Instead, they ended the day in fourth with three rounds to go and are now a strong bet to avoid a late scramble to make the top six.

Afghanistan: live updates

MPs are scrambling to rescue more than 7,000 constituents and family members trapped in Afghanistan, according to figures provided to the Guardian, dwarfing the only estimates provided by the government of the number left behind.
Scores of Labour MPs have been inundated with pleas for help from thousands of constituents whose relatives have been left stranded since the UK’s final emergency airlift left Kabul following the country’s rapid fall to the Taliban. Among them are children, disabled relatives and people who face persecution due to their work, all with potential eligibility to be resettled in Britain.

Given that Real Madrid were formally established in 2020 and are competing in Europe for the first time, the absence of Bronze and White, following knee surgery and an unspecified medical procedure respectively, should not make too much difference to the outcome at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium.

Aemo’s annual grid reliability snapshot, to be released on Tuesday, notes the penetration of renewable generation in Australia reached a record high of 57% twice in 2021 – in April and again in August.

                    <span>Strategic failure has drastically reduced the west’s ability to influence the future course of events
As the final evacuation flights leave Kabul, watched in despair by those abandoned and in peril, the lasting consequences of strategic failure must now be faced. During the Doha peace talks, American diplomats liked to talk of a process towards an inclusive political settlement that would be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. The “process” turned out instead to be a victory procession for the Taliban. What comes now will therefore be Taliban-led and Taliban-owned. Hamstrung as a result of their own mistakes, the United States, Britain and their allies have little choice but to engage with the new reality.
Belated attempts are being made to do so from a supposed position of strength. As the last British forces left Kabul at the weekend, Boris Johnson adopted a stentorian tone to warn: “If the new regime … wants diplomatic recognition or to unlock the billions currently frozen, they will have to ensure safe passage for those who wish to leave the country, to respect the rights of women and girls, [and] to prevent Afghanistan becoming again an incubator for global terror.” It seems clear that Taliban leaders hope to avoid the international pariah status of the 1990s and will soon be in desperate need of cash. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have suspended payments to Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, and the Afghan central bank’s reserves are frozen in the US. But the notion that, as China and Russia pursue their own agendas, the west can continue to call the shots and impose its terms is wishful thinking.

The American physicist Richard Feynman thought that “nobody understands quantum mechanics”. That is no longer true. Smartphones, nuclear plants, medical scans and laser-operated doors have been built with insights from the physics that governs the subatomic level. What perplexes many is that the quantum world is governed by rules that run counter to classical notions of physical laws.
In quantum mechanics, nature is not deterministic. Subatomic particles do not travel a path that can be plotted. It is possible only to calculate the probability of finding these specks at a particular point. Where such calculations leave physics, that hardest of the hard sciences, has troubled its greatest minds. Albert Einstein thought the idea that an element of chance lay deep in science was absurd. “God does not play dice,” he famously declared.

Larry Elliott (So what’s so wrong with labour shortages driving up low wages?’, 29 August) doesn’t acknowledge that there are upwards wage pressures everywhere from Germany to Singapore and from Norway to America – in other words, in places that didn’t have Brexit. Moreover, moribund wage growth afflicted all of the advanced economies following the global financial crisis, not just the UK.
Second, it is true that migration correlated with a negative effect on low-paid occupations. However, that effect is tightly contextualised in terms of numbers of new occupational entrants and is consistently reported as being small. Compared to the effects of the financial crisis, the immigrant effect is very small indeed – as all the research shows. Perhaps tackling the underlying causes of low pay in tight labour markets rather than celebrating the removal of workers for being here in the wrong numbers might be more productive.

                    <span>Ian Harvey urges the JCVI to vaccinate teenagers as schools return from the summer break, and Austen Lynch says the Covid death toll is still high
Scientific advice to the government has mostly been good during the pandemic, but the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is showing unhelpful signs of procrastination over the vaccination of teenagers and the use of adult boosters (Report, 27 August). It is also playing out its discussion via the media rather than in a timely fashion in private. Its doubts about vaccinating teenagers are said to centre on concerns about side-effects, the ethics of indirect benefit and of using vaccines here rather than overseas. The mRNA vaccines that would be used in this group have an excellent safety profile, and are the least suitable for use in developing countries because of storage temperature requirements. Boys are already vaccinated against rubella for the benefit of others (ie pregnant women). The debate is reminiscent of the early hesitation about mask wearing, where some scientists swerved away from their use on the plausible but unlikely grounds of other unintended effects on behaviour. These were not realised, and most of us now regret the delay in mask wearing. I would urge the JCVI to realise that time is not on its side if an autumn campaign is to be organised.
Ian Harvey 
Emeritus professor of public health, University of East Anglia
• Re Devi Sridhar’s article (For most of the world, the pandemic is not over, 29 August), while recognising that the Delta variant of Covid is causing major problems throughout the world, the perception that it “feels for most people [here], the pandemic is over”, as it has fallen from the front pages, is to ignore the reality of the current situation.

As the gates of hell closed on Kabul, they were among the last to make it out. They landed in the early hours of Sunday morning, to a hero’s welcome from some, and shamed silence from others. For this was a planeload not of human souls – those desperate Afghans who had huddled knee-deep in sewage for days outside the airport in hopes of being saved – but of cats and dogs.
The Ministry of Defence confirmed, through audibly gritted teeth, that the private plane chartered to bring back former soldier turned animal rescuer Paul “Pen” Farthing and his menagerie of strays had been “assisted” through the airport by British troops in the final shambolic hours of the retreat from Kabul – even as human beings who had put their trust in the western forces they worked alongside were being abandoned to their fate.

                    <span>Our global reputation is in tatters. The UK needs soft power more than ever, yet everywhere the Tories are trashing it
After humiliation, here ends hubris and surely the “global Britain” delusion. No more fatuous boasting, no more “world-beating” and “world-leading”, but time for an honest audit of who we are, what we can do, and what we plainly can’t.
Holed below the waterline, Britain has done itself incalculable reputational damage in recent years. Rescuing Afghan dogs and cats may stand as a global emblem of barking mad Britain. John Casson, a recent ambassador to Egypt, sorrowfully tweets his lifetime Foreign Office goals: leading in the EU; freeing young Arabs from authoritarians; being impactful not transactional in development; and leaving Afghanistan in good shape. All these have failed.

The remarkable Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, who died in 2015 at the age of 106 and made movies right until the very end, often seems to me a film-maker from a statelier, almost pre-cinematic era: an epistolary director or manuscript-culture director. Here is what could be called his testamentary film, a personal cine-memoir or cine-meditation. It was shot in 1982, but withheld from release at the director’s request until after his death, which would be much further off than anyone imagined. It has only now found a release in the UK.

                    <span>The off-spinner has been a tactical omission in the series thus far but would bolster the tourists’ bowling and their batting
Anyone who spent the winter lockdown tracking England’s progressive stagger around India will remember the off‑spinner Ravichandran Ashwin wiping out batting lineups with the ease of a lazy swipe of the monopoly board.
A world-class bowler, the fastest to 300 Test wickets, he has, for tactical reasons, been carrying the drinks around England so far this summer. Following India’s thrashing by an innings at Headingley, though, the clamour has been growing for him to play in the fourth Test starting on Thursday in south London. It wouldn’t be his first foray to the Oval this year. He cut quite a dash in his short spell at Surrey in July, when he was signed to replace the injured New Zealand fast bowler Kyle Jamieson when Surrey still had a shot of making Division One and winning the title.

The Welsh education ministry said on Monday that all schools, universities and colleges in Wales would be supplied with ozone disinfecting machines for cleaning up Covid-hit classrooms.

                    <span>The fact he staggered to a club at 1am, red of face and out of place, made me feel an unexpected glimmer of warmth for him
If you had asked me yesterday to imagine a scenario in which I experienced any kind of warmth towards Michael Gove, well … I won’t say I couldn’t have done it, I’ll just say it would have taken some time. But it turns out all he had to do was go to a nightclub in Aberdeen and dance on his own, and not only did I momentarily forget his drawling self-importance, but the people of Scotland did too. You would think the other revellers would have chased him off the dancefloor, pausing only to spray paint him first, like a fur-coat wearer at an animal rights protest. If Aberdeen is famous for anything but granite, it’s the oil industry – and whatever you think of fossil fuels, that means the city is rammed with experts. So Saturday night could have been the perfect opportunity to express that, maybe, they had had enough of Gove.
Instead, they posed for selfies with him, swapped tall tales (did he, or did he not, try to evade the £5 entry fee by saying he was the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster?) and made the man feel like a visiting and esteemed dignitary to the land of trance and bacchanalia. There’s a Narnia thing, a code of values older than politics; it’s worse than unkind to mock someone who is dancing – it’s also cynical, joyless and where does it end? You would be like that woman who put a cat in a wheelie bin. What else might she dispose of so casually? Your dreams?

                    <span>The fault lies with western democracy at its most arrogant and interventionist
Who can we blame? There must be someone. When disaster lies all around, democracy craves a culprit, someone to carry the can. This past weekend has seen an orgy of blaming: of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, Dominic Raab (Britain’s foreign secretary), his ambassadors, Nato and the west generally, not to mention George Bush and Tony Blair. Afghanistan was supposed to be the “good” intervention, the one that worked. Yet the “nation” we spent 20 years building has suddenly collapsed. Where are the architects?
Victory has many parents, defeat is an orphan. Nothing looked as lonely this past weekend as “Afghan nation-building”. But whereas tyrants who fail can be toppled, democracy rightly diffuses responsibility. It is all very well accusing Biden or Johnson or their predecessors. We elected them. When things went well, the west trumpeted its values and patted itself on the back. It was so evidently superior.

But hospitality staff in many tourist hotspots beg to differ, saying they have suffered a barrage of complaints from “impatient” visitors and “Tripadvisor warriors”.
Restaurant and hotel owners said visitors were regularly complaining about slow service amid high demand, and that some had seemingly struggled to adapt to the change from their usual all-inclusive getaway abroad.

UN experts have called the use of the fuel, which began in 1922, a “catastrophe for the environment and public health”. By the 1970s, nearly all petrol produced around the world contained lead. Now the last country to use it, Algeria, has finally stopped selling it in petrol stations.

Felix Streng takes gold and Sherman Isidro Guity Guity silver

The clock ticked past three minutes and still there had been no decision. The men’s T64 100m had certainly been close, with the four leading competitors finishing within four hundredths of a second of one another. But who had claimed bronze between the German Johannes Floors and Britain’s Jonnie Peacock?
The rules determine that only in the event of a gap of less than 1,000th of a second would two athletes share a place. When the photo finish was eventually called, that was exactly what happened.

To some non-City observers the decisions look wrongheaded and, amid a wave of other takeovers including the sale of the defence contractors Ultra Electronics and Meggitt, suggest that while boards and shareholders talk about their good environmental, social and governance principles, money still talks.

                    <span>Plan for new communities led by lay people in unconventional venues has prompted Save the Parish campaign
One Sunday afternoon in September, a small group will gather at the Whisby nature reserve near Lincoln to explore its trails and marvel at the wildlife. Before they set off on a two-hour hike, they may fortify themselves with a hot drink and a slice of cake from the cafe; they might apply sunscreen or don waterproofs. One thing they are certain to do is join together in prayer.
This is Lincoln Forest Church, part of a growing network of Christian communities that meet outdoors to worship and engage with the natural world. “We are a church without walls,” said Melanie Carroll, who started the group five years ago.

Afghanistan – live updates

China’s top diplomat has urged the international community to engage with Afghanistan’s new Taliban government and “guide it actively”, in a phone call with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.
Wang Yi, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, also said that Washington should work with the international community to help the new regime run governmental functions normally, according to a statement. He added that the US’s “hasty withdrawal” could allow terrorist groups to “regroup and come back stronger”.

                    <span>There is some sustained brilliance here, but unfortunately it comes from the guest stars – and at 108 minutes, this long-awaited album is in need of an edit
Chaotic preview events for Kanye West’s 10th studio album Donda have dominated social media feeds in recent weeks, each one promising a release date that never materialised. The coverage of the events has focused on Kim Kardashian dressed as a Balenciaga-clad sleep paralysis demon, $50 chicken tenders, potential Drake disses, levitation and cameos from alleged rapist Marilyn Manson and the homophobic DaBaby. Fans called West a genius capable of creating exciting theatre that evolves in real time; others saw him as an empty provocateur. Much like kindred spirit Donald Trump, West seems to instinctively know how to weaponise controversy to drive interest in a new project.
With the eventual release of Donda (named after West’s English professor mother, who died in 2007), there is a nagging sense the spectacle has overshadowed the actual music, with this bloated 108-minute album rarely sure of what it is trying to say. The intro, Donda Chant, a sequence of eerie recitations of his mother’s name seemingly designed to send you into a sunken place, is arresting, giving you the impression you’re about to undergo an immersive religious experience. But too often the songs that follow are built on half-baked ideas from a West more concerned with self-pity and martyrdom than confronting his contradictions.

The mayor of Milan has compared a fire that ripped through a 20-storey residential building on Sunday to the Grenfell Tower blaze in London that killed 72 people four years ago.
The fire, which started on the upper floors of the tower on the southern outskirts of the capital of the Lombardy region, spread to the rest of the building owing to what experts described as the “chimney effect”, which turned the building into a torch.

Closing the Edinburgh international festival after years out of the spotlight, Mvula delivers a triumphant evening of lush 80s soundscapes
Static pours from the speakers on the final night of the Edinburgh international festival. If not for the rolling waves of warmth, rustling like autumn leaves, it could be a soundcheck gone awry. Laura Mvula’s third album Pink Noise is named after precisely this kind of comforting static and as it builds to a crescendo, a waterfall of sound, Mvula steps out into a brief, awed silence.
This moment has been years in the making. If you Google the Birmingham singer, “What happened to Laura Mvula?” is a suggested search. Her 2013 debut Sing to the Moon was a Mobo-winning, Mercury-nominated triumph, combining her church choir background with a crisp, striking sound. It had legends including Prince, Nile Rodgers and David Byrne clamouring to work with her. In 2017 she won the prestigious Ivor Novello album award for her rich second record The Dreaming Room. But despite the acclaim, Mvula was dropped from her Sony record deal – via a forwarded email, no less. She’s spoken frankly about the crisis of confidence that followed, in herself as an artist as well as in the thought of a future in a plainly exploitative pop industry.

Both the 1964 and the 2021 Paralympics opened in extraordinary circumstances. The first Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were seen as Japan’s return to the world stage after it resurrected itself from post-war devastation. The current postponed Paralympics are the first to be held during a global pandemic.

When I moved to Kingston, Jamaica, in 2003 for a job, it was in the month that Lee “Scratch” Perry won the best reggae album Grammy for Jamaican ET, a record that, in true Scratch style, contained everything including the kitchen sink. I remember tuning in to a call-in radio programme during which Jamaicans were wondering who this guy was. It was not entirely surprising – Perry, though arguably the most influential Jamaican artist (and therefore arguably one of the most influential artists ever), is most renowned for his work as producer rather than frontman.
In truth, Perry – who has died aged 85 – was astoundingly skilled and prolific in both roles, and so it would be laughable to attempt any comprehensive “best of” or representative listing of Perry’s work (though you could turn to this good primer by David Katz, author of the exhaustive and essential 2000 biography People Funny Boy: The Genius of Lee “Scratch” Perry). The music he created seems to expand – perhaps explode – all notions of what music can be, so it is more prudent to pick some standouts that demonstrate his breadth and depth than a definitive greatest hits.

Plus a Panorama report called ‘Am I British?’” He forgot to mention The Great British Photography Challenge on BBC Four.

We have had versions of this vibrant, rich-tasting bean salad on the menu at Wahaca since we opened. In late summer, I like to toss in some charred corn, too, which is delicious on a crisp corn tortilla, especially when spread with a garlicky, roast jalapeño aïoli. The dangerously moreish aïoli adds a silky, background note to the whole dish, and an extra lick of flavour: the blend of fresh lime, sparkly chilli heat and umami garlic turns an otherwise wholesome dish into something infinitely more compelling.

A booster jab of Covid-19 vaccine for vulnerable people is not a luxury but a good way to protect them, the World Health Organization has said, as surging infection rates and a pan-European vaccination slowdown produced a “deeply worrying” situation.
“A third dose of vaccine is not a luxury booster taken away from someone who is still waiting for a first jab,” Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s regional director for Europe, said on Monday. “It’s basically a way to keep the most vulnerable safe.”

                    <span>They have become virtually incapable of seeing any solution to any foreign problem that does not include the barrel of a gun
Some of America’s most experienced diplomats, politicians and former generals have been saturating the airwaves in the aftermath of the Taliban’s capture of Kabul issuing dire warnings of what may come next. Many are advocating, even in this final hour, to abandon the withdrawal and return to combat against the Taliban. Such alarmist rhetoric from our senior-most figures does much to explain why America has failed so spectacularly in this war: some of the most influential voices over the past 20 years possess an unhealthy and irrational lust to use war as the first option to solve every foreign problem.
Before 2001, Americans generally thought they were immune from foreign attack. Those beliefs were shattered with the shocking images of the twin towers falling and the Pentagon smoldering on September 11th. In the aftermath, fear and anger descended over the US population. Political leaders and senior military commanders sought to look and sound tough to calm a jittery people.

                    <span>Under-18s will be allowed to play online games for one hour on Fridays, weekends and holidays
China has ordered its online gaming companies to further reduce the services they provide to young gamers, in a move intended to curb what the authorities described as “youth video game addiction”.
Under the new rule, young gamers are only allowed to spend an hour playing online games on Fridays, weekends and holidays, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

                    <span>Bramham Park, Leeds
With thoughts of Covid banished in a blitz of teenage hugging, there are some terrific moments amid this disappointingly male-heavy lineup
“Who fancies a party? We’re all out of the house!” yells Wolf Alice bassist Theo Ellis as this festival – traditionally a post-GCSE blowout, with a simultaneous leg in Reading – returns after its 2020 cancellation. Lateral flow tests and daily health checks are as much part of this year’s festival experience as bucket hats and glitter, but it’s otherwise rather eerily as if the pandemic never happened, with 75,000 attendees – many of them teenagers joyously hugging – and no masks or social distancing. The addition of a second main stage makes for a more continuous flow of music, although Wolf Alice’s triumphant, ethereally powerful teatime slot deserves a later billing.
With music in semi-limbo for 18 months and some high-profile US withdrawals, the scattergun bill combines zeitgeisty YouTubers and drill rappers in the tents with tried and trusted festival staples such as Catfish and the Bottlemen or Two Door Cinema Club on the outdoor stages. Friday headliners Biffy Clyro (late replacements for Queens of the Stone Age) first played in 2001, but the audience haven’t lost their enthusiasm for the topless, bearded, tattooed Scottish rockers and Many of Horror, about togetherness after a struggle, becomes a mass singalong.

                    <span>Pizzette fritte are rustic little snacks comprising deep-fried discs of dough topped with a spoonful of tomato, a little grated parmesan and a basil leaf
One of the most satisfying sights in the kitchen is watching a circle of yeasted dough in very hot oil. First it shimmies, in the same way you might make your way across the function room to the dance floor at a wedding – not quite dancing and all in the shoulders – in a coat of bubbles. Then comes the blistering – small bubbles erupting on its surface, before the big puff – although this usually happens on just one side, which might save you the trouble of turning it over as the pizzetta capsizes, all the time getting more and more golden. I am convinced this is even more exciting if you yourself are impossibly hot. And, of course, there…</span>

                    <span>Zoe, 37, and Tim, 45, met at night school in 2012 and were engaged six weeks later. They live in York with their two dogs
When Zoe split up with her boyfriend in 2012, she had “a bit of an existential crisis”. Though she enjoyed her job as a support worker for a learning disability charity in York, she was keen to explore some of the thoughts she’d been having about life and its meaning, and to try something new. “I wanted to meet people and I’d always been really interested in social sciences,” she says. “So I decided to join an evening philosophy class to learn more.” In the second term, she spotted a man she hadn’t seen before in the coffee room. “The class was mainly women and when I saw him I thought, oh, there’s a hottie in philosophy class!”
Tim had joined the class with his mother. “She really wanted to go, but my dad wasn’t interested,” he says. “I was basically her wingman. I remember being surrounded by women at the class. I was just there to give my mum a bit of confidence.” He thought Zoe was “really attractive” when they saw each other in the coffee room, but it took a while to build up the courage to talk to her.

                    <span>Nicolette Hahn Niman was an environmental lawyer who became a cattle rancher, and didn’t eat meat for 33 years. For both the ecosystem and human health, she argues, it’s how animals are farmed that matters
After refusing to eat meat for 33 years, Nicolette Hahn Niman bit tentatively into a beefburger two years ago. She had become a vegetarian because she was concerned about animal welfare and the environmental cost of meat. Unlike most vegetarians, she had experience of the dire conditions on factory farms during her career as an environmental lawyer campaigning against pollution caused by industrial meat production in the US. Then she married a farmer.
Hahn Niman’s journey from vegetarian activist to cattle rancher to writing a book called Defending Beef may be driven by love, but it is also informed by a lawyerly desire to stick up for small farmers besieged by the growing ethical and environmental clamour against meat. The burger turned out to be an unexpectedly delicious brief pleasure, but it was the 18 years working on the ranch alongside the man who grilled it – and raised the cow – her husband, Bill Niman, that inspired her.

Deborah Stokes said they took legal action over the September 2019 article headlined “tragedy that haunts Stokes’ family” to ensure others did not have to endure similar stories.

People like us are highly motivated by personal growth, and occasionally ruthless in the pursuit. We make difficult partners and parents, but good landscape architects. We are ENTJs: extroverted, intuitive, thinking, judging – also known as the executive type or, sometimes, “the Commander”.

                    <span>The first rule of swordfight club is: don’t die! The second involves aggression – tricky if you’re used to expressing disapproval through quiet tutting and snippy emails
I recently learned there is a Bake Off equivalent for sword making: Forged in Fire, an epic struggle between (almost exclusively) men and hot metal. Each episode climaxes with the show’s Paul Hollywood figure testing blades on a jelly torso filled with fake blood. If your sword wreaks graphic gelatinous carnage, you get the equivalent of a Hollywood handshake: the accolade “Your blade will keal” (which supposedly means it will “keep everyone alive” but that homophone is not accidental). I find the jelly torso slashing deeply, troublingly satisfying, so I’m trying a sword-fighting class at York School of Defence: I want to keal.
We’re using English longswords. “It’s what you would think of as a classic knightly sword – you hold it in two hands,” says Chris Halpin, the head coach and genial pink-haired martial arts expert. Halpin has been teaching Hema (Historical European martial arts) here for nine years. It’s different from historical reenacting, which, he explains, often uses made-up combat for safety reasons. Hema teaches authentic fighting techniques from historical manuscripts: today’s class is mainly based on the 16th-century Ledall Roll.

There was a time when the vast Lake Chilwa almost disappeared. In 2012 it had been extremely hot in southern Malawi, with little rain to fill the rivers that ran into the lake.
“Many fishermen were forced to scramble for land near the lake banks, while others had to migrate to the city,” says Alfred Samuel. “We could barely feed our children because the lake could not provide enough fish, or water for rice growing.”

Empty shelves, missing product lines and the rising sense of a country that may not be able to feed itself: despite still being underplayed by most of the media, the results of Britain’s labour shortages are now ubiquitous.
Fruit growers warn that their crops are simply being left to rot. For want of regular workers, meat-processing plants are set to employ prisoners. The shortage of lorry drivers means that McDonald’s has run out of milkshakes. After 18 months of misery and disruption, most of us seem to be responding with fatalistic shrugs, although the situation also brings to mind a cliched but pointed question: can you imagine the reaction if this was happening under a Labour government?

Never has so much praise been lavished on so dysfunctional a building. The last major project of modernist master Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Berlin’s Neue Nationalgalerie is a perfectly square temple of steel and glass, raised above the street on its own granite acropolis. Built in 1968, not far from the recently erected Berlin Wall, it was intended to symbolise the freedoms of the west, its big black roof enclosing an epic column-free hall for the display of modern art. It has long been venerated as a 20th-century Parthenon, the ultimate example of Mies’s pursuit of “universal space”.
But as a museum, it has always been a disaster. Ever since it opened, the New National Gallery has been dogged by cracking windows, heavy condensation and awkward display spaces, presenting a curatorial nightmare for its staff. Beneath the impractical grand hall are subterranean galleries for the permanent collection that have the dreary feeling of a windowless office complex. It is one of the most extreme examples of the quest for purity of form trumping the demands of function.

Litha María de Los Angeles slaps two cheese-filled pupusas – the El Salvadoran cornmeal flatbread – on the griddle. With a camera click on the QR code, she receives her payment: four hundred-thousandths of a Bitcoin. Then, as the rain pelts the corrugated iron roof and a gust of wind lifts the blue plastic table cloths, the power cuts out.
A tumultuous few weeks awaits El Salvador as it prepares to become the first country to adopt Bitcoin, the world’s most popular decentralised digital currency, as legal tender on 7 September. With that deadline looming, a host of challenges – technological, financial and criminal – threaten to sink the plan of the president, Nayib Bukele, to ride the Central American economy out of its current choppy waters on the back of a cryptocurrency wave.

On 28 May 2016 the photographer Jeff McCurry was taking pictures of a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla called Harambe in Cincinnati zoo when a child entered the enclosure. The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon as a result of McCurry’s picture and social media. Harambe’s image was everywhere. Despite his photo being shared billions of times, however, McCurry did not gain much financially. Since then advances in technology have given the world non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and McCurry has a way of finally cashing in on his famous image.

Archery: The second set goes 28-27 to Stretton. Paterson Pine shoots all nines.

 2.00am BST 
Archery: Pretty rough for the two British archers to be drawn against each other in the 1/8 elimination final. Given it’s a competition with the focus on nations rather than individuals, that does seem like something that could be avoided. But do I know the complexities of archery seeding and draws? No.
Any rate. Phoebe Patterson Pine wins the first set with a couple of 10s, Jessica Stretton shooting 9-10-9 to cede it 28-29.

                    <span>Households prepare offerings in prayer for their ancestors and gods, but many temples are closed 
On the 15th day of Ghost Month, when the gates to hell are believed to open and spirits walk the earth, Taoist masters are invited to the Zhupu Altar, a massive temple built on a hillside in Keelung, northern Taiwan. The masters hold a ceremony to assist the spirits of those who died without family or friends to pray for them, known as “hungry ghosts” but commonly referred to as good brothers and sisters to avoid offence.
Ghost Month is marked across east Asia, including Hong Kong, southern China, Indonesia and Malaysia. In Taiwan, Keelung is a significant site, with a history of violent disputes during the Qing dynasty, and it hosts the island’s biggest events. The ceremonies often draw tens of thousands of onlookers from afar, but these are Covid times.

People with a rare form of diabetes may receive better treatment and discover whether their children are also affected under new plans from NHS England.
Monogenic diabetes is caused by a single gene mutation – although the specific gene affected can differ. The condition occurs in two types, neonatal – which can occur within the first six months of life – and maturity-onset diabetes of the young that develops later, often before the age of 25.

On Sunday US forces launched a military strike against a vehicle said to be carrying “multiple suicide bombers” from Islamic State’s local affiliate who were planning to attack Kabul airport.

Johanna Konta has opened up about her torrid, Covid-19-affected summer, during which she was withdrawn from Wimbledon on the eve of the tournament as a close contact of an infected team member. The British No 1 then contracted the virus herself, ruling her out of the Olympics.
Although she watched the Tokyo Games, Konta says that she could not bring herself to watch Wimbledon while sitting at home in quarantine, and that she had to “make peace with” the frustration of not being able to compete.

                    <span>Martin Compston is in trouble and Jones’s detective must calm the troubled seas, in a murky marine drama that delivers solid, old-fashioned entertainment

Read the first of our episode-by-episode recaps

A nuclear submarine. A dead body. A fishing trawler and her crew dragged beneath the waves by an unseen, unstoppable force. A reactor shutdown. Suranne Jones as a bereaved police detective battening down her grief to get on with the job. Martin Compston (DCI Arnott from Line of Duty) as – well, we’ll get to that. Paterson Joseph as a naval captain whose first duty is to his crew and his mission, not to a murder investigation. The BBC’s new six-part drama has all the ingredients to be an absolute humdinger of a series, and it is. Claustrophobics beware – the submarine scenes are very, very submarine-y, all tiny bunks, narrow corridors and building pressure in all senses of the word – but anyone who can bring themselves to watch will have hours of solid, old-fashioned entertainment delivered unto them.
We begin with the trawler crew, bantering away until something snags them and starts pulling them – not quickly, quite harrowingly – down into the vasty deep. A mile away and beneath, HMS Vigil hears their distress call. Petty Officer Burke (Compston) argues that they should go to the rescue. Captain Newsome (Joseph) insists they must not give away their position or place themselves at the mercy of whatever did for the boat, and Burke is sent to his bunk to calm down.

Under coronavirus rules in Scotland, double-vaccinated adults and all children have to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone with coronavirus unless they can provide a recent negative PCR test and are symptomless. Sturgeon had her second dose of a coronavirus vaccine in June.

Lee “Scratch” Perry – who has died aged 85 – was talking me through perhaps the most significant gear change in the earlier years of Jamaican music – and was understandably animated, even by his own hyperactive standards.

                    <span>Actor and activist who starred as an irascible journalist in The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its spinoff drama series Lou Grant
It is very difficult to separate the character of the eponymous hero of the television series Lou Grant (1977-82) from the actor who played him. Ed Asner, who has died aged 91, will always be associated with the irascible but kindly crusading city editor of the Los Angeles Tribune, although he had a career that stretched back to the 1950s and continued long after Lou Grant was axed.
While the show was running, Asner was an outspoken activist against US support of the junta in El Salvador. He stood on the steps of the state department to announce the formation of Medical Aid for El Salvador and presented the first $25,000 relief cheque for war-ravaged communities there. Dozens of rightwing organisations asked their members to boycott the products that sponsored the show.

Five people have put their arms through the railings and glued their hands together so that they are not damaging the museum’s property. Six have deadlocked their necks against the railings. Some are scientists dressed in lab coats, while others are in clothes with Extinction Rebellion logos.

Ed Asner, a burly and prolific character actor who became a star in middle age as the gruff but lovable newsman Lou Grant, first in the hit comedy The Mary Tyler Moore Show and later in the drama Lou Grant, died on Sunday. He was 91.

A group of powerful investors are preparing a £2bn takeover of one of the UK’s largest port operators in a move seen by some as a vote of confidence in the government’s levelling-up agenda.
The South Tees Development Corporation, which is run by the Tees Valley combined authority and headed by the local mayor, Ben Houchen, has reportedly been preparing a bid for PD Ports, which owns 12 ports and distribution sites across the UK.

“We have been working like fingers on one hand, with different roles, and we came together as a big strong punch,” says the former captain and one of the founders of the Afghanistan women’s national football team, Khalida Popal. She is talking about the small team that pulled off the mission to evacuate 100-200 Afghan athletes and a number of individuals connected to them from the Hamid Karzai international airport in Kabul.
Across a two-week period those fingers worked tirelessly around the clock and across numerous time zones, tracking the real-time movements of the Taliban and military personnel on the ground to pull off what seemed completely impossible: to get a group of female football players, many teenagers, and a host of others, including family members, into the airport and on to planes.

A missile and drone attack on a key military base in south Yemen has killed at least 30 troops, a Yemeni military spokesman said. It was one of the deadliest attacks in the country’s civil war in recent years.
Mohammed al-Naqib, the spokesman for Yemen’s southern forces, said the attack on Sunday on al-Anad airbase in the province of Lahj wounded at least 65. He said the casualty toll could rise since rescue teams were still clearing the site.

                    <span>Broad public support for environmental policies is crucial, writes Colin Hines of Green New Deal UK, while Michael Meadowcroft and Luce Gilmore believe a separate party undermines this
Andy Beckett is right to find some optimism in the record of the exceptional Green MP Caroline Lucas and the party’s growing number of councillors (The Greens are on the brink of power – is it more than a political blip?, 27 August). However, the crucial route to power for green politics lies in cooperation with non-Tory parties to gain enough public support for effective environmental policies.
The government promises much, but there is a dearth of concrete policies. The chancellor hasn’t even announced his green bonds initiative that is supposed to appear this summer. Our research has shown that were savers to be adequately incentivised, this could provide billions to finance the “green new deal”, if it was announced as a green recovery Isa, enabling usually older savers to fund green jobs.

                    <span>Geoffrey Bindman says that without collective action to defend the oppressed and the vulnerable, we are heading into dangerous isolationist territory
Simon Jenkins is right that “moral imperialism” has long been a motivating factor in military interventions by Britain and other western nations (The west’s nation-building fantasy is to blame for the mess in Afghanistan, 20 August). Afghanistan and Iraq are contemporary examples.
But concern about motive does not detract from the need to support and strengthen the international protection of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the framework of international humanitarian law which followed it were endorsed by almost every nation. The absence of an international police force – a weakness in the structure – increases the need for individual states to share responsibility for enforcement, particularly of international criminal law. The development of a “responsibility to protect”, dismissed by Jenkins, gives legitimacy to necessary humanitarian intervention. Military action should be a last resort, but it cannot be ruled out of every situation where lives are at stake.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side were dreadful in the first half and remained disjointed in the second but after withstanding swells of Wolves pressure, Greenwood rattled in his third goal of the season to extend United’s unbeaten start. Somehow, Wolves are pointless and goalless after three matches and this slender defeat was a particular travesty.

The phrase “nobody makes superhero movies like Australia” has, I dare say, never before been written. Our humble government-subsidised film and TV industry is no more than a lemonade stand in the shadow of Hollywood’s arena spectacular, unable to compete budget-wise with the deep pockets of Tinseltown or produce bombast on the scale of American studios.
But scratch the surface of Australian film and TV history and you will find a small but rich vein of super strange locally made superhero productions with their own – forgive me – true blue je ne sais quoi. Their eclecticism and off-kilter energy provides a refreshing counterpoint to the risk-averse kind falling off the Hollywood assembly line.

Does talking to my child about sex have to be a mortifying nightmare?
There doesn’t seem to be a word for “fear of talking to your young children about sex” but it’s a phobia so widespread that surely someone should have coined one by now. But there’s good news: like many phobias, with a bit of deep breathing and some light mental reprogramming it can be overcome.

In the modern state, it is obvious that some government information should remain secret. However, the power to conceal should not be open to abuse so that a government is protected from censure or humiliation, or able to suppress wrongdoing. Yet that is exactly where the state could end up if plans for a new system of secrecy without safeguards are enacted.
In its suggested reforms to the four Official Secrets Acts, the Home Office proposes an extremely hostile environment for journalism. The plans would make it easier to prosecute whistleblowers and more difficult to defend disclosing information that the government says is damaging to national security. Making journalists and sources liable in criminal law will surely deter them from revealing that the government has been up to something disastrous for British interests, or morally appalling, or both. Such plans ought to send a shudder down the spine of all those who care about the public’s right to know.

Leading a growing chorus of business organisations, the Institute of Directors (IoD) called for new, flexible visas that would allow foreign workers to step in to fill crucial roles, particularly as lorry drivers, after an exodus of workers due to Covid and Brexit.

What a difference a year makes. This time last year, the country had not long ceased its weekly clap for carers. This ritual had its detractors (who thought it sentimental, or that extra pay would be preferable), but it focused attention, and gratefulness, on a cohort who were bearing the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The pandemic is not over, but earlier this month a survey found that more than a third of doctors have recently experienced verbal abuse and sometimes physical threats. In hospitals, it was most often nurses who were abused, while 96% of GPs had seen it happen to receptionists. Midwives report being physically threatened. Some NHS workers are beginning to hide their badges in public.

Half-points awarded after shortest F1 grand prix in history

The record books will record the Belgian Grand Prix as a race, and honours were duly awarded, but there was little dignity in how Formula One went about it on a rain-soaked afternoon at Spa-Francorchamps. It was the shortest race in the sport’s history, over in just three laps and eight minutes, all behind the safety car.
Max Verstappen was declared the winner for Red Bull, with George Russell second for Williams and Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes in third. However, in what must count as a farcical determination by F1 to declare a result come what may, none of the drivers actually did any racing.

The figure, drawn up by mental health trusts and NHS Providers, underlines the gap between the growing need for care for anxiety, depression and other mental health problems, and the ability of the NHS to treat them.

Rogge, who spent 12 years as IOC president, awarded the 2012 Games to London in 2005 having also competed at three Olympics for Belgium as a sailor in 1968, 1972 and 1976.

A bit like telling someone you love them and being met with “I love spending time with you, too” in response, Chris Silverwood was asked on Sunday whether Joe Root is a great England captain and replied: “I think he’s a good Test captain, yes.”
It was an amusing answer as England’s head coach reflected on his side’s handsome victory by an innings against India at Headingley, one that ended a run of seven Tests without a win and puts this enticing series level before the fourth Test at the Oval, which begins on Thursday.

Arms aloft, suit jacket on, Michael Gove has been filmed giving it his all in an Aberdeen nightclub after reportedly trying to avoid a £5 entrance fee by stating that he was the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
Footage of the recently separated former Vote Leave supremo throwing shapes at 1.15am at Bohemia nightclub circulated on the internet on Sunday. His hands flailed wildly, and occasionally swung in time to the music, in the clip filmed by a fellow clubber. Friends of Gove denied that he had attempted to avoid paying.

Eric Clapton, a staunch critic of measures designed to tackle the Covid pandemic, has released a song entitled This Has Gotta Stop.
While the song does not directly mention lockdown measures or vaccines, the musician has performed on anti-vaccine songs in recent months. His latest offering has been interpreted by some as an attack on the measures recommended by health officials.

Here is a family animation from Peru that spins a magical tale in the Amazon with a cast of mythological creatures from rainforest legend – and importantly, it’s told from the perspective of indigenous characters. It’s a shame, then, that so much here feels blandly generic, with frantic antics and quirky sidekick characters that kids have seen in a dozen movies before. Just as disappointingly, its plucky heroine Ainbo looks a bit plasticky: she’s a full-of-beans girl in the tradition of Moana – strong-willed and brave of heart – but she reminded me of an LOL Surprise! doll, with her adorable big eyes, cute crop-top and fashiony blunt fringe.
Still, there is a sense of adventure as Ainbo – an apprentice hunter from a tribe deep in uncharted rainforest – strikes out on her own to save the village. (You would too, it looks like a luxury spa resort from a Condé Nast Traveller feature.) The whole place has been cursed by an evil forest demon, the Yacuruna, a shapeshifting plume of black smoke with glowing red eyes (he might be too frightening for little ones).

United Russia, the ruling party that has supported Vladimir Putin through nearly his entire presidency, is expected to maintain a majority of the seats in the next Duma, despite state polling that shows that just 26% of Russians are ready to vote for the party – its lowest rating since 2008.

Paul “Pen” Farthing said on Twitter on Sunday that he had landed at Heathrow after what he had described as the “partial success” of a campaign he and supporters had called Operation Ark, in which he had attempted to secure the evacuation of animals as well as staff and their families.

In florist Keith Dawson’s garden, the predominant colour is green. Hedges of hornbeam line the long alleyways, creating intimate paths that open into a wide lawn with a hawthorn tree at its centre, the focal point of the scheme. Ivy creeps over the floor and cloaks tree trunks, while feathery white goat’s beard, Aruncus, and statuesque angelica fill the beds.
The same sensibility registers inside the house, where the decor is a perfect reflection of its inhabitants’ personalities. An ultra-cool atmosphere reigns in the order of rooms. There’s no sign of country kitsch, and the renovations are meticulous. Every switch or window sash has been considered.

A charity founded by the Prince of Wales has launched an ethics investigation into “cash for access” claims that middlemen took cuts for setting up dinners involving wealthy donors and the heir to the throne.
The Prince’s Foundation said it was taking the allegations “very seriously” after it was claimed that individuals could pay £100,000 to secure a dinner with the charity’s founder and an overnight stay at Dumfries House, his mansion in Scotland. An email was said to reveal that fixers could take up to 25% of the fees, which were intended for the royal’s charity ventures, the Mail on Sunday reported.

                    <span>Poorer countries need to be able to produce their own vaccines. Until that happens, they will be left behind
The Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 is causing major problems across the world. Estimated to be at least twice as transmissible as the original virus, it is challenging the measures that governments took in 2020. Thailand and South Korea are seeing accelerating cases and deaths, after having successfully managed their epidemics last year. New Zealand and Australia find themselves in snap lockdowns. Low- and middle-income countries are struggling to keep their hospitals from collapsing. Delta has changed the game radically: it is almost like managing a whole new virus.
Though, while much of the world struggles, life seems almost normal in Britain. London nightclubs are full of those partying and enjoying themselves without a care in the world. Festivals are going ahead with tens of thousands of revellers. After incessant daily media coverage, Covid-19 has fallen off the front pages, receding into the background. Observing this, it feels as if the pandemic is over for most people.

UK rap’s go-to collaborator makes a strong case for his music not to be pigeonholed with this radio-friendly debut album 
It’s been a frustrating few years for east London singer-rapper Not3s. Since 2017’s viral hit Addison Lee, he has coped with the record industry’s sluggish release schedules by becoming UK rap’s go-to collaborator for the likes of Mabel, Headie One and Tinie. He has also questioned why his blend of Afrobeat, trap and R&amp;B can’t just be labelled pop as opposed to being awkwardly pigeonholed as Afroswing.
As if to prove his point, the first half of this debut proper (there have been mixtapes) prioritises radio-friendly bangers. The bouncy, AJ Tracey-accentuated One More Time playfully riffs on Britney’s biggest hit, while hook-laden summer sizzler Boom Bam is basically one long chorus. Even when things get introspective on the spiritual 3rd Eye, it’s anchored by a billowy, Radio 2-ready chorus.

Afghanistan – live updates

As word of Kabul’s fall to the Taliban spread across Afghanistan, there were few who greeted the news with as much fear as the Hazara Shias. The religious minority in this Sunni majority country were among the most persecuted groups when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, and the memories of the killings, torture and mass executions have not faded.
Signs point to Hazaras once again finding themselves a target of the Taliban. A recent Amnesty report found that Taliban militants were responsible for the murder of nine Hazaras in July, in the village of Mundarakht. Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off.

Hundreds of thousands of people have failed to come forward for their second Covid jab, official data shows, as scientists warned that improving uptake among adults is more crucial than moving on to children’s vaccines or booster shots.
Experts have repeatedly emphasised the need to receive both doses of the coronavirus vaccines as the second jab greatly increases protection against Covid.

                    <span>The climate emergency and state neglect caused this disaster
After the second world war, Greece’s countryside experienced two debilitating human surges – an exodus of villagers, then a most peculiar human invasion of its fringes. These two surges, aided by a weak state and abetted by the climate crisis, have turned the low-level drama of naturally redemptive forest fires into this summer’s heart-wrenching catastrophe.
After heatwaves of unprecedented longevity, wildfires across the summer months have so far destroyed more than 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of ancient pine forests. They have blackened swathes of Attica, scorched parts of ancient Olympia and obliterated north Evia’s magnificent forests – whose rural communities lost their homes, not to mention their livelihoods and landscapes.

But thanks partly to a public art project inspired by its once-great china clay industry, and the impending arrival of a Cornish answer to The Angel of the North, St Austell is enjoying something of a renaissance.

                    <span>Stroll down Britain’s canals these days and you’ll encounter waterside businesses of all kinds trading out of narrowboats. Here, five floating traders share their stories
When Stuart Fenwick first moved to London seven years ago, he spent a lot of time on foot exploring the capital’s towpaths. His wanderings prompted a recurring dream in which he ran a floristry studio aboard a narrowboat. “I’ve been working with flowers since I was 15 and I’ve always wanted a shop, but could never really afford it,” he explains. “The overheads in London are just too high and unfortunately, retail floristry has been in decline for a long time.” Fenwick found the solution in Bria – a 42ft narrowboat that roves the city’s waterways.

In the stormy waters of the North Sea, 15 miles off the coast of Aberdeenshire, in Scotland, five floating offshore wind turbines stretch 574 feet (175 metres) above the water. The world’s first floating windfarm, a 30 megawatt facility run by the Norwegian company Equinor, has only been in operation since 2017 but has already broken UK records for energy output.
While most offshore wind turbines are anchored to the ocean floor on fixed foundations, limiting them to depths of about 165ft, floating turbines are tethered to the seabed by mooring lines. These enormous structures are assembled on land and pulled out to sea by boats.

If this felt like a big, impactful moment then it was surely appropriate. Wheelchair rugby, the sport of smashing and grabbing and sprinting and crashing, is a definitive Paralympic event. It’s a sport of danger and cunning and of absolute granite determination. For the first time, Great Britain are the champions.
Led by Stuart Robinson, the former RAF gunner who lost both his legs to an IED in Afghanistan, and Jim Roberts, who turned to wheelchair rugby during the three years he spent in hospital recovering from bacterial meningitis, Great Britain beat the United States – the most successful nation in the history of the sport – by 54 tries to 49 and led from start to finish.

The material, released by the heat of the sun from seawater, could be called sustainable. Its extraction engages the skills of a local community. You might worry that salt’s well-known habit of dissolving in water could limit its potential as a construction material – might not an inattentive cleaner wash it all away? – but never fear: it has been stabilised with binding agents derived from sunflowers.

Afghanistan – live updates

A former head of the British Army has said it is “unfathomable” that the UK government appeared to have been “asleep on watch” when it came to ensuring the safety of Afghans who helped soldiers and officials.
Gen Lord Richard Dannatt’s comments followed the final flight containing UK troops and diplomatic staff from Kabul, bringing to an end Britain’s 20-year engagement in Afghanistan. The UK’s ambassador to the country, Sir Laurie Bristow, was among those who arrived on Sunday morning at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

Afghanistan – live updates

Fears are growing for a group of Afghan refugees who fled their country last month and made their way to Europe, only to find themselves marooned on the border between Poland and Belarus in a “Kafkaesque” political standoff.
The 32 refugees – women, men, and a child of 15 years old – have been stuck in a small, muddy patch of land between the two countries for almost three weeks with no access to clean water, insufficient shelter and intermittent food supplies, according to a Polish NGO.

The number of job vacancies has topped the 1m level for the first time. Firms are screaming out for staff. Labour shortages abound. Wage growth is accelerating. There are calls from industry lobby groups for the government to ease the pressure by granting more visas for EU workers.
At which point it may be worth taking a second or two to ask a simple question: if labour shortages are driving up the wages of low-paid workers then what is wrong with that?

                    <span>The cook and the film-maker, who struck up a friendship on Twitter, discuss aesthetics, watching and being watched, and the benefits of ageing
Mark Cousins and Nigella Lawson seem, at first, an unlikely pairing. He is an author and film-maker from Northern Ireland, based in Edinburgh, who makes enraptured documentaries about the wonders of cinema. She is one of the most recognisable faces in the food world, a cookery writer and broadcaster who, with each new offering, seals her status as a national treasure.
Looking closer, their friendship – and it’s a relatively recent one, conducted mainly via Twitter – begins to make sense. Cousins approaches everything he sees with unbridled enthusiasm and a sense of almost childlike awe, to which Lawson clearly responds. She shares his love of the movies, particularly Italian cinema, while he is evidently a great fan of her TV work, declaring it “more noticeably aesthetic, more into imagery and feel, than many” food shows. And they are both fascinated by visual allure – its pleasures and many pitfalls.

                    <span>Skills and reasoning are more vital than ever and the internet is taking the place of memorising by rote
Let’s start with the good news: we’re getting brighter. Sadly, not individually as we age, but IQs have risen over time, with new generations having higher reasoning skill scores than their predecessors. This progress on abstract reasoning is in contrast to plateauing or declining scores for retained knowledge such as vocabulary.
Better nutrition or healthcare might explain some of this improvement. But there’s also been a greater focus on skills over knowledge by schools and parents. This was what Michael Gove was pushing against with his focus on children needing to learn basic facts.

                    <span>Late-summer plums lend themselves to many recipes, but you can’t beat a nice cake
At the bottom of the garden, past the old well and the hazel frames of runner beans, was what we grandly called “the orchard”. Hidden among the pear and greengage trees, past the vast Bramley apple and two damsons was an ancient plum tree. It was my favourite tree in the garden, probably my favourite tree ever – its trunk almost bent double, too brittle to climb without snapping a branch and breaking a bone, its bark mottled with sage green lichen.
Each spring there was a mass of blossom and the petals would swirl up in a snowstorm when the wind blew. In late summer the fruit – golden, translucent, a haven for wasps – hung in clusters. I guess it was inevitable that one day, when I had my own garden, I would plant my own.

OnlyFans, a self-described “subscription social network”, announced last week that it would ban sexually explicit content from October. The ban was a shock because, behind the generic branding, such content is perceived to be OnlyFans’ biggest draw.

                    <span>Thanks to the arrival of Nigel Farage at GB News, the veteran newsman now finds himself among the mops and Domestos
A woman I went on a blind date with in 1988 told me that witches she knew would consort with the devil at midnight, on the meadow by the river outside the town where I was a student. Soon after I decided to become a standup comedian, I sought them out, in the shadow of a ruined abbey, where the cursed remains of Henry II’s mistress Rosamund were destroyed in the dissolution. A bearded middle-aged man in a black polo neck and a pentangle pendant, a cliched look he nonetheless owned convincingly, stated terms on which I could be guaranteed to succeed beyond my wildest dreams. And, like a bloody fool, I accepted them. As promised, in 2018 the Times newspaper declared me the “world’s greatest living standup”. But I know the cost of that accolade. Deals with the devil have a habit of turning sour.
In 1930, at the age of 19, the travelling troubadour Robert Johnson stood at midnight, lit by the moon, at the crossroads of Highways 49 and 61, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and sold his soul to Papa Legba in exchange for unprecedented blues power. On 13 June 2021, at the age of 94 and a half, the respected veteran newsman Andrew Neil stood in a studio in Paddington Basin, lit by some battery-operated torches bought from an all-night garage in the Harrow Road, and sold his soul, and his reputation, to GB News chief executive Roberto Rastapopoulos™®. What did Andrew Neil want in exchange for his precious essence? Money? Power? Some hair? And what did Andrew Neil get? Public humiliation, the loss of his hard-won reputation, the chance to play second fiddle to Nigel Farage and a tasty feast of hard cheddar, humble pie and human excrement. And no hair.

In a display cabinet in the recently opened Our Broken Planet exhibition in London’s Natural History Museum, curators have placed a small nugget of dark material covered with faint indentations. The blackened lump could easily be mistaken for coal. Its true nature is much more intriguing, however.
The nugget is a polymetallic nodule and oceanographers have discovered trillions of them litter Earth’s ocean floors. Each is rich in manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper, some of the most important ingredients for making the electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels that we need to replace the carbon-emitting lorries, power plants and factories now wrecking our climate.

In his memoir of having Covid-19, the poet Michael Rosen recalled doctors telling him he had a 50–50 chance of surviving mechanical ventilation.
This advice was optimistic: of ventilated over-70s in the first two waves, almost 70% died. That statistic, and other sobering numbers, is in weekly reports from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) covering around 40,000 critically ill patients with Covid-19. These reports reveal major changes between the first wave up to August 2020 and the far fewer patients in the current wave since May 2021.

During my first week as a newly qualified forensic psychiatrist at Broadmoor, I had to visit one of the wards. At the foot of a staircase, I stepped aside to let a group of patients pass. Another staff member joined me, and we waited as the men, mainly in their 40s and 50s, descended in silence, walking carefully, hands skimming or leaning on the bannister for support. One man caught my attention because he looked like a stock image of Father Christmas, with a big white beard. When they’d gone, my companion turned to me. “Do you know who that was?” I shook my head. “Peter Sutcliffe… you know, the Yorkshire Ripper.”
I remember thinking, with an intake of breath, “So that’s him.” He was one of the hospital’s most notorious patients, that rarest of offenders, a serial killer. I felt shaken for a moment, and then it dawned on me that the shock was that there was nothing to see. He was just a man, not a monster. When detectives in Yorkshire were desperately trying to solve a series of brutal murders of local women, they interviewed Mr Sutcliffe seven times before he was identified as the suspect. They evidently saw nothing to mark him out from any other man.

I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones drummer who died on Tuesday, interviewing him in 2000 for one of his beloved jazz projects. In the interview, I managed to call George Harrison “the bass player of the Beatles”. Still, I got some things right, writing: “Charlie’s the Stone who is so universally well liked that he commands instant respect without trying.”
It soon became apparent when his death was announced that the response was about honouring a great musician – the rock’n’roll legend, the lifelong jazz aficionado – but also a lot more. There was the standard emotional outpouring, the shock and dismay, that sense of grief-ownership that hits you: “Oh no, not Charlie!” However irrational such feelings are (Watts was 80, not 20), it nevertheless stings when one of “your own” artists takes their final bow. But something else was noteworthy: the reaction, immense and heartfelt, was also courteous, genuine, adult.

The following year, the founders declared the camp “women only”, and the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp became one of the longest and most famous examples of feminist protest in recent history.
The camp was set up outside the RAF base to protest against US nuclear weapons on British common land. Facing police and soldiers, the women sang: “Are you on the side of suicide, are you on the side of homicide, are you on the side of genocide, which side are you on?”

Here’s a nice little exclusive for you,” Paloma Faith leans into my voice recorder generously, grinning, “and you’ll like this because it’s about lactation!” We are huddled outside a café on a day that promised sun but delivered rain, and she pulls her jacket around her a bit tighter – on the back, in big letters it reads: IT’S ALL BOLLOCKS.
So, she says, a week ago she put a post on Instagram about her second baby’s aversion to breastfeeding, and minutes later got a call. “‘Don’t bin the milk!’ they said. Six months of milk, I’d been pumping since my baby was born, and a lactation consultant called and told me she’d pick it up, give it to a new mother who couldn’t breastfeed and was beside herself with worry. It was all marked, dated, so I put it in a freezer bag stuffed with ice packs and sent it off.” Does the woman know… “That it’s pop star milk? Nope!”

                    <span>As conventional campsites fill up, more holidaymakers are discovering the  joys of ‘champing’ – and silent nights
Penny Thomas has always favoured adventure holidays over lying on a beach. But this year, with UK destinations in such demand during the pandemic, she found a unique way to avoid the crowds.
Rather than staying in a busy campsite, or trying to get a rare available holiday home, Thomas, her partner Pete Matthews and labradoodle Betty checked into a 13th-century church. “It was the appeal of doing something a little bit different… I hate being disturbed by other people’s noise. You don’t get that when you’re sleeping among the dead,” she says, laughing.

                    <span>Listening to Joe Biden’s words as the US left Afghanistan was to hear echoes of George W Bush from 2001. Is this a crisis destined to repeat itself?
Many who heard President Biden’s pledge to exact revenge for the killing of 13 US Marines in an Islamic State suicide bombing in Kabul last week will have been struck by how closely they resembled the words of George W Bush almost exactly 20 years ago.
“I want justice,” Bush then told a nation traumatised by 3,000 deaths in the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. “And there’s an old poster out west that says, ‘Wanted: Dead or Alive’.” Bush is no longer president and Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks whose face was on the putative poster, died in a US special forces raid 10 years ago. But the rhetoric remains the same. “We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden said on Thursday. Such language is unavoidable for the leader of a nation that retains and promotes a “frontier culture”, as a veteran CIA official told me last week, but it signals much more too.

A mountain lion that attacked a 5-year-old boy in southern California has been shot and killed by a wildlife officer, authorities say.
The 65-pound (30kg) mountain lion attacked the boy while he was playing near his house on Thursday in Calabasas and “dragged him about 45 yards” across the front lawn, said Captain Patrick Foy, a spokesman with the California department of fish and wildlife, on Saturday.

Two-thirds of voters in Northern Ireland believe there should be a vote over its place in the UK, but only 37% want it to take place within the next five years, according to a new poll for the Observer.
Some 31% of voters said there should be a vote at some point about Northern Ireland’s place in the UK but after 2026, the LucidTalk poll found. A further 29% said there should never be such a vote. There is currently a seven-point lead for Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK should any vote take place.

                    <span>In lockdown in Galway City, Burke focused on the bright side – creating gaudily retro, deadpan tableaux with his parents in all the starring roles
Enda Burke spent lockdown with his parents in Galway City on the west coast of Ireland. As a street photographer, with street life on hold, he decided to focus on the people closest to hand. The result is an award-winning series, Homebound With My Parents, which turns lockdown into theatre. His luminously exuberant colourscape – candyfloss pink, sunflower yellow and turquoise – offers “an antidote to the gloom of Covid”. It’s a bid for “vibrancy, humour, a form of escapism”. To pull this bright new world off, Burke turned the family home upside down and meticulously constructed each set himself. He ordered his retro items online, put up wallpaper and drilled his parents into their new lockdown roles.
When I cross-question him about how they reacted to this hijacking, the 33-year-old reports that his parents are “very easygoing”, and says they had many laughs together. “I said to them, ‘You’re being actors – this is acting and people really love that.’” In an introduction to his series, he reveals a fascination with the “monotony associated with family life during the pandemic”, but life in Galway City during the creation of these photographs seems to have been anything but monotonous.

The headline act at this summer’s photography festival in Arles is an exhibition devoted to the young black photographers who are – literally – changing the face (and bodies) of fashion photography. The New Black Vanguard features the work of Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover, and Dana Scruggs, who achieved the same extraordinarily overdue milestone at Rolling Stone, when she photographed the rapper Travis Scott in 2019.
Scruggs, born in Chicago and based in New York, started out photographing vintage clothes and furniture for her own Etsy store a decade ago. In 2016, frustrated by the continuing lack of diversity in advertising and fashion, she crowdfunded the launch of her own magazine, SCRUGGS, to showcase her distinctive ways of expressing light and movement, focusing on the black male body. “There’s a fearfulness of black men in American society and globally,” Scruggs said. “I wanted to change the narrative.”

These are just some of the most visible signs of Britain’s deepening supply chain crisis, which has seen stocks in shops and warehouses slump to their lowest levels since the Confederation of British Industry began surveying in 1983.

Now it has taken me all the way through the process before telling me I am 78 miles away from my order.

A former Royal Marine who founded an animal shelter in Kabul left an expletive-laden message for a government aide as he sought to place his staff and pets on a flight out of Afghanistan, according to reports.
The Times newspaper said it had obtained a leaked audio recording of Paul “Pen” Farthing berating Peter Quentin, a special adviser to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, who he accused of “blocking” efforts to arrange a flight.

Manager believes team must be better at retaining possession

There is no doubt Mason Greenwood meets the criteria for those who fuel Gareth Southgate’s optimism for the 2022 World Cup. “We’ve got some very exciting attacking players, many of whom aren’t yet the finished article,” said the England manager when announcing his squad for the latest round of qualifiers on Thursday and, with it, a contradiction at the heart of the Manchester United striker’s omission.

Thousands of emails to the Foreign Office from MPs and charities detailing urgent cases of Afghans trying to escape from Kabul have not been read, including cases flagged by government ministers, the Observer has been told.
The UK’s Afghanistan evacuation concluded on Saturday night with the departure of Britain’s final military and diplomatic personnel, bringing a sudden end to the 20-year deployment. More than 15,000 people have been brought out of the country in the last fortnight, in what ministers described as the largest UK military evacuation since the second world war.

Estonia is gearing up for an unusual presidential election in parliament. There will be only one candidate in Monday’s vote, a situation unprecedented since the Baltic state regained its independence 30 years ago.
President Kersti Kaljulaid’s five-year term expires on 10 October, and lawmakers in the 101-seat Riigikogu parliament must elect a new head of state to replace her in the largely ceremonial post.

‘I did not like the way the referee checked only the image’

Thomas Tuchel admitted he was disappointed with the referee Anthony Taylor’s decision to show Reece James a red card and award a penalty to Liverpool after seeing Chelsea’s 100% start to the season ended at Anfield.
Tuchel’s side had seemed on course to earn a third successive victory to start the new season after Kai Havertz’s brilliant header had given them the lead in the first half. But having come close to extending their lead, James was dismissed after appearing to partially block Sadio Mané’s shot on the stroke of half-time, with Mohamed Salah scoring the penalty to earn Liverpool a 1-1 draw.

                    <span>Collagen supplements are booming, but there is mixed advice on whether eating the protein offers anything more than a healthy, balanced diet
To fulfil our culture’s relentless drive for wrinkle-free skin and an eternal youthful glow, collagen supplements have been gaining more attention, fuelling a booming industry. How well do they work? The short answer: there is evidence that eating collagen may be effective, but experts say we can get what we need through a healthy diet.
There’s no doubt this protein – the most abundant in the body – is important. Collagen is derived from the Greek word kólla, meaning glue, and makes up around three quarters of the skin. More than skin-deep, collagen provides structure for bodily organs, blood vessels, teeth, bones, cartilage, tendons and ligaments (its properties have even been exploited for an assorted array of innovations including glue, musical instrument strings, fabrics and rope baskets).

Andy Murray hopes that more players choose to be vaccinated over the coming months as tennis faces a possible reckoning over its rate of inoculation among tour professionals, which is widely believed to be below 50%.
Murray, who faces Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round of the US Open on Monday, was speaking in the wake of the USTA announcing on Friday that all fans must have received at least one dose in order to enter the grounds. As such, the only unvaccinated people in the stadiums will be many of the players on court.

Omar Hassan Abu al-Nile was hit last Saturday on the sidelines of a demonstration near the border fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said. He “succumbed to his injuries”, Gaza’s health ministry said in a statement. About 100 mourners attended his funeral in the afternoon.

They warned that the reopening of schools in England this week was likely to trigger further rises in Covid cases – with more to follow when students return to universities and colleges. A fresh wave of infections could, in turn, lead to new social restrictions being imposed as winter approaches.

Yet Ghulam, his wife and their two children – an 18-month-old daughter and three-year-old son – are today in hiding in Kabul, terrified for their lives. Their first attempt to reach the hotel ended at a Taliban checkpoint. A second was abandoned over safety concerns as Ghulam and his wife carried their children through febrile crowds outside the airport.

They cannot stop emoting. If they did, it’s not just that they would lose money as surely as a supermarket chain would lose if it closed its stores for a summer holiday. They would lose relevance.

Refugee charities and Afghan community organisations are struggling to cope with the demand for their services, with thousands of refugees arriving in the UK in recent days.
For the fourth day in succession about 600 Afghan refugees, including unaccompanied minors, have lined the streets of a nondescript west London business park to access clothes, translation services and immigration advice.

Afghanistan athletes Zakia Khudadadi and Hossain Rasouli will take part in the Tokyo Paralympics after being safely evacuated from Kabul. The pair looked set to miss the event following the Taliban’s return to power in their native country but arrived in the Japanese capital on Saturday via a week-long stay in Paris.

What is the best way to deal with critical customer feedback? Well, Joan, a veteran academic at the fictional Pembroke College, an almost-Ivy League American university, knows exactly what to do with it. She quietly puts a match to reams of negative student evaluations of her work.
It is an amusing, angry scene that takes place inside her grim, cellar-like university study and occurs somewhere towards the middle of new six-part television drama The Chair. But it is also a moment that sits right at the show’s emotional core. Joan is clearly doing wrong, but her diminished status as an ageing, overlooked lecturer makes her a sympathetic figure.

I used to go to a barber who believed he had once been abducted by aliens. Regular in-the-mirror conversation starters – “been away this year?”, “did you see the match last night?” – would generally return to that formative moment when the “grey figures” appeared at the foot of his bed.
“To be honest, I’ve found flying quite tough since the abduction,” he would say over my shoulder, with hangdog matter of factness. Or, breaking off from his clipping: “It’s strange but I’ve not been so into football since I was ‘taken up’.”

He thought it would last a year at most, but Charlie Watts’s run as drummer with the Rolling Stones lasted nearly six decades. This weekend surviving band members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood united to bid a public farewell to the man whose rhythms powered their many hits, who died last Tuesday aged 80.
After commenting individually on the loss last week, the Stones have released a video tribute featuring key moments of Watts’s career. The two-minute clip, posted on social media, includes an interview in which the drummer, a lorry driver’s son from Wembley, revealed that when he joined the band in 1963, he thought it might last a year.

                    <span>Artist William Mullan’s obsession with apples began in Waitrose in Esher, Surrey. An American kid who moved a lot with his dad’s job, Mullan’s eye was first caught by the Egremont Russet. “It was the ugliest apple I had ever seen. It looked like a gold-sprayed potato. I had to have it. When I ate one, I was overwhelmed, with layers of flavour conjuring the warm cider I drank in the midwest, the roast chestnut stands in London, and the feeling of rolling in rust-coloured leaves on a crisp autumn day.” 
Mullan is now a Brooklyn-based brand director for a chocolate-maker, but he still finds time for fruit. His Technicolor, sensuous photographic series Odd Apples is now available as an art book (Hatje Cantz Verlag, £18).

                    <span>Power from fusion has proved too hard to generate at scale. Can recent breakthroughs and massive investment change that?
On 8 August 2021, a laser-initiated experiment at the United States National Ignition Facility (NIF), based at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, made a significant breakthrough in reproducing the power source of the stars, smashing its own 2018 record for energy released from nuclear fusion reactions 23 times over. This advance saw 70% of the laser energy put in released as nuclear energy. A pulse of light, focused to tiny spots within a 10-metre diameter vacuum chamber, triggered the collapse of a capsule of fuel from roughly the size of the pupil in your eye to the diameter of a human hair. This implosion created the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure needed for atoms of hydrogen to combine into new atoms and release, kilogram for kilogram, 10m times the energy that would result from burning coal.
The result is tantalisingly close to a demonstration of “net energy gain”, the long sought-after goal of fusion scientists in which an amount greater than 100% of the energy put into a fusion experiment comes out as nuclear energy. The aim of these experiments is – for now – to show proof of principle only: that energy can be generated. The team behind the success are very close to achieving this: they have managed a more than 1,000-fold improvement in energy release between 2011 and today. Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said last month that “The pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kickstart the process.”

Boris Johnson must wish he owned a time machine to transport him beyond what is shaping up to be one of the most difficult autumns faced by any prime minister. Events in October and November are about to set the tone for the rest of the parliament and the premiership of our once brazen, and now rather bedraggled, PM.
The list of promises that will transform the UK into a 21st-century economic powerhouse are long and costly, and most of them are tied closely to Johnson’s personal ambitions. He has told us that his government will transform the education system, the skills base and the social care system, and “level up” the regions. Backlogs of NHS operations will be cleared and the path to net zero carbon emissions charted.

The Taliban has deployed extra forces and almost sealed off Kabul airport following the carnage that erupted after a suicide bomber detonated explosives into the crowd, killing 169 Afghan civilians and 13 US soldiers.
On Saturday, Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul remained under a high security alert, with the US telling any citizens still queuing at the gates to leave immediately. The Taliban also began efforts to tightly secure the whole area around the airport. Extra Taliban forces, many armed with US military equipment, were deployed to set up new layers of checkpoints and blocked all routes to the gates, bringing some order to a previous place of terror and chaos.

                    <span>As the high school comedy returns for a third series, its Bafta-winning star talks about stage fright, embarrassing scenes, and the torment that lay behind her desire to please people
In June, Aimee Lou Wood, 26, won a Bafta for best female performance in a comedy programme for her role as another Aimee (a teenager) in the hit Netflix show Sex Education, about a set of sexually active high school students, now returning for a third series. Even before the Bafta, Wood was always being stopped in the street. Fans wanted to talk to her, about Sex Education, about everything, because they related to her so strongly. Wood is naturally so friendly, she’d engage in conversation and make herself late. Then she starred opposite Bill Nighy in the forthcoming Oliver Hermanus film, Living: “Obviously, every single person recognises Bill Nighy, and he handles it with such grace,” Wood says, when we meet to talk in a north London photo studio. “With people in the street, I was like [she mock hyperventilates]: ‘Did I say the right thing? Was I nice enough?’ Now I’m learning to be: ‘Thank you so much!’ and carry on walking.”
It’s easy to see why fans relate to Wood: never mind the dazzling prettiness, she’s sparky, warm and expressive. She comes from a working-class family in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and although, following her parents’ divorce, her mother’s new partner paid for her to attend a private secondary school, she kept her rich Mancunian tones: “I sound like my mum and I like that. I like that I sound like where I’m from.”

When they were children they lined the streets in their witch hats and capes, keen to pick up the latest Harry Potter title as bookshops opened their doors at midnight. Now they are a little older, the prospect of a tussle with some millennial emotions could see them queuing around the block again on 7 September, as dozens of bookshops plan to open early for the arrival of Sally Rooney’s latest novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You.
In a nationwide promotional push, prompted by signs of big public demand, freshly printed copies of the Irish author’s third novel are to be served to customers with special commemorative merchandise as they enjoy a coffee and pastry.

Four rivals are vying for the 10-year licence to run the national lottery, a lucrative contract that has been the sole preserve of Canadian-owned Camelot for nearly three decades.
Czech-owned Sazka Group, which runs lotteries in Greece, Italy and Austria as well as its home country, is seen as the greatest threat to Camelot’s castle walls. It has recruited some boardroom heavyweights to help in its attempt to breach them, via a new UK venture called Allwyn.

Employers have been told to invest in UK-based workers rather than relying on labour from abroad as supermarkets and suppliers struggle to contend with a chronic shortage of lorry drivers caused by the exodus of hauliers from EU countries because of Brexit and Covid.
The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote to business leaders on Friday saying foreign labour only offered “a short-term, temporary solution” after industry groups, Logistics UK and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) called on the department to provide temporary UK visas to EU truck drivers. They said the lack of drivers was “increasingly putting unsustainable pressure on retailers and their supply chains”.

                    <span>After a summer of free entry, visitors will now have to pay up to £8 to climb the London project. But will they bother?
It has been called a “BTec Eiffel Tower” and a “slag heap”. It’s been compared to “a car-park Santa’s grotto, with dogs pretending to be reindeer”. The Marble Arch Mound, the temporary artificial hill commissioned by Westminster city council as an “ambitious” visitor attraction, has become, as a representative of the local community put it, “an international laughing stock”.
The council responded to criticism by allowing free entry during August, and a certain number of the curious and the ghoulishly fascinated have turned up. This week it will start charging again. Given fundamental flaws in the project’s conception, the question is whether people will want to pay £8 for a weekend fast-track ticket now, any more than they did when it first opened at the end of July.

                    <span>Nia DaCosta’s visually impressive take on the cult 1992 film gives it a meta art-world twist
In Bernard Rose’s original 1992 horror film, a white female graduate student investigated the Candyman myth and the site of his haunting – Chicago’s Cabrini-Green housing project – as part of her research. Director Nia DaCosta’s smart, stylish “spiritual sequel”, co-written and produced by Jordan Peele, reimagines its protagonist as a Black artist. In this version, Anthony (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) mines creative inspiration from the tale of a killer ghost who appears when his name is uttered five times in the mirror.
DaCosta’s visual flair is apparent, from the way she details flesh turning to rotten honeycomb, to the visceral squelch of pressing open a wound. Candyman’s attacks are inventively mounted too, playing out in the reflections of floor-to-ceiling windows and a teenage girl’s compact mirror. Anthony says his paintings “focus on the body”, a self-conscious allusion to the way the director leans into body horror too.

The Observer has been contacted by teachers who say they have had to empty water out of their keyboards in the morning, move tables and chairs each day to avoid puddles and ask children to wear coats inside in winter as a result of unsuitable buildings in dire need of repair.

Occasionally, it happens with a Jed Mercurio drama, sometimes with an ill-advised interview inexplicably offered up by a member of the royal family, but television’s ability to conjure up a must-see moment has been waning for years, fragmented into endless options by on-demand and smartphones.
Yet in my family, Gogglebox is essential viewing. When it’s in season, there is almost always a post-match discussion, a dissection of the highlights, who was funny, what they loved and that debate about whether the celebrity version is a meagre substitute for watching normal people having a chat and a laugh about what’s happened in the world that week.

                    <span>I never meant to become a restaurant reviewer for life. But I found everything I needed is there in what we eat
My father was not a big eater. “I’d be happy if I could just take a pill for my lunch,” he once told me, when I was eight or nine years old. I had already concluded that the adult world could be wilfully baffling, but this seemed unnecessarily provocative. It felt like a betrayal. As a child, an unfocused mess of fat-softened limbs and round edges, I knew that food was great. I loved bacon sandwiches on white bread and chocolate éclairs, and lived for evenings when my parents were short on time and dinner was the convenience of Findus Crispy Pancakes filled with delicious, if unidentifiable, brown matter.
Happily, my mother was not interested in getting her nutrition from a pill. Claire wanted both to feed and be fed. On Saturday lunchtimes, after they had done the weekly shop, my mother would fill the kitchen table with cold cuts and cheeses, and plates laid with slippery ribbons of smoked salmon in the brightest shade of orange. There would be dense fish balls, chopped liver topped with crumbled egg and bagels, for we were Jews through food. There was no space in our lives for God, but there was lots of space for lunch. It was a meal called “Fick and Porridge”, an adapted Spoonerism of pick and forage. It was one of those family jokes which isn’t funny to anybody else or even, eventually, to the family who coined it, but which sticks. What mattered was the intent expressed in the name: this was a knowingly relaxed lunch. It was also a form of open house to which certain close family friends knew they were always invited. And so they would come.

The Glaswegian trio use horror film tropes to explore fame, double standards and battles closer to home on their intense fourth album
In 1992, the US film professor Carol J Clover published Men, Women and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film (Princeton University Press). In it, she introduced the concept of the “final girl”, a female protagonist who survives the bloodbath to take on the slasher in the closing scenes. If the final girl is heroic, she is also a problematic figure, kept alive by the film-maker because of her sobriety or chastity while other women who have more fun get the axe. The sequel makes the final girl’s victory pyrrhic anyway.
Midway through Screen Violence, Chvrches’ intense fourth album, a song called Final Girl puts the well-worn horror trope to a more personal use. Lauren Mayberry – mouthpiece of the Glaswegian synth-pop trio – doesn’t want to “end up in a bodybag”. In 2019, Chvrches co-authored a huge tune, Here With Me, with Marshmello. The EDM DJ then went on to work with Chris Brown, the rapper convicted of violently assaulting Rihanna.

Anger is a funny emotion. That’s how I accidentally got my consumer show. In my stand-up set, I’d read out my complaint letters. My genuine fury about minor injustices got laughs. It grew from there. Basically, a parking fine in York ended up making me loads of cash. It’s paid for itself many times over.
I learned to make pasta in lockdown. I did all the bread-baking clichés too – banana bread, soda bread, sourdough – but pasta was my great victory. I got really good at it, as my waistline will attest. Except for ravioli. My meaty parcels kept falling open.

Offices and schools about to reopen - but will commuters return?
Six ways to improve your train journey to work

As September approaches, employers are increasingly asking workers to come in, with many offices adopting hybrid systems after months of working from home – prompting mixed emotions. Commuting can be both expensive and polluting. UK workers pay more of their salary in commuting costs than their EU counterparts and, before the pandemic, two-thirds of people travelled to work by car. But despite the costs, which also include time, some value the commute for separating their home and work lives.
Seven people speak about how their commutes and their perspectives on travelling to work have changed since the onset of the pandemic

How and when did human language evolve? Did a “grammar module” just pop into our ancestors’ brains one day thanks to a random change in our DNA? Or did language come from grooming, or tool use, or cooking meat with fire? These and other hypotheses exist, but there seems little way to rationally choose between them. It was all so very long ago, so any theory must be essentially speculation.
Or must it? This is the question presented as an elegant intellectual thriller by The Dawn of Language: Axes, Lies, Midwifery and How We Came to Talk. Its author is Sverker Johansson, a serene and amiable 60-year-old Swede who speaks to me over Zoom from his book-crammed home study in the city of Falun, where he works as a senior adviser at Dalarna University.

                    <span>Soon after 9/11, I moved into an old building by Ground Zero. First step? Plant an unlikely patch of green
If you listen, I mean really listen, you will hear your garden speaking to you. Mine, which sits on a 10th-floor Manhattan terrace, a stone’s throw from where the World Trade Center stood, first spoke to me on a crisp September morning 20 years ago. I had jury duty that day and decided to walk the two miles south from my home in Greenwich Village down to the courthouse in the financial district.
But when I turned south on to 6th Avenue, I looked up to see see an orange hole flaming at the centre of the tower ahead of me. A woman nearby fell to the pavement, screaming something about a plane. It didn’t seem like a good day to go downtown; yet something compelled me to continue south. When I arrived at a gas station on Canal Street, a boom sounded and a puff of smoke issued from just behind the tower. “What was that?” I asked a taxi driver, filling his tank nearby. “Well, see those two buildings are connected with pipes,” he said with the unquestionable authority endemic to New York cabbies. “When you get a fire in one it spreads and you get a fire in the other.” Makes sense, I thought, and pushed southwards.

I’m on a walk with my mum – it’s way too early to be awake. The path is wet with morning dew. Flowers stand still in a breezeless field. Then, movement. A splash of colour – I squint. Over there, settling on a branch, a bird turns its head. Beady eyes look into mine as we regard each other. My mum powers on, oblivious. Is there a bird as bewitching as this? Its song is as gentle and enchanting as the soft bubble of a brook. I am enthralled by the beauty of the colours that decorate its small body. Beautifully adorned with an array of alluring yellows and crimsons.

It’s that back-to-school/back-to-work weekend, when the gears suddenly shift, especially for those who are returning to the office for the first time in ages. It can all be a bit of a bump, this great return, but it’s one that can be softened by some tasty work lunches: things that can be made the night before, or moreish snacks that keep well for days, ready to be nibbled on. The desk might be clean-slate clear, but there’s no harm in a few flakes of pastry or crumbs from some brittle to help ease the transition.

In December 2019, hospitals in Wuhan, China, reported that they were dealing with dozens of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause. They soon identified the disease as being caused by a novel coronavirus.
Teresa Lambe, associate professor, Jenner Institute My brother lived in China, so whenever there was an emerging or break pathogen there, I used to follow it. I remember thinking very early on that this was probably another influenza strain.

Over the past year, the content subscription service OnlyFans exploded in popularity, as people in numerous countries around the world faced lockdowns amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the site hosts a variety of content, it has been particularly popular with sex workers, who have few centralised platforms to choose from beyond traditional porn sites.
Therefore it was only natural that the company’s announcement last week that it would stop supporting sexually explicit content provoked outrage from sex workers, free expression activists and consumers alike – leading to a surprising about-face from OnlyFans on Wednesday.

                    <span>When her partner left her with a newborn one dark Finnish winter, Anna Härmälä didn’t crumble. Inspired by Fleabag, she turned her pain into raw, funny cartoons
“It’s Finnish winter in complete darkness, and it’s raining ice. And then you can’t sleep, and the baby is screaming, and you’re too tired to get up, but if you don’t get up, there is no one else there.” Anna Härmälä is describing February 2015, when her partner walked out on her and their five-week-old baby. In order to remember, she has to inhabit the “brutal darkness” of that time. “There was extreme tiredness, a deep sadness, moments of despair – but also moments of great love and purpose. That first year was a crazy rollercoaster. It was absolutely… ” She pauses, and breathes in, searching for the right word. What is the word for how it feels when your partner has an affair and abandons you with a newborn? How do you explain it? Härmälä, a Finnish art teacher and children’s book author, started drawing comics.
The comics are raw and funny and painful, thrusting the reader straight into the moment of crisis: Härmälä, ravaged with tiredness, contemplating the droopiness of her breasts and eyebags; intimate conversations with friends; snapshots of the messy loneliness of life stranded with a newborn. The drawings feel so immediate that it’s easy to believe you are reading the story in real time – yeah right, as if a newly single mother, desperately trying to survive, would be likely to sit down each day and create beautiful narrative art about it.

“It was not our intention to discover a new island,” polar explorer and head of the Arctic station research facility in Greenland, Morten Rasch, said of the find last month. “We just went there to collect samples.”

 1.50am BST 
Earlier on Friday, US President Joe Biden’s national security team told the president that another terror attack is “likely” in Kabul, and that “maximum force protection” measures are being taken at the airport in the Afghan capital.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not go into detail on the assessment Biden received from his team one day after a suicide bomber killed 13 US service members and scores of Afghans outside the airport.
Psaki says the next few days of the mission to evacuate Americans and vulnerable Afghans fleeing Taliban rule “will be the most dangerous period to date.”
Biden has said that he intends to complete the evacuation by his Tuesday deadline.
 1.31am BST 
The statement posted to the US Embassy in Afghanistan website reads: 
Because of security threats at the Kabul airport, we continue to advise U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates.
U.S. citizens who are at the Abbey gate, East gate, North gate or the New Ministry of Interior gate now should leave immediately.

Table tennis: Ross Wilson loses his composure late against Nikolenko. Has several chances to take the third game, an arm wrestle that the Ukrainian eventually claims to lead 2-1. Then Wilson tenses up in the decisive game. Doesn’t play with confidence. A few tentative little shots, a lot of errors missing long, and Nikolenko doesn’t have to hit many winners to go into a semifinal and (in this format) a guaranteed bronze medal.

Hurricane Ida rapidly gained strength on Friday evening as communities in southern Louisiana braced for a major category 4 storm with sustained winds of about 140mph and tens of thousands of residents were placed under mandatory evacuation orders.
The hurricane is due to make landfall in the US on Sunday, with officials warning of a “life-altering storm”. The cities of New Orleans and Lafayette, as well as the state capital, Baton Rouge, are under threat from Ida, which is forecast to reach the US somewhere between the parishes of Terrebone and St Mary, slightly west of New Orleans.

The report, issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to Joe Biden’s request, said a satisfying answer to the question of how a virus that has killed 4.6 million people worldwide started remained out of reach.

                    <span>Outbreak of Delta Covid cases likely to put strain on health services in areas with low vaccination rates, experts say

Coronavirus – latest updates

The Delta variant doubles the risk of Covid hospitalisation compared with the previously dominant Alpha variant, a new study focused largely on unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people has found.
The analysis – based on data collected in England – suggests that outbreaks of the Delta variant are likely to put an additional strain on health services, particularly in places with low rates of vaccination.

Single-use plastic plates and cutlery, and polystyrene cups will be banned in England under government plans, as it seeks to reduce the plastic polluting the environment.
A public consultation will launch in the autumn and the ban could be in place in a couple of years. The move was welcomed by campaigners, but they said overall progress on cutting plastic waste was “snail-paced”, with the EU having banned these items and others in July.

The change in Chelsea this season may not be limited to the older, wiser, £97.5m focal point of their attack. As Liverpool can testify, there is nothing like a Champions League triumph for the momentum required to land the Premier League title, too.
Similarly to his Liverpool title winners in 2020, could Saturday’s visitors to Anfield transfer the confidence that comes with reigning in Europe into a sustained fight for Manchester City’s domestic crown? “I hope not, but it’s possible,” Jürgen Klopp says.

From September – more than nine months after it was approved for emergency use in the United States – the first doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine will arrive on Australian shores. The second mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine against the coronavirus is a welcome boon amid a period of rolling lockdowns and record case numbers.
But Australia’s notoriously sluggish vaccine rollout has been marred by the failure of a locally developed vaccine candidate, as well as changes to age-group recommendations for the AstraZeneca vaccine as a result of its link to rare but blood clots.

A loud bang shatters the winter calm of Port Ross, in New Zealand’s remote Auckland Islands, and the small inflatable boat is rocked by the swirl of a 40-ton whale being swallowed up by the cold, dark water.
When it resurfaces, the team of scientists are happy to see their US$3,200 satellite tag securely fixed to his side. The whale, whom they have nicknamed “Bill”, slips away into the ocean, the tag transmitting his movements. A few days later, researchers watch as he starts heading west towards Australia.

The Frenchman, traditionally a one-day classics specialist, was working with his Deceuninck-QuickStep teammates to set up Fabio Jakobsen for the sprint finish, but the Dutchman suffered a flat tyre and urged Sénéchal to push for the win instead.

Away from the Wimbledon crowds, the spotlight and any wildcards as in her breakthrough run to the round of 16 there last month, Raducanu gave a comprehensive demonstration of her potential by breezing through the difficult qualifying draw without dropping a set. She was later joined in the main draw by Katie Boulter, the 25-year-old from Leicester, after she beat Slovakia’s Kristina Kucova 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 in their qualifying tie.

Olivia Miller dazzles in this tart and punky solo show, which reimagines the Tudor monarch as an in-yer-face Gen-Z teen
You might consider the fraught life of Mary Tudor, England’s first queen, for a long time before thinking: standup comedy. But that’s the leap Olivia Miller has made with this punky solo, first performed in her home town of New York. It reimagines Mary as an in-yer-face Gen-Z teen, back from the dead to reprise her lurid life story, defend her name and justify that small matter of 280 heretics burned alive.
She makes a good fist of it. In fishnets and bovver boots, Miller shows off her standup chops, if not always in the quality of the jokes then in the dazzle and charm with which she brings her crowd on side. The repeated technique is to mine inappropriate intimacies (“raise your hand if you’ve imagined your parents having sex?”), then demonstrate how our experiences can’t touch hers. Her parents’ sex life is a matter of national debate, while Mary is put on the marriage market from two years old. Her mum is then exiled, never to be seen again, while dad upends a kingdom, affronts God and murders multiple wives, all to right the wrong of Mary’s unsatisfactory gender.

The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. It’s a good line – an inspirational quote for a tea towel or a meme, very much the tea towels of the Instagram age.
The quote itself actually comes from John Stuart Mill’s inaugural address at St Andrews University in 1867: “Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.” It’s unlikely Mill was thinking of tea towels or memes when he said it. Nor you suspect was he referring to how Gary Rowett might be feeling a century and a half later. But the Millwall manager now finds himself in the unenviable position of being a good man looking on.

It was a luxurious slow burn of a third day at Headingley, one of those days when the moments all seem to blur into a kind of ambient hum, a day when nothing is wasted and nothing is resolved, when everything is moving but nobody is going anywhere. India’s batters seemed content to mark out time; England’s bowlers and fielders ran in with purpose but little urgency; the clouds drifted; the electronic advertising boards quietly scrolled their wares.
Partly this was a function of the surface, slow and lifeless and seemingly in no hurry at all. Partly it was the state of the match, with England dominant and India playing largely for pride and thoughts already beginning to turn to the Oval and Manchester. Partly it was a function of the serene Cheteshwar Pujara, who is the sort of batsman who slows the game to his own pace: batting until one can no longer remember a time before he started batting nor can envisage a time when he no longer will be.

Secondary school and college pupils will need to wear face masks in communal areas outside their classrooms yet again in parts of south-west England as extra support was pledged in response to a rise in coronavirus cases.
The Department of Health and Social Care said that from Friday, Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, Devon, Plymouth and Torbay local authority areas, which have recorded a rise in cases, would get help to increase vaccine and testing uptake and deliver more public health messaging.

Some of China’s most valuable public companies could abandon their American stock listings within months, experts have warned, after reports emerged that Beijing is planning a wider crackdown on tech companies going public overseas.
The development means that more than $2tn (£1.5tn) of capital invested in the US shares of Chinese companies could be at risk.

Fear and fury in Kabul as thousands face being abandoned by UK
‘We feel hopeless now’: the British nationals left behind in Kabul

As the final hours available to British officials to get people out of Afghanistan appear to be slipping away, those who fear for their lives if they are left behind are becoming ever more frantic in their efforts to escape as their relatives in the UK grow increasingly panicked for them.
The identities of those who spoke to the Guardian have been concealed to protect them and their relatives.

Losing weight through exercise appears to be more difficult for obese people, research suggests.
Initially, researchers thought that the total energy we spend in a day is the sum of energy expended due to activity (ranging from light gardening to running a marathon) and energy used for basic functioning (what keeps us ticking even when we are doing nothing, such as immune function and wound healing).

Mujinga Kambundji. Javianne Oliver. Barbara Pierre. They are but a sampling of the women who have brought up the rear in the 100m dash at the Prefontaine Classic in recent years. If those names are news to you, it’s probably because the TV networks tend not to go out of their way to spotlight the biggest losers.
The notable exception of course came during last Saturday’s edition of the Pre, a hotly anticipated Diamond League showcase that would mark the return of Sha’Carri Richardson from a monthlong, THC-triggered drug suspension that cost her a spot in the 2020 Olympics – and on the same Hayward Field where she stole hearts from Eugene to Yokohama after clocking a 10.86 to win the US trials. What’s more, Richardson would be going toe-to-toe with Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson – the fearsome Jamaican trio that locked out the 100m podium in Tokyo.

The Leon county circuit judge John Cooper agreed with a group of parents who claimed in a lawsuit that DeSantis’ order is unconstitutional and cannot be enforced.

                    <span>The attack on Kabul airport underlines the west’s obligations, which do not end with the occupation 
For all that it had been warned of, was perhaps even half-expected, Thursday’s terrorist attack on Kabul’s Hamid Karzai airport was a deeply shocking event. The setting for the final unravelling of the west’s failure was already frightening. Thousands of people had struggled for days to gain access to the buildings and officials that they hoped would offer them a passport to safety. With Islamic State’s attack, which began not far from the Baron Hotel where British personnel were based, and is so far known to have killed 79 civilians and 13 US service people, what had been a worst-case scenario became reality.
Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province and also as Isis-K, detonated a bomb that not only ripped apart lives, but also served as a bloodcurdling warning of what it may be capable of. Joe Biden, unsurprisingly, responded with a threat of his own: “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” he said, following the carnage, addressing the terrorists directly for the benefit of an appalled domestic audience.

                    <span>This year’s concerts have been a triumph for UK orchestras. And no jingoism necessary
The BBC Proms, the last night of which is on 11 September, are on their way to achieving the near impossible: an almost complete season, with live audiences, despite the pandemic. London’s Royal Albert Hall may have been quieter than usual, but it has still welcomed audience members who are double-vaccinated, or have tested negative, by the thousands into its expansive auditorium. In the meantime, millions have listened to the broadcasts on BBC Radio 3, or watched the concerts on iPlayer or on television.
Beneath the smooth surface, there have been many last-minute programme changes and artist swaps, as conductors and soloists booked to travel from overseas have encountered obstacles. On a number of occasions, UK-based artists have stepped in to fill the breach. In fact, the whole season, if one were so minded, might be seen as a tribute to the excellence of British orchestras, which – with the exception of the Berlin-headquartered Mahler Chamber Orchestra – have been the mainstay of this year’s season. That not only goes for the BBC orchestras, which always provide the concerts’ backbone, but also smaller, younger ensembles, such as Chineke! and the Manchester Collective.

It is a mantra heard less often these days, that the government will “follow the science” over Covid, and for good reason. As current uncertainty over the UK’s vaccine programme shows, there are times when science and politics can lead you in very different directions.
NHS England is preparing for the rollout of both third “booster” Covid vaccines and to extend vaccinations to the bulk of 12- to 15-year-olds, while the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) hopes one or both these will begin in early September.

Rather than new clothes or groceries the 60-year-old Smith had turned to the web to buy a bumblebee colony and “villa” to house them. “I decided that my garden needed bees and the bees needed a home,” he says. “They have given me a summer of pleasure and I’ll do it again next year.”

A temple complex being constructed in the north-east of Thailand has become mired in controversy, after it was claimed the design was an attempt to replicate Cambodia’s Angkor Wat, the world’s largest religious monument.
The Cambodian government reportedly plans to send archaeologists and temple architects to inspect whether the site is too similar to Angkor Wat, the national symbol depicted on the country’s flag.

Re Michael Reardon’s letter about his fears that “Lycra-clad mountain bikers” are damaging Lake District fells (Letters, 24 August), the Lake District is many things to many people. It’s home, business, a holiday destination and everything in between. It’s also inspiring, twee and exciting. It is a quiet place to reflect on life as much as it is a playground for adrenaline junkies and people exploring their personal boundaries.
Folk have a right to voice their dismay at cyclists, 4x4 drivers and even horse riders. People also have a right to complain about 15mph tourist drivers, litter louts and sheep worriers. Similarly, we all have a right to voice opposition to second-home owners, expensive pubs and poor infrastructure.

Russia’s leading independent media have appealed to Vladimir Putin and other top government officials to halt a crackdown on journalists under which some of the countries’ top outlets have been declared foreign agents or banned outright over the last year.
More than a dozen media, including Meduza, TV Rain and Novaya Gazeta have signed an open letter to the government calling on it to remove individual journalists and their outlets from its blacklists and repeal laws on “foreign agents” and “undesirable organisations” altogether.

                    <span>Regardless of where the virus came from, there’s a growing risk of another Covid-like phenomenon occurring
US intelligence services have just briefed the president, Joe Biden, on the results of their 90-day investigation into the origins of Covid-19. They were asked to test two hypotheses: that it had a “natural” origin, or that it escaped from a lab. Preliminary reports suggest that their findings are inconclusive.
Few scientists will be surprised by this, and yet the investigation has been the subject of intense – and intensely divisive – political and media interest over the past three months. The White House has promised more detail, which could be illuminating, especially if it reveals the genetic sequences of viruses related to the one that causes Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2, that were being studied in labs in Wuhan in 2019. But that won’t change the fact that two investigations down, we’re still in the dark as to how this pandemic started.

Britain’s food and drink industry is calling on the government to introduce a “Covid-19 recovery visa” to recruit overseas workers to ease disruption in the food supply chain, amid warnings from UK pig producers that healthy animals may be culled because of a labour shortage.
Trade associations representing all areas of the UK’s food chain – including the National Farmers’ Union, the Road Haulage Association, the Food and Drink Federation and the British Meat Processors Association – have sent a report to government, urging ministers to act to ensure continuity, quality and choice in Britain’s food supply.

Edith Sitwell was known for her scathing assessments of her contemporaries as much as for her poetry, famously dismissing FR Leavis a “tiresome, whining, pettifogging little pipsqueak”, and DH Lawrence as “a plaster gnome on a stone toadstool in some suburban garden”. Now her address book, which was found among family ephemera at Weston Hall in Northamptonshire, reveals her private takes on those who annoyed her, from the “impertinent Catholic ass” to the “psychopath who insulted me after television”.
Sitwell, born into a family of landed gentry, was the eldest of three siblings who all became celebrated writers. She and her brothers Osbert and Sacheverell formed a kind of literary clique that some viewed as a rival to the Bloomsbury set. Her books include The Mother and Other Poems (1915) and Façade, which were set to music by her protege William Walton.

When we’re sitting at a desk, we’re usually in a rounded position. This exercise will encourage us to do the opposite, and strengthens some of the muscles that keep us upright. It used to be part of my gymnastics training warmup as it simultaneously activates hamstrings, glutes and core in an extended position (which can be helpful for posture). Ensure you tuck your tailbone under, and squeeze your glutes to get the most from it.

                    <span>The glossy optimism of the location is a sleight of hand. Old Glasgow has been left to decay
Sailing up the Clyde was once how most travellers from abroad reached Glasgow, as well as those from Ireland, the Hebrides and the peninsulas of Argyll. Passenger liners came right up the river to within a mile of the city centre from New York and Boston and imperial cities where Scottish influence was particularly marked: Calcutta, Rangoon, Halifax, Montreal. As late as the 1960s, a traveller could step ashore in Glasgow having embarked in Dublin, Belfast or Bombay, though by that time the bigger transatlantic ships were ferrying their passengers ashore in the deeper water off Greenock, 25 miles downstream.
This trade contracted slowly in the last 50 years of the last century, and then suddenly it vanished. Other port cities have been similarly deserted, but perhaps in none of them, even New York, did the loss feel so confounding. Glasgow, after all, had seen a steamship long before it saw a steam locomotive; the first commercially successful steamboat in Europe began operating on the Clyde in 1812, beaten only to a global first (so Glasgow patriots reckoned) by the sharp practice of an American who had stolen the idea and put it to work on the Hudson. Today, the last vessel to perpetuate this two-centuries-old tradition is the elegant paddle steamer Waverley, built in 1947, which sails to and from Glasgow for two or three months every summer and whose near-miraculous survival is a testament to the love that Britain affords old machines.

                    <span>Writer and creator of the animated children’s series Roobarb, featuring an adventurous green dog and Custard the pink cat
Grange Calveley, who has died after suffering a stroke aged 78, was the creator and writer of Roobarb, the visually groundbreaking, popular cartoon series screened on British television in the early 1970s, during a golden age of children’s animation. His inspiration came when he and his wife, Hanny, moved into a new Hertfordshire home and bought a Welsh border collie. “We came to live in this lovely house with its big garden, its shed and its old conker tree,” he recalled. “Oh, and the rhubarb that grew under an old rusty bucket. That’s about when our four-legged Welsh friend moved in and the first thing he did was to water the rhubarb. And, from that moment on, we called him Roobarb.”
Calveley started drawing sketches of a dog’s adventures and kept knocking on the door of the BBC, imploring it to take up his idea, which also featured a cat called Custard, based on his neighbours’ pet. The pre-school children’s show Play School considered his stories too short for its 15-minute slot, but Calveley was persistent and finally able to sell his idea when the Australian-born director Bob Godfrey – who had already made a cartoon series featuring the Beatles and mock-erotic short films such as Kama Sutra Rides Again – suggested producing a 30-second black-and-white sample.

After the bloodshed at Kabul airport, the grim reality for those who want to prevent Islamic State’s affiliate causing further murder and mayhem in Afghanistan is that in practice their best partner for this complex and difficult battle would be the Taliban.
Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) – the name is borrowed from that used by early Islamic empires to describe much of modern Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan – was founded six years ago. Until this week it had been something of a failure. Though the group made early gains, these were rapidly lost as the Taliban fought back hard: they were not going to allow an upstart newcomer, particularly one largely composed of disaffected former Taliban commanders, Pakistanis and Uzbeks, to take over.

I am a 76-year-old married man and have had intense and ongoing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) since the age of 13.
My father was killed in the second world war, just after I was conceived. When I was six, my mother remarried; the marriage soon became unhappy and tense. My mother was a strict disciplinarian and hit me frequently when she felt I had been naughty or cheeky. She often told me off; I don’t recall her showing me much affection or praising me.

Denmark is to lift all its remaining Covid-19 restrictions by 10 September after the health ministry declared the virus “no longer a critical threat to society” because of the country’s high level of vaccination.
“The epidemic is under control, we have record vaccination levels,” the health minister, Magnus Heunicke, said in a statement on Friday. “That is why we can drop the special rules we had to introduce in the fight against Covid-19.”

A. There are relatively few measures required by the government, compared with the reopening of schools in 2020. The remaining active measures will be handwashing and hygiene, increased ventilation where possible, and in secondary schools and colleges there will be lateral flow tests for staff and pupils, with testing for staff in primary schools.

                    <span>Frank Herbert’s sprawling sci-fi saga completely defeated Alejandro Jodorowsky in the 1970s, while David Lynch hates his own compromised 1984 version. Is the third time a charm?
What kind of fool of a film-maker would proceed with part one of a major fantasy epic without first establishing that the studio backing it will stump up the cash for part two? That was the position Ralph Bakshi found himself in when his divisive 1978 animated take on JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings failed to wow critics, and it’s the one Denis Villeneuve finds himself in with regard to his forthcoming take on Frank Herbert’s space fantasy Dune, which arrives in cinemas and on the streaming service HBO on 22 October.
There is no doubt that the first big-screen take on this tale of interstellar rivalries since David Lynch’s 1984 misfire has hype in spades. Early trailers featuring Timothée Chalamet as the messianic Paul Atreides, as well as a stellar cast including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem, wowed sci-fi fans. But then, Villeneuve’s previous sci-fi spectacular, Bladerunner 2049, was similarly a fan favourite and earned rapturous reviews, yet ended up with a middling box-office take. All talk of a third movie swiftly evaporated.

Employers wake up to benefits of siesta

History is littered with famous power nappers, with Aristotle, Einstein and Winston Churchill all having embraced daytime snoozes of varying duration, while Homer’s Odyssey references polyphasic sleeping in separate chunks.
During the second world war, Churchill would nap for at least an hour in the early afternoon, writing in his war memoirs: “Nature had not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without the refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts 20 minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces.”

A three-hour break in the middle of the working day for a languorous lunch, followed by a restorative nap sounds like the Mediterranean dream, but employers in Spain are increasingly moving away from this rigid schedule, which for many workers feels more like a nightmare. 
The merits of introducing the siesta in the UK have been hotly debated this week after the National Trust unveiled plans to move towards “Mediterranean working hours” at some sites in the south-east, to help cope with rising annual temperatures.

‘Safety and wellbeing is paramount’ 
For many parents and children, the prospect of returning to school again in September should be an exciting one, but concerns are natural too. It’s something Munif Zia, principal of Hinde House academy in Sheffield has been working hard to alleviate.
Pupils can now look forward to a more “normal” return, with the easing of restrictions meaning bubbles and social distancing will no longer be mandatory – although such protective steps may be reintroduced in schools where there is a high prevalence of Covid across the whole school. Start and finish times will no longer need to be staggered, and face coverings will no longer be advised – although schools may choose to maintain some of these measures.

Loafers, blazers, argyle and rugby shirts might sound more like classic boomer wardrobe staples, but with the preppy look back in fashion they are also increasingly likely to be found on 20-somethings this autumn.
In fact, the preppy look is threatening to oust the streetwear that has dominated young people’s style for the past decade. The luxury resale site The Real Real reports that searches for the streetwear brands Vetements and Yeezy are down 24 and 25% respectively, while searches for the classic preppy brand Ralph Lauren are up by 238%. Depop, meanwhile, has recorded a 57% increase in searches for “prep” or “preppy” since June, with searches for Ralph Lauren up by 29%.

                    <span>A dark Surrey manor house gives its new American family a chilly welcome in Sean Durkin’s 80s-set ghost story cum emotional parable
Is it a ghost story? A parable of family dysfunction? Or perhaps a fever dream of neoliberalism’s troubled birth in the Thatcher-Reagan 80s and the special relationship of greed and good? Or is this rivetingly strange movie an adaptation of some 70s or 80s novel that we had somehow all forgotten about: something by Iris Murdoch, or maybe Piers Paul Read? The Nest’s director is film-maker Sean Durkin, his first since the intriguing quasi-Manson cult drama Martha Marcy May Marlene from 2011, and however much it feels like an adaptation, this is his own original screenplay – and very original.
The setting is the mid-1980s, with news about President Reagan on the radio and everyone smoking indoors, and the story begins in the handsome suburban home in upstate New York of Rory O’Hara, an expatriate Briton played by Jude Law. He has made a fortune as a commodity trader in Manhattan and one morning high-handedly tells his American wife Allison (Carrie Coon), stepdaughter Sam (Oona Roche) and young son Ben (Charlie Shotwell) that he has accepted a job offer from his old boss in the City of London. Restless, mercurial, fast-talking Rory evidently has a yen to return in triumph to his old stamping ground, and maybe cautiously reconnect with his glowering widowed mum – a terrifically potent cameo from Anne Reid.

Holed up in a town over the bridge from her adopted home of Lisbon, she spent the pandemic getting over a relationship, DJing on Soho Radio, starting a record label and teaching herself how to craft gorgeous, sun-dappled sad bangers.

                    <span>The planet-saving innovations available, and which are most likely to be used in UK houses
As we argue over heat pumps and electric car charging sockets here in the UK, it is undeniable that most of our homes have a long way to go to be eco-friendly.
To reach net zero, we are going to have to change how we heat our houses. The way they are built will probably have to change, too. Perhaps the ubiquitous squat brick suburban house will become a thing of the past. Hopefully so will our Victorian pipe system and, for those of us who rent, our ancient boilers which make a disturbing noise.

While Paris’s winding Seine has been an inspiration for some of the greatest works of romantic art and literature, the unloved Senne running through Brussels has been buried away under concrete for the last 150 years, condemned by locals as little more than a sewer and cause of disease and unhappiness.
As a constant flood risk and source of cholera, it was vaulted in, built over and hidden from sight. Now, however, Belgium’s capital is preparing to stage an inauguration ceremony that officials hope will help force a rethink among Bruxellois about their centuries-held prejudices against the waterway.

Exposure to air pollution is linked to an increased severity of mental illness, according to the most comprehensive study of its kind.
The research, involving 13,000 people in London, found that a relatively small increase in exposure to nitrogen dioxide led to a 32% increase in the risk of needing community-based treatment and an 18% increase in the risk of being admitted to hospital.

Many seeds grew to make this book. My mother reading myths to me as a child. The teacher who taught me Greek. An independent LGBTQ+ bookstore near my house in Philadelphia called Giovanni’s Room, filled with luminous, potent stories.
But if I have to name a single beginning, it was the early months of 2000. I was about to graduate with my classics degree and begin a master’s. I was already working on my thesis, on a topic that had long frustrated me: the way that some scholarship dismissed the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, labelling them “good friends”. I’d read Plato’s Symposium, where Achilles and Patroclus are not just presented as lovers, but the ideal romantic relationship. I knew that interpreting their relationship as romantic was a very old idea, and I was angry at the way homophobia was erasing this reading.

The images plastered across our screens in recent days of Afghan civilians at Hamid Karzai airport desperately trying to flee the country, as well as the bombing on Thursday, have been heartbreaking. And, for me, slightly surreal. I lived in that airport while serving as a soldier in the British army.
Watching the scenes of chaos on the tarmac, my first thought was for the civilians who worked inside the airport. I spent many afternoons after work sitting in the Afghan-owned Istanbul Cafe, a ramshackle building of several floors that overlooked the airfield, drinking the strong coffee prepared by woman and men I came to know and respect. Their journey into work every morning was 10 times as dangerous as anything I ever did in Kabul. They ran the gauntlet on bicycles while we took shelter inside armoured vehicles. I cannot help but wonder: are they safe? Did they get out?

Nicholas Shaxson is a co-founder of the Balanced Economy Project

While swathes of the economy splutter back to life, desperately attempting to survive after 18 months on life support, not everyone is struggling equally. The City of London is fire-hosing private equity firms with money, spurring them to borrow and buy up corporate Britain at a furious rate. The latest big target is Morrisons, which just agreed a $9.5bn (£6.9bn) takeover offer by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R). It’s not the first supermarket chain to have caught the attention of private equity tycoons: Asda took a big private equity investment last year from TDR Capital, alongside the Issa brothers.
But private equity’s appetite goes far beyond supermarkets. In the first half of 2021 there were 785 private equity deals in the UK with a combined value of almost £74bn, according to KPMG. Telecoms, business services, IT, veterinary services and even children’s social care have all caught the eye of investors hungry for cut-price acquisitions. “Private equity is rampant,” said Martin Sorrell, the influential advertising boss. “They are the dominant force now.”

Kysty is a restaurant in Ambleside, where the entire country and their dogs seem to be holidaying right now. This is reasonable: during an enthusiastically invasive PCR test in the back room of a Madeiran chemist earlier this month, it struck me that it might have been far easier to stay in Britain. In the Lakes, maybe, where, yes, it may well pelt with rain throughout August, but you can at least get there quickly without entering an MC Escher hellscape of contradictory pre-flight government websites.
You can also leave easily, too – after a nice scone and a look at Todd Crag – and without paying some private medical charlatan £70 for the “purchase code” for a “day two landing test”, which you post off and they sling in a hedge. We are fortunate that the British Isles are so beautiful and varied, because only the very determined are leaving on a jet plane right now. Ambleside is particularly charming, because it’s a hodge-podge of cosy cafes, country pubs, climbing walls and art galleries, as well as home to roughly 86 places where you can buy Romney’s mint cake and quick-lock anti-shock trekking poles to take home and use on Clapham Common.

Burnout is a word too often overused.
It’s more than just the September blues, that sluggish end of summer unwillingness to get back to the office. It’s not just about feeling stressed or exhausted or overwhelmed, either, but about feeling all of those things all the time, plus a gnawing sense of hopelessness on top. What’s the point of endlessly pushing boulders uphill, only for them to roll back down tomorrow? Is this really what you trained for? And at its worst, it’s compounded by what’s known as “moral injury”, or feeling forced into acting against professional and personal conscience. It’s not just about what happens in the working day, but the things that keep you awake at night.

                    <span>The party is set to become a partner to the SNP. Yet even though climate concerns are growing, it faces a raft of new challenges
Green politics in Britain has always had a problem with scale. The disparity between the damage being done to the planet and the forces mobilised against it, in electoral politics and on the streets, has so far been painfully stark.
The first British Green party (originally called the People party) was founded in the early 1970s, when anxiety about the environment was almost as widespread as it is now. Its initial election manifesto was based on A Blueprint for Survival – a bestselling book that warned of “the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet” if the economic status quo continued. Yet it took another 37 years, until 2010, for Britain to elect its first Green MP, Caroline Lucas. The representative for Brighton Pavilion still remains the only Green in the Commons.
Our electoral system’s hostility to new parties has obviously held the
Greens back. But so has the tendency of environmental emergencies to leave voters feeling overwhelmed and paralysed, or in denial. Meanwhile in protest politics, even the clarity and ingenuity of groups such as Extinction Rebellion often seem to have only a fleeting impact. When its city-centre roadblocks have been cleared away, the usual traffic and consumerism return, almost as if nothing has happened. Green politics, somehow both too big and too small to gain sustained mainstream attention, seems stuck in its niche.
But there are signs that this may finally be changing. Last week the Scottish Greens announced a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish National party. If it is accepted at a members’ meeting on Saturday, the Scottish Greens will become the first British Green party to enter government.

This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from earlier in the year. This episode was first broadcast on 21 January.
Rachel Humphreys talks to the Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman about the television show Sex and the City. Last week the US streaming service HBO Max announced that the series will be returning under a new title, And Just Like That, and will feature the original stars apart from Kim Cattrall. Hadley tells Rachel why she thinks the original show was such a huge success – offering a potent mix of escapism with serious, well-written plot lines that she feels sing with “emotional truth”. Hadley notes that SATC is often singled out for criticism over its lack of diversity while other shows of that era such as the HBO series The Sopranos do not invite the same level of criticism.

A woman told a New York court on Thursday of a relationship she had with R Kelly in which he would film their sexual interactions and yell at her for disobeying his commands.

An intense surge in Covid cases is pushing Oregon’s healthcare system to the brink as mostly unvaccinated patients fill up hospitals and nearly all available ICU beds in the state are occupied.
Oregon has more people hospitalized than at any other point in the pandemic, which officials attribute to the hyper-contagious Delta variant and low vaccination rates in some regions. The state’s governor has dispatched about 1,500 national guard troops to hospitals in the state and reinstated a mask mandate.

Romelu Lukaku’s first eight league games against Liverpool, when he was a much rawer prospect, yielded five goals, with Daniel Agger, Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho among those buffeted relentlessly and remorselessly by his bulldozing presence. Yet he failed to score in his subsequent seven against the Reds and it’s eight and a half years since his only goal at Anfield – a fine effort for West Brom while on loan during his first time under Chelsea’s umbrella. Thomas Tuchel is the man delighted to be holding the handle this time around, however, though Virgil van Dijk offers as stern a challenge as can be provided when it comes to strutting your “I’m the finished article” stuff. Chelsea won the equivalent fixture in March, resigning Liverpool to their worst ever run of home losses, but with Jürgen Klopp’s side in better nick now, will the Belgian prove the difference between two well-matched sides?

Coronavirus – latest updates
BBC presenter Lisa Shaw died of Covid vaccine complications, coroner finds

The chances of developing dangerous blood clots after being infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 far outweighs the risks of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, according to the largest study of its kind.
The sweeping analysis used data from more than 29 million people in England to compare both vaccines with infection from Sars-Cov-2. It weighed up rates of hospital admission or death from blood clots, as well as other blood disorders, within 28 days of either a positive test or receiving the first jab.

Multiple bomb blasts and at least one attack by a gunman in Kabul on Thursday killed dozens of civilians and at least 13 US service personnel, and plunged the evacuation of western forces from Afghanistan into deeper crisis.
The US death toll rose from 12 to 13 and was likely to rise even higher, a US official told Reuters. More than a dozen were wounded.

 Ministers and unions fear that Liberty Steel faces a “cliff edge”, risking thousands of jobs when the UK’s furlough scheme ends next month, unless owner Sanjeev Gupta can secure a new source of financing after months of delays.
Gupta’s loose conglomerate, GFG Alliance, has been urgently seeking new lenders to plug a black hole after the collapse of Greensill Capital, its key lender, in March. GFG faces a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation into those financing arrangements.

Manchester City are hoping to pull off a sensational attempt to sign Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portugal forward’s representative held talks with Juventus over a potential return to the Premier League.
The 36-year-old has less than 12 months left of his deal with the Italian club that is worth an estimated €31m a season after tax, having moved to Serie A from Real Madrid in 2018. Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, was in Turin on Wednesday to discuss the former Manchester United forward’s future after weeks of speculation, with Juventus understood to want a fee of between €25 and €30m.

Gareth Southgate has revealed that he received more abuse for recording a video urging young people to have a Covid-19 vaccination than he did for his management of England during their run to the final of Euro 2020.
England’s manager, who handed Leeds United’s Patrick Bamford his first call-up when he named his squad for next month’s World Cup qualifiers against Hungary, Poland and Andorra, admitted he is worried about misinformation on social media convincing some footballers not to have the jab.

Real Madrid are waiting to see whether Paris Saint-Germain will accept their new offer of €170m (£146m) for Kylian Mbappé as the Spanish giants step up their pursuit of the France forward.
Having seen their initial bid of €160m rejected this week after the PSG sporting director, Leonardo, said the offer was “not sufficient”, Madrid have returned with what they see as their final offer for a player whose contract expires at the end of this season.

Just about any documentary set in a school, among the scramble of children bulging this way and that and the tensile network of teachers arching protectively over them, is emotionally exhausting. If you have the slightest bit of imagination, empathy or compassion – the slightest bit of sentience, really – you cannot fail to sit back at the end of every one, exhale deeply and exclaim: “I don’t know how they do it.”
Add Covid and a focus on the GCSE years to that little lot – as Sixteen: Class of 2021 (Channel 4) does – and you can expect to be pulverised. This is the first of a series of four films in which we follow the year 11s of the Link Academy in Dudley, in the West Midlands, as they return to school in September 2020, after the first lockdown. The previous year group had their exams scrapped, and grades given on the basis of mock results. As such, we learn that the year 11 mocks have been brought forward, in an attempt to mitigate disaster in the event of another lockdown.

Kane makes first start of season after agreeing to stay

Harry Kane showed his renewed commitment to his club’s cause by scoring twice on his first start of the season. Passage to the group stages of the Europa Conference League, which Giovani Lo Celso secured by claiming a third goal, may not be the summit of Spurs’ ambitions but Kane’s role in a rousing team performance lifted the mood music around Tottenham.
A day after pledging his immediate future to Spurs, and perhaps while still trying to block out envious thoughts about the draw for the group stages of the Champions League, Kane made his first start of the season – in Europe’s third-tier club competition.

Group A is by by some distance the toughest, featuring the defeated finalist of the past two seasons, plus RB Leipzig, who reached the semi-final two seasons ago. There will be a repeat of last season’s semi-final, in which Manchester City comfortably overcame Paris Saint-Germain in a battle of two mega-rich petro-clubs. City’s problem tends to come later in the competition as Pep Guardiola overthinks a major tie, but for once progress will not be straightforward against a PSG now bolstered by Lionel Messi and, perhaps more consequentially, Achraf Hakimi, Sergio Ramos and Gini Wijnaldum. Leipzig may not quite be so strong this season, in transition after Jesse Marsch replaced Julian Nagelsmann as coach, while Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahmim Konaté have left. Club Brugge have never made it through the group stage.

Another long, hot afternoon in Kabul was drawing to a close. Thousands of foreigners and Afghans – many in family groups with young children – still hoping to flee the capital, thronged the heavily guarded gates of Hamid Karzai international airport, desperate to board one of the last planes out.
The atmosphere was febrile: hours earlier, shots were fired to disperse an angry crowd as an Italian military transport plane carrying nearly 100 Afghan civilians took off, one of hundreds of foreign and private evacuation flights over the past 12 days.

                    <span>The sum is 10 times the average loan, and was paid to a company indirectly controlled by Matt Moulding
Warrington council lent the billionaire owner of The Hut Group (THG) £151m after the online retailer’s £5bn market listing.
The Cheshire local authority extended a £200m loan facility to a company controlled by Matt Moulding in October, one of the largest council loans on record, from which it has taken three drawdowns totalling more than £151m.

Andy Murray may be hoping to build some rhythm and establish a run of matches at the US Open this year, but he will start with one of the toughest first-round draws possible as he faces Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece.
The pair have never faced each other. Tsitsipas, seeded third and beaten in the French Open final in June by Novak Djokovic, is part of the second tier of tournament favourites, behind the Serb.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Confusion is growing over whether all children aged 12 and over will soon be offered a Covid jab as schools in England prepare to return next week, with the NHS gearing up for vaccinations but government scientists warning of potential complications.
Amid uncertainty over the parallel issue of who may be given a third, “booster”, jab the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is understood to have concerns on issues including knock-on effects on other childhood vaccinations, and the logistics of a mass programme for 12- to 15-year-olds.

The officers accused them of intentionally sending a violent mob to disrupt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the November 2020 election.

                    <span>Unite’s general secretary is more interested in the industrial struggle than the political one. For workers, that could be a blessing
The surprise election of Sharon Graham to head Britain’s biggest trade union, Unite, is more about the labour movement than the Labour party. Her victory represents a desire to make organised labour matter rather than let it sleepwalk into irrelevance. Ms Graham’s rise through Unite has been marked both by her attention to policy detail and a willingness to mobilise the power of workers to secure better terms and conditions. With a base in the union’s shop stewards, her arrival in the top job represents the triumph of workplace concerns over a leadership style that prioritised political positioning.
Unlike her defeated male rivals, Unite’s new general secretary is not beholden to any section of the bureaucracy. Over the past 40 years, this union machine has sent officials to negotiate with bosses from a position of weakness. Unite’s bark has been worse than its bite. Ms Graham’s pitch was that she wanted to force change in the workplace, not have change forced on workers. A leftwinger, her manifesto is open about Unite exercising its strike muscle to deter bullying employers.

                    <span>It is no surprise that anxiety is increasing, nor that it is distributed unequally. More money for mental health services is needed
It is 10 years since the UK government began to measure happiness. As part of its annual population survey, the official statistics body now asks interviewees questions about their satisfaction, mood and sense of life being “worthwhile”. Not surprisingly, given present circumstances, the news at the moment is not good. While there isn’t a full decade’s worth of data yet, the most recent findings were on the gloomy side: measures of personal wellbeing significantly worsened in 2020, while anxiety reached record highs.
In a pandemic, what would you expect? Not joy, for sure. But Covid is far from the only shadow looming over us. The climate emergency and declining living standards are the most obvious reasons for pessimism. Many younger people, in particular, are filled with fears about a future that older people may never see, while millions face an increasingly difficult struggle to secure the basics of life (housing, food, health). Citizens Advice has warned that the upcoming £20 a week cut to universal credit could drive 2.3 million people into debt.

Afghanistan – live updates

A last-ditch attempt to evacuate all the British embassy guards on one of the final flights out of Afghanistan has failed, leaving them increasingly frightened about their future.
The international security company GardaWorld, which employed about 200 Afghan staff on contracts to protect the British embassy in Kabul, arranged 10 buses to collect their former employees to take them to the airport before dawn on Thursday.

A vast patch of warming water off the coast of New Zealand – referred to as a “warming blob” – has contributed to a decade long drought affecting parts of South America, according to scientists.
Researchers based in New Zealand and Chile have examined the rapidly warming hot blob which rose to prominence in 2019 after spikes in water temperature of up to 6C were recorded.

The Scottish government hopes the package of support material, released on Thursday, would “embed anti-racism and race equality into all aspects of school life” – and includes new guidance from Education Scotland on normalising diversity within the curriculum.

Andy Beckett’s call for Labour to practise “clear-sighted, ruthless politics” (Johnson’s Tories seem to defy reality – but Labour’s ‘realistic’ politics isn’t working, 20 August) could gain traction if it asked what the Conservative party’s worst nightmare might be. Time and time again it has won general elections by appealing to voters with confected nightmare warnings along the lines of “don’t let Labour ruin things”.
Simply reminding voters that Boris Johnson’s administration has been more effective in ruining the country than any other in living memory will not cut it. Neither, it seems, will the charge of incompetence. Somehow the Labour party (and for that matter other non-Conservative parties) must force a change in the terms of debate at a general election.

Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates are pressing Joe Biden to take new steps to end an immigration policy begun by his predecessor, Donald Trump, after the US supreme court ordered that the controversial “Remain in Mexico” program be reinstated.
The policy put in place by Trump, forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await US hearings, instead of being allowed to cross the US-Mexico border and follow their legal process, which can take years to play out, on American soil.

                    <span>Following in Beyoncé’s footsteps, the singer’s new short film suggests that a clothing concept that originated with Princess Diana is no longer relevant
Has the pandemic killed off the “revenge dress”? This week, Kacey Musgraves teased her new album and short film Star-Crossed. The releases come after her divorce and there are deep echoes of Beyoncé’s Lemonade. Billed as a “tragedy told in three acts”, the film uses fashion to tell her breakup story, but there is no “revenge dress” look.
Instead, we saw Musgraves in a number of outfits that seemingly semaphore a mix of tragedy and catharsis. There’s a wedding dress that is worn subversively with some extra high heels and bejewelled eyebrows. There’s a smattering of red tulle, a balaclava and some angel wings. A closeup image of a corset with a tiny sword through it was posted to her Instagram page after the teaser dropped.

Thitisan Utthanaphon, 39, who has been removed from his position as superintendent of Muang police station in Nakhon Sawan, north of Bangkok, is accused of trying to extract 2m baht (£44,463) from the suspect. He disappeared days before a video of the incident went viral on social media, but was detained by police on Thursday.

Afsana Hamidy, 26, arrived at Birmingham airport on Wednesday, and will be studying a master’s in inclusive education at Roehampton University in London. “I have worked for almost two years to get this scholarship. This is the only thing that has given me hope for the future,” she said. “But I’m not sure how my studies will go with the mental situation that I have right now.

                    <span>North Cornwall town reeling and people urged not to visit as thousands of cases linked to festival
At first glance it looked like a pretty perfect day in the self-styled surfing capital of the UK. The sandy beaches were packed, the pubs, cafes and shops humming.
Look at little closer, though, and it became clear all was not quite right. A tapas bar was closed because a team member had tested positive; a surf shop shut its doors at lunchtime because of staff shortages; a scribbled note stuck on the window of a fudge shop summed up the problem – “Covid in Newquay is on the increase” – and urged customers to wear a mask and socially distance.

Afghanistan – live updates

The UK defence secretary has accused supporters of a former British marine attempting to evacuate his shelter animals and staff from Kabul of trying to interfere with the rescue attempt of desperate Afghans.
Ben Wallace hit out at the “bullying, falsehoods and threatening behaviour” by those backing Paul “Pen” Farthing, who founded the charity Nowzad and has made a dash for the airport along with his 25 Afghan staff, their families and 173 rescued animals.

“Bad bosses take note.” That was the message of the new general secretary of the Unite trade union, Labour’s largest affiliate. Sharon Graham has stated her priority in very clear terms: putting Unite members and workplaces first. She has become the first woman to lead Unite – meaning that it and Unison, the two largest unions in the country, as well as the TUC itself, are now led by women.
Discussion of Graham’s insurgent victory inevitably turns to what this will mean for Labour. As it was founded by trade unionists, that is inevitable. Yet in many ways it does a disservice to trade unions that we talk about them so much through the prism of the Labour party.

The unprecedented demand for puppies during the pandemic has had serious consequences for animal health and welfare, a study has revealed.
Researchers at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) looked into the impact of the last 16 months on puppy purchasing amid concerns that a huge puppy welfare crisis was unfolding in the UK. They found that while many people who bought dogs during Covid did so with the best intentions, the extreme rise in demand has heightened the risk of puppies being sourced from poor welfare environments, bred or raised on puppy farms, or illegally imported.

Just after I started high school, there was the Cuban missile crisis, so I wasn’t sure if the world was going to be around much longer. It was a very intense, frightening 13 days, then suddenly it was over and I got into the more mundane problems of being a teenager. I wanted to act, was in plays at school and would read the plays of Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee. The weirder the better. I didn’t have an outlet for music then. I’d hated piano lessons. I listened to the usual teenage fare like Frankie Avalon or Bobby Rydell, but the folk music explosion changed everything. My older brother owned a record player and would play old-time country and bluegrass. Nothing did anything for me except Johnny Cash’s first record, Johnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar! Then suddenly there was Peter, Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Buffy Sainte-Marie. I cherished Dick Cerri’s radio show Music Americana, the Folk Music of America. Every night, he’d play the new folk artists I was just becoming aware of and I would sit on my little bedroom floor doing my homework, listening in awe.

As the Taliban started searching their neighbourhood, Abdul and his wife began to hide with different relatives across Kabul. One night they narrowly escaped, fleeing through a back door. Abdul is still carrying the job records and ID documents that could be their only ticket out. But if the Taliban find them first, those same papers could prove a death sentence.
Talking yesterday via a patchy WhatsApp connection, Abdul told me how he’s been on the run on and off ever since 2012, when he last worked as an interpreter for the British army in Helmand. His was the most dangerous, visible job: scanning locations for traps and other dangers before heavily armoured British troops moved in. Eventually, after threats from distant Taliban relatives, he fled.

                    <span>As well as rebooting the horror classic, the 31-year-old is directing a Marvel movie with a $100m-plus budget. She talks about ambition, superstition – and whether she’s risked saying ‘Candyman’ five times
“Say it,” implore the posters for the new Candyman sequel, referring to the urban myth that the hook-handed ghost of the title can be summoned by repeating his name five times in front of a mirror. But Nia DaCosta will not say it: “Oh hell, no.” She is shaking her head. “Never have done, never will.” Despite having written and co-directed the film, DaCosta isn’t taking any chances. “In fact, when I was watching auditions, I would get a little freaked out so I’d stop the audition before they said it all five times. So silly,” she admits, laughing at herself. But she is not superstitious, she insists. “It’s just that one bit. Nothing [else] about it scares me at this point. Except … I’m just not gonna put myself in the space for my brain to play tricks on me.”

                    <span>Lee Pearson triumphed in the Paralympic dressage to claim his 12th gold, and followed it with a heartfelt plea
“Love has to prevail, really. Whatever shape or form, I think love has to prevail. If you’re born with a disability, if you have a child with a disability, if you’re born with same-sex attraction, if your daughter comes out or your son, then just love them. Nobody wants to be different but we have to embrace different people because that’s society, that’s the world. Those different people they’re not going anywhere. So you can say it’s illegal, you can make them feel awful, but somewhere in the world another gay boy or girl will be born. Somewhere in the world someone will be born with no limbs. Do you know what I mean? Life goes on and it’s silly in this day and age when we have countries that are still in the stone age, as we say, 100 years behind. But I’m just a horse rider. Promise.”
Some horse rider. On Thursday Sir Lee Pearson scored a comprehensive triumph in the Grade II individual test in dressage, to win the 12th Paralympic gold medal of his career. He did so on the back of a new partner, Breezer (son of Bacardi), and ahead of his great Austrian rival, Pepo Puch. In the stifling heat of the Tokyo afternoon, with the weather warning dropping just below the level local organisers term a “danger”, Pearson and Breezer, well, breezed home.

Britain’s economic recovery from the winter lockdown is showing signs of stalling amid shortages of workers and supplies due to the double whammy of Covid and Brexit, according to a Guardian analysis.
Despite the easing of most government pandemic restrictions, consumer caution appears to have crept higher in the past month as the Delta variant fuels a persistently high infection rate. In the meantime, UK businesses have come under pressure from global supply chain disruption and staff shortages.

                    <span>Longer breaks could mitigate some effects of extreme weather due to the climate crisis
I will confess that my sleepy heart sang when I read the news that the National Trust would be introducing siestas for its staff. My people, I thought. A French friend of mine notes that Britain is one of the only countries where it is acceptable to withdraw socially for “a lie down” simply because you’re tired of company, but the working day, in its punishing Protestantism, is a different matter. Part of my dislike of offices, aside from them being the enemy of creativity for anyone who needs peace in which to work, is that there are never enough places to nap.
Naturally, I’ll be met with accusations of laziness for even saying this. We are in the middle of a tedious and strung-out debate about work and flexibility, and a disturbing number of people seem to have Stockholm syndrome. Only yesterday I read a piece in Fortune magazine entitled: “Want to work 9-to-5? Good luck building a career”. The concept of work/life balance has “become emblematic of a woke work environment – one that acknowledges that an employee base is composed of actual humans, often with spouses, children and outside interests”, said the writer. God forbid!

Campaigners have hailed a new agreement designed to protect garment workers in Bangladesh, signed by the likes of H&amp;M and Inditex, which owns Zara and Bershka.
The accord replaces another agreement signed by more than 200 international fashion companies after the Rana Plaza factory fire in 2013, in which more than 1,100 people died. For the first time, these companies faced legal action if their health and safety standards were found lacking or if they did not address problems in an agreed time period. More than 38,000 inspections have been carried out since 2013, and nearly 200 factories have lost their contracts owing to poor safety standards.

Devastating floods across Europe, killer heatwaves in Canada, wildfires across the US. Extreme weather has hit the headlines across the world in the past few weeks, and even climate scientists have been shocked by its severity and extent, which they say is clearly linked to human activity in heating the planet.
It all comes as no surprise to Paul Brown, the Guardian’s former environment correspondent. He was warning of the consequences of climate change nearly four decades ago, from the mid-1980s, as scientists began to raise the alarm over greenhouse gas emissions and their potential impact.

The movie might be flawed, but Driver’s performance (playing opposite the similarly excellent Alba Rohrwacher) is outstanding, winning him the Volpi Cup at the Venice film festival. He plays Jude, a young man who meets his future wife Mina (Rohrwacher) in New York when they are bizarrely locked in a restaurant toilet together. They marry, have a baby and at first everything is wonderful – but then she begins to show symptoms of postpartum psychosis and Jude has an agonising dilemma: if and when to take the baby away from her. Driver plays it with overwhelming sincerity and force.

                    <span>Courses on public land could be used ‘in a more creative way’ to ease housing crisis and provide accessible green space
London’s golf courses make up an area larger than the borough of Brent and there is enough space on publicly owned courses to house 300,000 people, according to new research.
Nearly half of the capital’s 94 active golf courses are owned by London boroughs or other public bodies, such as the Church Commissioners, and yet serve a tiny fraction of the capital’s 9 million residents.

Aaron Dessner and Justin ‘Bon Iver’ Vernon recruit Taylor Swift, Fleet Foxes and more for this album full of misty autumnal beauty – and a quiet punch
Aaron Dessner cuts a very low-profile figure, even by the standards of both bookish US alt-rockers and blue-chip pop collaborators, neither of whom require otherworldly charisma or an outrageous image. Put it this way: the New York Times recently ran a lengthy profile piece, lauding his achievements – his work on Taylor Swift’s multi-platinum, Grammy-winning 2020 album Folklore; its follow-up Evermore and her ongoing project to re-record her entire back catalogue; the National’s 20 year career, including their own Grammy for 2017’s Sleep Well Beast; his collaboration with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon as Big Red Machine – and illustrated it with a photo not of Dessner, but his brother Bryce. An easy mistake to make – the Dessner brothers are twins – but nevertheless.
Dessner, though, seems happy with quiet anonymity. He had to be coaxed from the background to add three lead vocals to Big Red Machine’s second album, and would doubtless balk at the notion of this collective being a supergroup, although that’s precisely the label How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last? would have earned them in a previous era. As well as Dessner and Vernon, the album variously features Swift, Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold, Sharon Van Etten, This Is the Kit, Anaïs Mitchell – the singer-songwriter whose 2010 album Hadestown begat the multiple Tony-winning Broadway musical of the same name – Ben Howard, Lisa Hannigan, My Brightest Diamond’s Shara Nova, and Naeem Juwan, the rapper formerly known as Spank Rock.

Cliff camping seemed like a great idea during the pandemic, when we were craving adventure. After a couple of hours spotting seals, abseiling and rock climbing with our very patient guide, we abseiled down to our bed for the night, and spent the next seven hours lying on a portable ledge above the crashing waves. I spent the night going from laughter to fear. There were some moments of calm however, and we even spotted a few shooting stars. It was the most unique place I’ve ever slept, and not a night I will ever forget. Hannah Mitchell, charity worker, West Midlands

The realities of climate change are front-page news every day. Temperature records are being smashed. Wildfires are raging. There is no sign of things going back to “normal”. If anything, they will only get worse.
Last year, when the planet was convulsing with the arrival of a pandemic, we pinned our hopes on technology – in the form of an mRNA vaccine – getting us out of our crisis. The vaccine was a technological intervention, injected into the arms of billions of people. Could we (should we?) look to technological solutions to our climate crisis, too?

It is a crisp, sunny day – the kind that brings tourists to Montauk, a small fishing village at the end of Long Island, New York. Although the town is better-known as a resort destination, it is the state’s largest commercial fishing port, only one of two major ports that are still in operation.

                    <span>The 2010 earthquake response was riddled with failure. Haitians cannot afford another catastrophe
The latest statistics from Haiti’s August 14 earthquake are stark: at least 2,207 people have been confirmed dead and more than 12,000 injured. More than 130,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks continue, and new landslides in the wake of the follow-on Tropical Storm Grace mean those numbers are expected to rise in the coming weeks.
But the most dispiriting number is 11. That is the number of years that passed between Haiti’s last major earthquake and this one – years in which corruption has hollowed out the state, armed gangs have expanded their territorial control, and political turmoil has intensified, culminating in the assassination of the president, Jovenel Moïse, in July.

The north of the island of Lanzarote is a hidden idyll where sunsets burn golden orange and surf pounds the wild shores. Famara Beach is a surfing paradise for families looking for winter sun and a relaxed beach community. Staying in a yurt in nearby Arrieta is fantastic: at night you can watch the stars from your bed as you gently drift asleep listening to the waves. La Graciosa is a 20-minute boat ride away and hosts two tiny but perfect beachside restaurants serving freshly caught sardines. Spanish fills the air and British voices are rare. The mountains here are home to huge agave plants, aloes, bougainvillaea, date palms and pepper trees.

                    <span>Fight to save fish tells story of how European food preferences clashed with tribal systems, shaping what we choose to protect
Perry Chocktoot remembers the last time he ate a C’waam suckerfish. It was 1984. The fish was canned by a Klamath Tribes member and served with Tabasco. After finishing off the meat, Chocktoot was left with a tin of smoky fish oil mixed with hot sauce. “We just tipped it back and drank it,” Chocktoot recalled. “It was so good.”
Just four years later, the C’waam and its cousin the Koptu were put on the endangered species list. Since then, for more than three decades, no member of the Klamath Tribes has legally harvested the species, which are endemic to a lake and series of rivers in southern Oregon known as the Klamath Basin and once formed the backbone to the tribes’ seasonal food system.

We are as far away from 1980 now as we were then from 1939. I know that because I read it on the internet. I didn’t check it, because why would they put it there if it wasn’t true? Yet at the same time, it is patently absurd; more than ridiculous, mad. In 1980, the late 30s were pure history, and all we could remember about the humans in them was the way they crowded around radios and drank cocktails containing tiny pickled onions. The early 80s, by contrast, were effectively yesterday, and we can all remember them with pin-sharp clarity.
At least, I can: the evidence keeps reminding me that young people can’t remember the era at all.

If you were to drive through Medford, a small city in southern Oregon, you’d pass by an unremarkable motel. You’d see guests sitting out on their balconies, smoking cigarettes, walking their dogs across the small patch of lawn, and watching the kids laugh and play in the pool.
But these people aren’t typical hotel guests. They are 159 fire refugees, displaced after losing their homes during one of the worst fire seasons the west coast has ever experienced. As the climate crisis causes higher-than-normal temperatures, dry conditions and strong winds, Oregon and California are facing more intense blazes than ever before. This new breed of fires is destroying entire communities – the 8 September 2020 conflagration known as the Almeda fire, for instance, decimated two towns in southern Oregon, torched 2,700 houses and displaced 3,000 people.

Food manufacturers have called on ministers to alleviate labour shortages by allowing them to employ prisoners. This comes as other firms, from hauliers to supermarkets, are also finding themselves short of workers for reasons relating to Brexit and the pandemic. Prisoners could indeed help out, if they are given the opportunity to do real work for a real wage – but a lot would need to change to make this happen, not least the prisons.
Very few prisoners have the opportunity to do real work, and many would jump at the chance to get out of their cells and do something useful and social that would give them money to support their families and buy little luxuries like soap, some extra food and even enrol in education programmes.

Hong Kong’s national security police are investigating the organisers of a vigil commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre for alleged foreign collusion offences.
Chow Hang-tung, the vice-chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, said authorities had written to core members of the longstanding group demanding information related to their foreign links within 14 days.

                    <span>Surveys suggest a large proportion of women have experienced sexual assaults that they labelled as a misunderstanding. This has serious psychological repercussions and increases the chance of being victimised again
The morning after it happened, I said a cheery: “Good morning,” to my university roommate, as if nothing was wrong. “How was last night?” she asked. “So fun,” I lied. The truth was that the night before I had feared for my life.
I didn’t articulate it, but deep down I knew that what had happened had felt violating, degrading and not what I signed up for. Yet it took me a whole decade to realise what had really happened: I had been sexually assaulted.

Greek officials have said that Greece will not become a “gateway” to Europe for Afghan asylum seekers and have called for a united response to predictions of an increase in refugee arrivals to the country.
Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has spoken to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about the developing situation in Afghanistan this week. Greek migration minister Notis Mitarachi last week said: “We cannot have millions of people leaving Afghanistan and coming to the European Union … and certainly not through Greece.” The country has just completed a 25-mile (40km) wall along its land border with Turkey and installed an automated surveillance system with cameras, radars and drones.

                    <span>Following two anglers into an area of deep forests and swift rivers brings a new appreciation of the mindful appeal of fly-fishing
I first learned about fly-fishing in a story by Truman Capote called Handcarved Coffins. In America’s midwest, Capote’s help is solicited by a small-town sheriff stumped by a string of diabolically ingenious murders in his remote farming community. The victims have been killed in ways suggesting intimate knowledge of their habits, yet nowhere is there any apparent motive. In the end Capote has no evidence but meets up with the man he reasons must be the killer. He’s fly-fishing. Waist-high in a stream, he talks about the “will of God”. As little as I then knew about the sport, it somehow made perfect sense that the killer would be fly-fishing.
In a larger sense, fly-fishing is a discipline of the mind, about things unseen. In the run-up to my trip to Sweden’s fly-fishing mecca Älvdalen, four hours north of Stockholm, I listened to fly-fishing stories on the internet. Many are about technique, or about making the “flies,” the tiny lures fly-fishers use; also, oddly, there are a great many tales about fly-fishing as a sort of personal, even spiritual, quest, about people who go to restore a relationship, to help them unravel some knotty issue in their lives or just find peace of mind. Somehow fly-fishing makes that possible.

                    <span>She’s the queen of the power ballad mega hit – and has even written songs for Biden, Harris and Ringo Starr. Now the world’s most successful female songwriter is finally releasing her own album
At the end of the 1990s, when Diane Warren was the unrivalled queen of the power ballad, her music publisher presented her with a quartet of gold discs and a plaque hailing her as “the career saviour of the 90s”. The discs celebrated the windswept mega-hits Warren had written for Toni Braxton (Un-Break My Heart), LeAnn Rimes (How Do I Live), Celine Dion (Because You Loved Me) and Aerosmith (I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing), the first two of which are still among the bestselling US singles ever.
To be imperial in one pop era is usually to be defined by it for evermore, but Warren has been writing hits for almost four decades, notching up nine US No 1s and 32 Top 10 hits. In 2015, Til It Happens to You, her potent Lady Gaga collaboration for a documentary about campus rape, made her once again the pop equivalent of the striker you turn to when you absolutely have to score a penalty.

                    <span>The families of some 9/11 victims are still pursuing compensation from those complicit in the attacks – but is Sudan, already ravaged by years of US sanctions, really the right target?
Five months after the terrorist strikes by al-Qaida on 11 September 2001, a lawyer named Ron Motley received a phone call from Deena Burnett, whose husband had been killed in the attack. Thomas Burnett, she explained, had been on one of the hijacked planes. She wanted to ask whether he would help her to find a way to sue those responsible for the attack that claimed her husband.
Two weeks after the call, on 2 March 2002, Motley and a team of lawyers with his firm, Motley Rice, spent a day with the Burnett family at their home in California. They described how, upon realising the plane had been taken over for a suicide mission, Thomas Burnett had led the charge on the cockpit on flight 93. He and his fellow passengers managed to divert the plane from its target – the White House. The cockpit flight recorder captured his now-famous last words before they stormed the hijackers: “We’re going in!” Shortly after, the plane crashed, killing all 44 people on board. Burnett was 38 years old.

                    <span>It can feel as if our options narrow with every passing year. But taking a big risk could mean the second half of your life is much more exciting and fulfilling than the first
Alison Webster was once showing prospective students around the university where she was studying medicine when a sixth former said: “You’re so old – why are you even doing this?” Webster laughs at the memory, home after the end of a shift as an A&amp;E doctor. “I said, ‘When you go home, ask your mum if she likes her life. I bet there’s something your mum’s always wanted to do that she’s not had the opportunity to do because of you. Ask what her dreams were, and see if she has fulfilled them.’”
Webster’s childhood dream was to be a doctor, but she didn’t do well in her A-levels, “so that got put to one side. But it was always in there.” She ran a music distribution company, but as she approached her 40s, the business was struggling and she had started to wonder what to do with the rest of her life. Was a career in medicine really out of reach?

Afghanistan withdrawal – live updates

It is a treacherous journey of thousands of miles that crosses arid deserts, steep mountains, rivers, armed checkpoints, barbed wire and metres-high concrete walls. But for the Afghans fleeing the Taliban, this inhospitable route – traversing Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and into the Balkans – is the pathway, they believe, to freedom.
After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban this month, following weeks of rapid successive victories across the country, the instinct of many Afghans has been to escape by any means possible.

                    <span>After 21 competitors died during a 100km mountain race in Gansu province earlier this year, the Chinese government suspended all extreme sports. But those who love ultrarunning insist it can be safe – and has changed how they see the world. What keeps them coming back?
This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from the year so far. This episode was first broadcast on 8 June.
To most people, the horror of 21 lives being lost during a race across 100km in a Chinese mountain range will have been amplified by how obscure the sport seems to outsiders. But ultrarunning has boomed in popularity in recent years, with the number of finishers around the world rising from 120,000 to more than 600,000 in a decade. Now there are concerns that in China and beyond, a proliferation of new races has created a risk that safety rules will not always be enforced, and with it a chance that some of the most obsessive participants will discard vital protective equipment in the interests of gaining an advantage over their rivals.

The desperate remained outside, some standing knee-deep in sewage and waving identity documents at Western soldiers in hopes of being allowed to go beyond the barbed wire fencing and onto a flight out.
While the final withdrawal date just under a week away, analyst Patricia Lewis said the practical deadline for the evacuations to stop was ‘the next couple of days.’

A Covid-19 modeller has suggested New Zealand’s North and South islands could become separate bubbles as the country grapples with a coronavirus outbreak, although South islanders with hopes of being fully released from lockdown should not hold their breath just yet.
New Zealand is battling to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant that swiftly led to a nationwide, level four lockdown – the highest setting – which has been extended until at least the end of the week. There are now 210 cases in the community.

Signs of life beyond our solar system may be detectable within two to three years, experts have said after rethinking the kinds of planets that may be habitable.
Researchers have mostly looked for planets of a similar size, mass, temperature and atmospheric composition to Earth. But University of Cambridge astronomers believe there may be more promising possibilities after recent work suggested that a “mini-Neptune” more than twice the radius of Earth and more than eight times as massive may also be habitable.

UK carmakers made 53,400 vehicles in July, a 37.6% drop when compared with the same month in 2020, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry’s lobby group.

None of us realised how good we had it in 2007, in our pre-Trump, pre-Brexit, pre-Covid bubble. We even had a Labour government, for chrissakes.
And we had Gossip Girl, a perfect confection of madness, the bubbles at the brim of our overfilled cup of complacency. It followed a group of uber-rich Upper East Side New York high schoolers who had names as excellent as their lives. Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester – yes, the actors had equally unbelievable names) was the queen bee, while her best friend/frenemy was Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively – see!). The permutations of their relationships with Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick), Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford, whose jawline should have got separate billing), poverty-stricken Dan and Jenny Humphreys (Penn Badgley and Taylor Momsen, who lived in a loft apartment in – ugh – Brooklyn) and Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr) formed the mainstay of the show. There were also the times Blair became the princess of Monaco and Elizabeth Hurley played Nate’s boss and girlfriend so badly for 14 episodes that it is spoken of only in hushed whispers on the darknet.

Ty Garbin admitted his role in the alleged scheme weeks after his arrest last fall. He is among six men charged in federal court but the only one to plead guilty so far. It was an important victory for prosecutors as they try to prove the other five men were involved in the astonishing plot.

Wigan on the brink of dropping out of Super League’s play-offs

Sometimes, the statistics speak entirely for themselves. Wigan Warriors are one of rugby league’s most famous and successful clubs but there is no doubting that at present this proud sporting institution are simply not at the races – and they are now on the brink of dropping out of Super League’s play-off places altogether.
For the first time since 1991, Wigan have failed to score at home. They have gone over 200 minutes without scoring a try. The Warriors have not failed to score a try at home in consecutive games for almost 60 years, dating back to 1965. Given the lofty standards Wigan have created for themselves throughout rugby league history, those numbers scream more about their current plight than this result or performance ever could.

                    <span>If it was an indignity for Arsenal to enter the Carabao Cup at this early stage because of their absence from European competition, they booked their passage to the next round by showing true class. Against a Championship club’s reserves, admittedly, but this was a demonstration from which Mikel Arteta and his team can take heart.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his first start of the season, and Nicolas Pépé, Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette also netted in a match in which the visitors threatened to score nearly every time they attacked. Now all they have to do is play like this regularly against stronger opponents. Then trust will grow in Arsenal’s players and Arteta’s process.

                    <span>India skittled out for just 78 on first day at Headingley
England openers respond with unbeaten century stand

Jimmy Anderson could scarcely contain his delight after a dreamy first day of the third Test against India gave England a vice-like grip on proceedings. 
Anderson’s three‑wicket new-ball burst helped to skittle the tourists for just 78 all out – the ninth lowest total in their history – before unbeaten half-centuries from Haseeb Hameed and Rory Burns took Joe Root’s side to 120 for no loss at the close.

                    <span>Faced with crowd stampedes and Taliban reprisals, even those eligible for travel to UK have begun to give up hope
For the past four days, Nangyalai, a 42-year-old minicab driver from south London, has been queueing with his wife and 11-month-old baby outside the Baron hotel on the edge of Kabul airport, trying to get close enough to the entrance gate to show guards his British passport.
There is a sign by the gate stating “British passport holders only”. Inside the hotel, officials are working to grant evacuation visas for thousands of UK nationals and Afghan citizens who have worked for British organisations. Diplomatic staff say they are “processing hundreds every hour”, but there is a growing sense of despair among the crowds who have been waiting outside since the start of the week – and tensions are rising.

Guileless hero Christopher Blank is ‘born without a single funny bone in his body’ in a one-man play that paints a near future US in broad brushstrokes
Comedians becoming politicians and pundits. Politicians playing the lovable buffoon. Are we edging into a world that overvalues humour and ostracises the serious-minded? That’s the dystopia imagined in John Feffer’s one-man play, which traces the journey of Christopher Blank, “born without a single funny bone in his body”, through a near-future US where a lack of humour is a crime. It’s a grabby premise and I’m absolutely here for an inquiry into the insidious uses of humour in public life. But its relationship to our current reality feels tenuous.
Not that there’s any gainsaying Feffer’s expertise: by day, he’s a foreign policy expert at Washington DC’s Institute for Policy Studies. In a performance recorded at Baltimore Theatre Project earlier this year, he plays both our guileless hero Christopher and the wisecracking Groucho Marx-alike President Gumball; other characters are projected (video design by Kelly Colburn and Dylan Uremovich) on to a stacked-boxes set. We watch as social misfit Christopher is cast out by his uncomprehending parents, co-opted at university by a revolutionary cadre of humour-phobes, then caught up in a cold war between the US and the so-called Federation, a USSR-alike where jokes are strictly samizdat.

It’s 11.23am and Virat Kohli is jogging down the Headingley steps. The sky is a watery grey, the air is thick with cheers and boos and India are four for two. In his 15-year career as a batter and captain, Kohli has pretty much seen it all. He has played international cricket in 17 countries, overcome adversity of every sort, faced down every kind of challenge in every format. But he has never won the toss at Headingley before.

British nationals of Afghan origin are being overlooked in the evacuation from Kabul, lawyers and campaigners have claimed, as Dominic Raab said nearly all single-nationality UK citizens had been airlifted from the Taliban-controlled country.
About 50 British citizens, many with dual Afghan nationality, were understood to be outside Kabul airport on Wednesday. Some said they were waving their UK passports aloft in a desperate effort to flee as the deadline for western forces’ departure closed in.

There are several reasons to commit hours of your life to a TV series: to be provoked, to laugh, to explore universal elements of the human condition, to become totally absorbed, to be turned on by voyeurism, fashion/wealth porn or hotness, to have fun (whether intentionally or not). Nine Perfect Strangers, the Hulu limited series which premiered on 18 August, would appear to offer at least some of these draws.

In a statement released on Wednesday, the committee revealed that it has sent its initial demands to various executive branch agencies including the National Archives and Records Administration, the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Interior and Justice, the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

After all that, it took only eight words for Harry Kane to confirm the news most Tottenham supporters had been desperately hoping to hear. Yet while the England captain’s tweet on Wednesday lunchtime may not have come as that much of a surprise following a summer transfer saga that has never really taken off, its contents were clearly designed to build bridges at the club he joined as an 11-year-old.
“I will be staying at Tottenham this summer,” wrote Kane in a message that will have certainly made the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, smile, “and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success.”

Industry bosses said urgent changes to the visa system were required as retailers struggle to keep shelves stocked, and restaurants run out of food and drink in the meltdown triggered by Covid and Brexit.

Most of the system that puts food on the 21st-century table is a mystery to the consumer, who is usually happy in ignorance. If the complex logistics – picking, processing, packing, and distributing – make headlines it is because something has gone wrong.
Currently, two very big things have gone wrong, leading to gaps on supermarket shelves. One is the pandemic, which has slowed the movement of goods and people across borders, while raising shipping costs. Any broken link in global supply chains causes a cascade of disruption which affects many countries. But Britain has a second, aggravating condition to contend with – Brexit.

                    <span>Richer countries must wake up and see the bigger Covid picture
The statistics are stark and shaming. During an exasperated intervention earlier this week, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that of 4.8bn Covid vaccine doses delivered around the world to date, around 75% have gone to just 10 countries. The level of vaccine donations from richer countries, he added with some understatement, has been “really disappointing”. In Africa, where a third wave of the virus has been on the march since May, less than 2% of the continent’s population has received a first dose. While high-income countries across the globe have administered around 100 doses for every 100 citizens, the equivalent figure for low-income countries is 1.5.
As a consequence, while the United States, Britain and other richer nations begin to roll out programmes for booster shots in the autumn, a pandemic of the unvaccinated continues unabated elsewhere. The WHO’s target of reaching 10% of the population of every country with a first shot by the end of September is unlikely to be met. This grotesque inequity, as Mr Ghebreyesus and others have repeatedly pointed out, is ultimately in no one’s interest. Allowing much of the planet to operate as a variant factory, and the more transmissible Delta variant to run riot, stores up trouble for the future. “Vaccinating the world” should therefore be seen as sound strategy as well as an ethical obligation. But, in Europe and North America, early good intentions have so far come a distant second to domestic priorities.

Turkey has said it expects to be removed from the UK’s travel red list within days, as ministers prepare to update the traffic light system for the final time this summer.
Before changes are due to be signed off by the government on Thursday, there is also pressure for restrictions to be eased on passengers arriving from Pakistan.

Archaeologists have discovered ancient DNA in the remains of a woman who died 7,200 years ago in Indonesia, a find that challenges what was previously known about migration of early humans.
The remains, belonging to a teenager nicknamed Bessé, were discovered in the Leang Panninge cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Initial excavations were undertaken in 2015.

                    <span>In Australia, garment manufacturing is powered by a workforce fearful of catching Covid. In what should be a busy time, factories now stand empty
When coronavirus hit international fashion manufacturing centres last year, many Australian designers pivoted to making clothes onshore. But as Sydney’s lockdown extends into the second half of 2021, garment factories are struggling to stay open and the long-term viability of manufacturing in Australia is under threat.
Sydney’s inner west is usually a busy hub of clothing manufacturing. But the machinists who power this industry often commute in from the city’s south west, an area subject to the strictest lockdown orders in New South Wales.

Dame Sarah Storey isn’t usually one for public displays of emotion. The 43-year-old has competed relentlessly for almost 30 years, across two sports and at eight Paralympic Games, but has rarely shown so much as a glimpse of vulnerability. But as she clasped her 15th gold medal in the Izu Velodrome on Wednesday, the thought of her absent family made her break down in tears.
“It’s hugely difficult being without them,” she said after her victory in the 3,000m individual pursuit. “It is really, really hard. You know, they are the biggest motivation. But now I can’t be with them and share it with them and after all of the things they put up with. They do so much to enable me to do this. I am hugely grateful to them.”

Police deploy Taser stun guns too often, with black people more likely to face prolonged use lasting over five seconds, an official report has found. 
The study by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) warned of a loss of legitimacy after a review of 101 Taser cases from 2015-20. They represent the most serious cases it investigated, and a fraction of more than 94,000 uses over that period – leading police to attack the findings as selective and out of date.

A first poster has been released for Spencer, the forthcoming film about three days in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, starring Kristen Stewart and directed by Pablo Larraín. The poster comes a week before the biopic is due to premiere at Venice film festival.
The image appears to show Stewart bent double and weeping into a vast white gown, likely to be a version of the “Diaghilev” gown Diana Spencer wore on occasions such as a visit to the Royal Opera House and the film premiere of The Living Daylights. It was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who also created her wedding dress.

With the disturbing news that the window for evacuations from Afghanistan is closing (UK evacuation from Kabul to end within ‘24 to 36 hours’, defence sources say, 24 August), all governments should ask themselves: what is the moral response to this deepening crisis?
We urge the British government to go further in helping at-risk Afghans, human rights defenders and women activists, and create safe passages so that people can find sanctuary without resorting to dangerous journeys. We have seen in our parishes the warm response to refugees from Afghanistan and other parts of the world. As a nation, we should not be led by a quota, but by the need and pain before us.

Re your report (Nuclear storage plans for north of England stir up local opposition, 23 August), it is no surprise that ongoing discussions to choose locations for the dumping of nuclear waste are cloaked in secrecy.
Over the last decade, the nuclear power industry has successfully rebranded an appallingly toxic energy industry as “zero carbon” and even “clean” (Zero-carbon electricity outstrips fossil fuels in Britain across 2019, 1 January 2020) by never mentioning the terrible legacy of nuclear waste. Nuclear energy is neither clean nor zero-carbon when you consider its complete fuel cycle, from uranium mining overseas to the energy-intensive production of fuel rods to the management of highly toxic radioactive waste products such as plutonium.

With most formal Covid restrictions all but melted away, freedom prevails. Back to the workplace, Tory ministers make demands of our newly liberated workforce: the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, warns young workers that continuing to work from home may risk their careers. Though markedly softer in tone than last summer – when ministers demanded, through the press, to “Go back to work or risk losing your job” – the message is clear, at least in England: pubs and bars may be thronged again, but the ancien regime of work must be restored in full.
Yet as wars have disrupted the old ways of doing things, spurring on demands that widespread sacrifice should be rewarded with new rights and freedoms, so it should be with the pandemic. In her successful campaign to become general secretary of Britain’s largest private sector union, Unite, Sharon Graham said the organisation “should get back to the workplace and deliver what it says on the trade union tin – a relentless fight for jobs, pay and conditions”.

Germany’s Green party has been accused of attempting to revive its hippyish origins rather than tackle the challenges of the present with the release of a campaign ad for next month’s federal election that revives a 19th-century folk song.
Five weeks before a general election, in which at one point the party was leading in the polls, the one-minute-long commercial is being seen by some critics as a deliberate and last-ditch attempt to appeal to as wide a constituency as possible as it battles for second place against the resurgent Social Democrats.

                    <span>Celebrated artist admired for her paintings of flowers and the first woman to be elected to both the Royal and Royal Scottish academies
In 1994, the year that Damien Hirst made his first vitrined sheep, Away from the Flock, pickled in formaldehyde, the artist Elizabeth Blackadder, who has died aged 89, finished a work called Still Life With Cats. The cats were painted in oil on canvas, joining many others in Blackadder’s oeuvre, alongside arum lilies, Japanese fans and tins of sweets.
Mere difference of age does not explain the gap between Blackadder’s art and Hirst’s. Painters of her own generation – Bridget Riley was born in the same year, 1931 – worked in a style that was insistently modern. This was not Blackadder’s way. When she and her husband, the artist John Houston, visited New York in 1969 on the way to paint the Wyoming landscape, they made trips to the Museum of Modern Art to see Picasso and Matisse, not Pollock and Warhol. Modern art institutions returned the compliment: there are only half a dozen or so Blackadders in the Tate, all but one of them lithographs, few ever on show and none more recent than 1963. The British Council Collection holds only two Blackadders, the Arts Council’s none at all. And yet, there is more to the story than meets the eye.

Evidence Joel has joined black health organisations such as the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT), and NHS Blood and Transplant, to launch a blood donation campaign in memory of her son.

                    <span>A prolonged malaise caused by deep-seated structural problems has prevented a full economic recovery post-2007
Every year since 1978 the world’s central bankers have gathered to chew the fat at Jackson Hole in the Grand Tetons. This year’s star attraction is the most influential central banker of them all – Jerome Powell – and financial markets will hang on every word from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Powell won’t reveal much and for good reason: he doesn’t have all that much to say. He is worried about inflation but there are also signs the US economy is slowing as coronavirus infection rates rise. The pace of recovery is moderating in the UK, Germany, China and pretty much everywhere else as well. There are shortages of materials and labour. In a world of lockdowns, quarantines and travel restrictions, it is proving harder to sustain a model built around frictionless movement of people, parts and finance. Global supply chains are under pressure.

                    <span>Nia DaCosta’s quasi reboot develops the horror myth as an expression of rage against racism in the era of Black Lives Matter
Candyman, in its first incarnation, stepped daintily out of the mirror in 1992, in writer-director Bernard Rose’s US-set version of the Clive Barker novella The Forbidden, a parable of English class shame set in a Liverpool housing estate. Rose shifted the locale to Chicago’s deprived Cabrini-Green projects, switched the racial identity of the demon from white to black and gave filmgoers that inspired premise of exactly how he is summoned by rash unbelievers and giggling teens. Since then, Candyman has spawned sequels, references, memes and gags: such as Handyman – say his name five times in the mirror and he shows up three hours later and does a horrific job on your boiler.

                    <span>Vogue, Harper’s and Elle turn the spotlight on razzle dazzle and bright colours as we emerge from Covid gloom
In an unusual move, the cover of British Vogue features the time the photograph on it was shot: 4.57am. The image, of actor and activist Gemma Chan reclining on a boat on the Thames as the sun rises, is symbolic of a new dawn in this September’s glossy magazines. The biggest, bulkiest and most important of the year, they signal what can be expected in the industry in the months ahead. This year, though, they herald not just a new season but what can be expected from post-pandemic dressing (even if the pandemic isn’t yet fully in the rear-view mirror).
From Vogue to Elle and Harper’s Bazaar, this year’s offering, which is slimmer on the ground than in recent years, since Marie Claire stopping print in 2019 and Katy Grand exited Love Magazine last year, seem to be on the same page in terms of laying out new sartorial spirit. Now is the time, they say, for sequins and silver and dressing up for parties and going out-out rather than dressing down for sofas. Just as, after the first world war and the 1918 flu pandemic, the 1920s brought flappers and flamboyance, this new dawn is the 21st century’s own roaring 20s. And the vibe is one of hedonism and creativity after the Covid restrictions caused stasis and the rise of elasticated waists.

                    <span>This year’s Karlovy Vary saw the premiere of a dizzying single-take drama featuring a potent lead performance from Graham as a chef enduring a nightmarish evening
Philip Barantini serves up a single-take headlong nightmare in this drama set in a restaurant, starring the formidable Stephen Graham as an up-and-coming chef called Andy who is running on pure adrenaline, and maybe something more in that water bottle of his. Without any cuts to darkness or a camera flash, Barantini follows the dizzying continuous action in the kitchens and out in the dining room as the pressure begins to take its toll on everyone. And if it looks a bit like TV sometimes, that could be because cookery shows with stressed-out gobby chefs yelling at people are all over television. One of those shows was actually called Ramsay’s Boiling Point.
Andy is seen showing up ominously late for work one evening, talking on his mobile, trying to juggle some tricky situation in his disintegrating domestic life. Already, his highly professional support staff are dismayed at his behaviour and how they will be expected to cover up for him, even as he takes it out on members of the team junior to them. His trusted seniors are Carly (Vinette Robinson) and commis chef Freeman (Ray Panthaki). Meanwhile, the front-of-house maitre d’ Beth (Alice Feetham) is far too ready to accommodate off-menu requests from annoying food influencers with big Instagram followings. There are many other plot-flavours in this seething stew, but the biggest nightmare is that Andy’s former boss, telly celebrity chef Alastair Skye (a fantastically unctuous Jason Flemyng) has chosen tonight of all nights to show up, bringing with him sleek food critic Sara Southworth (Lourdes Faberes); for all Alastair’s fame he is none too pleased at how well his former protege appears to be doing. Could his appearance be some sort of implied threat?

Gatwick airport is to press ahead with plans to convert its emergency runway for routine use, in a sign that the aviation industry expects demand to rebound in full soon after the coronavirus pandemic.
London’s second biggest airport will launch a public consultation next month on a scheme to enlarge capacity to a potential 75.5 million passengers a year – despite still only serving about a quarter of its pre-Covid traffic in August.

Apple knowingly lets underage users access apps intended for adults, according to an investigation by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), despite having asked for and recorded their dates of birth.
The investigation asserts a disconnect between the information Apple knows about a user, which includes their self-declared age, and the ways it polices age restrictions on its App Store.

It’s easy to find out when Ian Botham last played cricket, because there is Wisden, but it’s hard to find out when John Cleese was last funny. Some people think he had some moderately amusing lines in A Fish Called Wanda (1988). There was a period in the 2010s when he had an idiosyncratic vendetta and went around town saying “Michael Palin’s travel show” and then yawning, which a small niche found rather tickling.
It would be fair to say it’s not a recent body of comic work that has recommended Cleese for a Channel 4 show about “cancel culture”, any more than it is Botham’s sporting career that equips him to be the trade envoy to Australia for “global Britain”. They have been drafted in for the vibes.

Sharon Graham’s victory to replace Len McCluskey and become the first woman to lead Unite, one of Britain’s most powerful trade unions, may have come as a surprise to many. But not to those who know her determination and fearlessness.
Some say Graham, 51, was written off because she was a woman. Her refusal to bow to pressure to stand down to make way for a leftwing unity candidate, Steve Turner, who was judged most likely to ensure the defeat of the Keir Starmer-supporting Gerard Coyne, earned her “disgraceful” online opprobrium, some of which was unquestionably misogynistic.

The hot, dry and windy weather conditions fueling the huge wildfires that have besieged the western US this summer have increased in frequency over the past 50 years, a new study has found.
Since 1973, global heating has desiccated the west, driving increases in “fire weather” days from the Pacific coast to the Great Plains, according to research by the non-profit Climate Central. It found that the number of fire weather days increased steeply in parts of Texas and in California’s interior, and that southern Nevada, south-east California and swathes of New Mexico had the highest number of average annual fire weather days – with nearly a quarter of the year in some regions being characterized as having elevated risk.

Kabul airport’s air traffic now seems to be at a stable level due to an increase in military aircraft evacuating people, new Guardian analysis has revealed.
Fewer than 15 aircraft arrived or departed each day between 16 and 19 August, according to data from Flightradar24.

The vast array of superlatives attached to the Ryder Cup ignore the recent propensity for predictable outcomes. Since Europe trounced the United States in Michigan, 17 years ago, there has been just a single away victory. When that transpired, at Medinah, we all saw fit to brand it a “miracle”. The past three Ryder Cups have been won by the length of a par five.

More than 2,200 deaths have been recorded so far, while at least 30,000 families have had to abandon their homes. Many were sleeping on the streets when Tropical Storm Grace struck two days later, bringing high winds and pelting rain. But despite the hardship, many Haitians are wary of the massive international aid response that is under way

                    <span>When I served in Afghanistan I questioned Britain’s part in the war, but the scale of the human cost has made me fully reject it

Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South

I can’t speak for other veterans, but I was never certain of the legitimacy of our presence in Afghanistan. I wanted to believe I was there for the right reasons, namely to help the Afghan people and deter future terror attacks. But the doubts always remained, fuelled by witnessing civilians caught up in exchanges of fire, or seeing eerie ghost towns that had been abandoned after ceaseless violence.
For those who haven’t served in the army, it’s easy to assume soldiers are obedient and unquestioning. Yet as long as combat operations directly involve humans, doubt will always be part of the equation. Questioning the moral objectives of our mission was, for me at least, a necessary precursor to participation.

Afghanistan withdrawal – live updates

The Taliban have captured more than 100 Russian-made helicopters in various states of operability, the head of a Russian state arms exporter has said, but will be largely unable to use them with little access to maintenance crews and spare parts.
As the Taliban overran the Afghan army and took control of large stores of arms and vehicles, it also captured at least 100 Mi-17 Hip helicopters, a Russian-made transport aircraft procured by the US for the Afghan armed forces because it was comparatively cheaper and easier to fly than US-made UH-60 Black Hawks.

In 2011, Sam Fender was, by his own admission, “a little stoner” who had flunked out of his A-Levels in his hometown of North Shields, living with his mother in a flat with black mould on the walls. A decade later, he’s one of the UK’s best and most successful singer-songwriters: his 2019 debut album Hypersonic Missiles went to No 1, he won a Brit award, and his knack for writing songs about 21st-century disaffections marked him out from cheerier peers such as Ed Sheeran and George Ezra. His second album Seventeen Going Under, a superb record that channels the sound of Bruce Springsteen and the War on Drugs into an examination of his family, youth and frailty, is out in October.

Four weeks ago the Biden administration officially began implementing the child tax credit in what was hailed by Columbia University as an initiative that could “cut child poverty in half in the US”. Most eligible families have received just one monthly installment so far – but for many American parents struggling to make ends meet during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, it has already made a huge difference.
The American Rescue Plan – passed in March – included expanded credit payments, which increased from $2,000 in 2020 to $3,600 for each child under age six, and $3,000 for children ages six through 17, this year. The funds are distributed in monthly payments of either $250 or $300 for each child.

“Country was ‘mere seconds’ from reconciliation before the statue toppled: Manitoba premier,” ran the Walking Eagle News headline.

Coronavirus was “weaponised” by domestic abusers during the pandemic and police forces should remain alert to “Covid blaming” as an excuse or defence by suspects, a study has found.
The Domestic Homicide Project, established by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, revealed that domestic homicides in England and Wales had not increased dramatically during the pandemic but still remained at about three a week, with 163 recorded in the 12 months to March. This was similar to the previous year’s figure of 152 and in line with the 15-year average.

                    <span>He may have backed the world’s most successful rock band, but the late drummer worshipped his jazz heroes through big bands and other projects
Everyone knew that Charlie Watts’s heart was always in jazz. Even when he grew his hair long and put on hippie garb while the Rolling Stones were going through their Satanic Majesties period, underneath he was still the cool bebopper who could see through the nonsense that surrounded his group and the rampaging egos at its heart.
Wisely, he never let his true musical allegiance show in his playing with the Stones. When they recruited him from Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated in January 1963, not long after he’d been serving an apprenticeship with trad jazz bands, he listened to the records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters in order to absorb the way that master Chicago blues drummers such as Earl Phillips, Fred Below and Elgin Evans kept things simple, soon appreciating that simplicity is often the hardest thing of all to achieve.

                    <span>Australians are very protective of their national cake, and with good reason, but who makes the best?
Lamingtons are one of those things, like Tim Tams and toad racing, that are big in Australia but, despite the best efforts of the residents of Ramsay Street, almost unknown elsewhere. Antipodeans of my acquaintance, however, go into nostalgic raptures at the very mention of these little cakes, a staple of Australia Day celebrations and school bake sales. (One friend claims he ate two a day as a child, so he may well be the only person who’s ever lost weight by moving to the UK.)
Said to have been named after – or, by those less familiar with the culinary skills of your average Victorian aristocrat, invented by – a former governor of Queensland, it’s also been appropriated, not uncontroversially, by New Zealand (food writer Irina Georgescu informs me that the same cake is also very popular among the Swabian community in Romania and Germany). Far be it from me, a mere Pom, to comment on the issue, but I will say that whoever came up with them was a clever little sausage.

One night 14 years ago, Hawa Bah crept out of her house in Guinea and slipped into the darkness. She says she had lost count but it may have been her 14th or 15th escape attempt from an abusive marriage she was forced into with a man 37 years her senior.
Bah made her way through a maze of streets to the meeting point where a car was waiting with two strangers inside. When they took her to the airport, Bah felt her heart beating through her chest. She had not realised until then that she would be leaving her country. Aged 17, she had no belongings and no idea where she was going.

                    <span>Hays Travel call centre workers providing 119 service for government advised on time they can spend on ‘comfort breaks’

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Private call centre staff subcontracted to work on Covid test-and-trace services have been advised to limit time away from answering phones to 10 minutes on a six-hour shift and told they might not be paid for breaks, the Guardian has learned.
The workers, who answer calls from home for the government’s 119 Covid number, have to select “comfort break” on their computer before using the toilet and are told to minimise time spent on such absences, or on fetching food or drink, or praying.

                    <span>By boosting dominant species such as great tits, human-provided food can make life harder for many woodland birds
Feeding birds is hard-wired into our national psyche. The apocryphal Victorian “tuppence a bag” for seed for the Trafalgar Square pigeons has morphed into a national pastime, with an estimated 17m households spending £250m a year on more than 150,000 tonnes of bird feed – enough to feed the entire breeding population of the 10 most common feeder-using bird species year-round three times over.
The habit has been enthusiastically encouraged by environmental NGOs, which recognise it as a way for people to connect with nature. This was brought into sharp relief during the pandemic, with many of us discovering the joy of attracting birds to our own gardens after losing access to wildlife and wild spaces. So we know that bird-feeding can be good for humans, but what about for birds?

The former European Union trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, has warned Australia is becoming “more and more isolated” on climate action at a time when floods, fires, droughts, and the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows global heating “is created by humanity”.
Malmström told a webinar hosted by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute on Wednesday climate change was “the most urgent global crisis we are finding ourselves in – and we don’t have much time”.

Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on one of rock music’s most iconic album covers – Nevermind by Nirvana – is suing the band, claiming he was sexually exploited as a child.
In a lawsuit filed in a Californian district court against numerous parties, including the surviving members of the band, Kurt Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, and the record labels that released or distributed the album in the last three decades, Elden alleges the defendants produced child pornography with the image, which features him swimming naked towards a dollar bill with his genitalia visible.

                    <span>Feline fancies began in the UK in 1871, with proud cat owners grabbing the chance to show off their perfect pets. What is the secret of their enduring appeal?
The air in the sports centre has a base note of urine. A soundtrack of plaintive mewling is interrupted occasionally by the sharp scratch of a hiss. Humans dart around the floor, attending to the whims of their lusciously furred, bouffant companions. Hairbrushes are wielded; coats are teased to 80s volumes. Over the PA system, an announcement is made. “Long-haired kittens are required in ring five!”
The first cat show took place in Crystal Palace, south-east London, in 1871. I have come to the LondonCats Worldwide (LCWW) 150th anniversary celebration show. Over two days, 200 competitors will converge on the Crystal Palace national sports centre, cat carriers in hand. In six rings along one wall of the show floor, judges will assess each animal for temperament, condition and conformity to the breed standard, before an audience of paying spectators.

                    <span>As the pandemic drives calls for a radical overhaul of the food system, can the president take on the meat giants?
Both the planet and US politics have heated up in tandem over recent decades, but few sectors have stewed in controversy quite like America’s beef industry. Four super-powered meatpackers control more than 80% of the US beef market, an extraordinary concentration of market power that the Biden administration is not happy about. 
A recent executive action signed by the president aims to increase competition in the beef industry, with the White House noting that, over the past five years, “farmers’ share of the price of beef sales has dropped by more than a quarter – from 51.5% to 37.3% – while the price of beef has risen”. 
But how were the big four meatpackers able to capture so much of the US beef processing capacity? They had help.

                    <span>Today the media are looking for scapegoats, but 20 years ago they helped facilitate the disastrous intervention
Everyone is to blame for the catastrophe in Afghanistan, except the people who started it. Yes, Joe Biden screwed up by rushing out so chaotically. Yes, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab failed to make adequate and timely provisions for the evacuation of vulnerable people. But there is a frantic determination in the media to ensure that none of the blame is attached to those who began this open-ended war without realistic aims or an exit plan, then waged it with little concern for the lives and rights of the Afghan people: the then US president, George W Bush, the British prime minister Tony Blair and their entourages.
Indeed, Blair’s self-exoneration and transfer of blame to Biden last weekend was front-page news, while those who opposed his disastrous war 20 years ago remain cancelled across most of the media. Why? Because to acknowledge the mistakes of the men who prosecuted this war would be to expose the media’s role in facilitating it.

                    <span>Violence, when it happens, is clumsy and banal. The possibility of a repeat kicking lurked around every corner and the hometown I loved was cast in sinister hues
The first time I was beaten up in the street I was 16 and had intervened when a boy tried to throw a friend of mine through a shop window. The third time, I had my nose broken at 2am in Luton for laughing when three jeering lads called me “John Travolta” (a reference to Grease, presumably; I was going through a big Rocket From The Crypt phase).
But the second time was the most significant. It was 1993, the summer before I failed my A-levels majestically, and two friends, D and M, and I were stumbling home several miles from a Durham nightclub (whose door was run by a young Dominic Cummings) back to our estate outside a north-east town. We were innocent indie kids; we played in punk bands, changed hairstyles regularly and took absolutely nothing seriously save for books, music and high times. We were not fighters. Life was for laughing at.

                    <span>Fashion and beauty expert David Yi has written a book that reveals how prejudice has kept men’s beauty routines hidden
The history of the male beauty ritual has been largely undocumented – and forgotten about – due to a combination of gender prejudice and misogyny, according to a new book by David Yi, writer and founder of the gender-inclusive skincare website Very Good Light. “For centuries, it is as if speaking about a king’s cosmetics predilections or a famed ruler’s aesthetics meant they were feminine which meant them being less powerful,” he says. 
The author of Pretty Boys: Legendary Icons Who Redefined Beauty concludes that history omits the grooming rituals of leaders and rulers in an attempt to put a modern, heteronormative-filter on the past. Yi says: “Many historians are fearful that the men they have studied and revered would be stripped of their dignity, or perhaps even deemed less powerful, if it was discovered that they wore makeup or had a passion for being pretty.”

Lucy Dawson was skating through life. Everything came so easily to her: she had friends, confidence, academic success. At the age of 20, she was studying criminology at the University of Leicester, determined to join the police. Then, in the summer of 2016, she got a terrible headache that refused to go away.
The headache was to change Dawson’s life. It took almost four months for her to be diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the brain that leaves many people with permanent brain damage and has a mortality rate of about one in 10. She was showing classic symptoms of encephalitis from the off (confusion, personality change, hallucinations and the headaches) which should have been spotted within a couple of days.

All eyes will be on Emanuele Mancuso, who has been revealing the clan’s secrets after accepting police protection. His testimony will be used against his uncle Luigi Mancuso, said to be the region’s most powerful mafia figure.

                    <span>Stress of pandemic could be behind increase in people aged 18-34, but number who quit habit also rose
The number of young adults who smoke in England rose by about a quarter in the first lockdown, research has suggested.
Nevertheless, the number of people who stopped smoking altogether increased, with the number across all age groups almost doubling during the first national lockdown when compared with the period immediately prior, researchers from University College London (UCL) and the University of Sheffield said.

Fifa, world football’s governing body, will receive over $201m in forfeited funds seized during a global corruption probe, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), said on Tuesday.
Since the DOJ unveiled the corruption probe in 2015, more than 50 defendants have been criminally charged. Twenty seven people and four corporate entities have pleaded guilty, and two people were convicted at trial.

Unwanted wool from lambs reared by farmers in Wales and south-west England for Waitrose is being turned into environmentally friendly mattresses for John Lewis.
Waitrose said farmers were struggling to find buyers for their wool, with the price paid often not even covering shearing costs, leading to the material sometimes being burned or buried. The tough market conditions have been made worse by the pausing of exports to China, a key buyer, during the pandemic.

Playwright Frances Poet nimbly entwines Sophia Jex-Blake’s groundbreaking battles with the story of her “official” biography in this audio play, part of the Sound Stage series by Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh.

Joe Biden has rejected the pleas of domestic and international allies to keep troops in Afghanistan for evacuation efforts beyond the end of the month, citing the growing threat of a terrorist attack.
In a move likely to fuel criticism that America is abandoning Afghan partners to the Taliban, the US president made clear that he is resolved to withdraw forces from Kabul airport by next Tuesday’s deadline.

In the wake of her breakthrough Wimbledon, this has been the challenge before Emma Raducanu as she has spent the past few weeks travelling around the United States and playing to crowds a fraction of Court One’s capacity. So far, she has thrived.

Mbappé has only one year of his contract remaining

Paris Saint-Germain are considering a €160m (£137m) bid from Real Madrid for Kylian Mbappé, with the France forward hoping to seal a move to the Spanish giants.
The 22-year-old has less than a year remaining on his contract in the French capital having turned down more than three different proposals from PSG to extend it over recent months. Despite the arrival of Lionel Messi from Barcelona, Mbappé has made it clear that he would like to move to La Liga after signing from Monaco on an initial season-long loan in 2017 before joining permanently for £165.7m a year later.

Britain’s evacuation from Kabul is expected to end within “24 to 36 hours”, potentially abandoning thousands of Afghans, defence sources said as the increasingly bullish Taliban moved to prevent them travelling to the airport to flee.
The US president, Joe Biden, rejected pleas from the UK for the humanitarian airlift to continue beyond 31 August at a virtual meeting of G7 leaders on Tuesday, triggering claims from Conservative MPs that the “special relationship” is over and that US-UK relations were “about to enter their lowest point since Suez”.

Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies aged 80
A life in pictures
Obituary

By any standards, Charlie Watts was an unlikely candidate for rock stardom.
He was quiet, drily funny and unfailingly modest, characteristics theoretically better suited to his initial profession as a graphic designer than the scream-rent world of 60s pop. Furthermore, by his own admission, he didn’t particularly care for rock’n’roll (“I didn’t know anything about it … I used to hate Elvis Presley. Miles Davis – that’s what I considered someone,” he told an interviewer in 1993) and had initially had to have the rhythm and blues so beloved of his bandmates explained to him: “I didn’t know what it was. I thought it meant Charlie Parker, played slow”.

Premier League clubs have united in defiance of Fifa and refused to release players for international duty in countries on the UK’s red list.
The escalating row over quarantine restrictions, and the lack of exemptions for players returning from red‑zone countries, led to Premier League clubs “reluctantly but unanimously” deciding to take action at a meeting on Tuesday. The Premier League, which has backed the clubs’ stance, has also registered its concern at Fifa’s decision to allow Conmebol teams to play three fixtures in the next two international breaks.

A hefty storm is brewing outside a ramshackle office on the isle of Guernsey, carrying with it stories of ghosts and ghouls. Written by James Milton and Paul Morrissey, with localised stories of whispers in tunnels and faces in forests, When Darkness Falls smartly entwines history and folklore. After a shaky start, this is a show that gets smarter and scarier as the night goes on.
Working for the Guernsey Historical Society, John (Will Barton) has stayed late to record a vlog with a writer and paranormal researcher (Alex Phelps). Looking back on the ghost stories that haunt the ancient island, the writer tells John five stories, testing his lack of belief with tales of witches, apparitions and unresolved revenge.

Last week the Morrisons board agreed a debt-fuelled £7bn takeover by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, in the latest round in a fierce fight for control of the country’s fourth largest supermarket chain. The 285p-per-share offer trumped that of a rival suitor, Fortress.

Britain’s economy has been plunged into a supply chain crisis, with major retailers’ stock levels at their the lowest since 1983 as a result of worker shortages and transport disruption caused by Covid and Brexit.
In a development that suggests recovery from the pandemic could be at risk, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said stock levels in relation to expected sales fell to their lowest level in August since it began tracking retail industry trends almost four decades ago.

                    <span>Activists earlier blocked Whitehall in protest against HMRC and Barclays over funding of fossil fuel industries
Environmentalist protesters have blocked another main junction in London’s West End, calling for “crisis talks” over global warming on the second day of Extinction Rebellion’s latest campaign of protest.
Protesters swooped on Cambridge Circus, in the heart of the capital’s theatre district, just after 3pm. Police managed to encircle gear brought in by activists, holding the middle of road as protesters danced around them to music from a mobile sound system.

Several UK energy suppliers have said they will raise the price of their standard gas and electricity tariffs to the maximum limit set by the energy regulator for the coming winter.
Ofgem’s price cap will climb to its highest level since it was introduced in early 2019 owing to a surge in global gas market prices. The regulator said that for 11 million households who pay by direct debit, energy bills would increase from an average of £1,138 a year to £1,277 from October.

                    <span>Ordinary Afghans will pay the highest price for the west’s defeated ambitions
It speaks volumes about the world today that a US president was more worried about the Taliban looking weak than about his western allies. Britain, France and Germany asked Joe Biden to continue evacuating civilians from Kabul past his self-imposed deadline of 31 August. But the US rejected these requests. Mr Biden wanted to end the chaotic TV scenes from Afghanistan that hurt his domestic poll ratings. But he also accepted that Kabul’s new rulers could not afford to look weak in front of their rival Isis, which is looking for an opportunity to embarrass its Taliban peer.
The west’s airlift will therefore be over by next Tuesday. It is the Afghan people who will pay the highest price for the west’s defeated ambitions for their country. They now face living under Taliban rule for a second time. There is no guarantee that a grinding civil war is over. The scale of the west’s failure is not just that the world’s biggest economies will almost certainly fail to evacuate all those who were employed by its armies and diplomats. It is that we have let down a generation of urban Afghans, especially women, who grew up believing that their lives would be better than their parents’.

                    <span>An embattled democracy’s struggles are not a priority for its western allies
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, could be forgiven for cursing his luck as the country celebrates the 30th anniversary of its independence from the former Soviet Union. On Tuesday, Mr Zelenskiy presided over a military parade in Kiev, attended by an impressive array of dignitaries and heads of state. But in a week when he hoped to concentrate the minds of western allies on Russian bullying and intransigence, their focus is firmly on Afghanistan.
The struggle to stay on the diplomatic radar has become a familiar one. On Monday, Ukraine held an attention-seeking summit on Crimea, illegally annexed by Vladimir Putin in March 2014. The European Union, with which Ukraine signed an association agreement months later, imposed sanctions, and refuses to recognise the territory as part of Russia. At the summit, the European council president, Charles Michel, promised that the EU would continue to “stand tall” against such violations of international law. But in truth, the Russian annexation is a fait accompli that no one now expects to be reversed. Sending late apologies, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel failed to appear at the event.

The festival’s directors said the crisis had had a devastating impact on the event, which until last year was the world’s largest annual arts festival. It was entirely shut down in 2020 and this year has operated at a fifth of its normal size.

 It’s “a risky time to be traveling right now,” David Ige warned on Monday, asking visitors and residents to limit their travel to essential businesses only. “I encourage everyone to restrict and curtail travel to Hawaii. It’s not a good time to travel to the islands,” he said.

Simon Akam is right, the military does want to ignore its failure in Afghanistan (Britain’s military will want to ignore its failure in Afghanistan. It must face reality, 22 August), but it does so by deflecting responsibility on to the politicians.
There is also a strong reluctance to publish books and articles that are critical of the military, even by those who served. All three books cited by Akam are by journalists who are ex-military.

In Italy, mandatory Covid tests required for travel have a fixed price of €15 set by the government, with a result provided within 20 minutes (Cowboy’ providers could lose approval to sell PCR travel tests, 23 August). This is a sensible and fair approach that is helping lead the tide of optimism in Italy. Perhaps it has something to do with the country’s health minister being so appropriately named Bob Hope (Roberto Speranza).

Arteta’s side face trips to West Brom and Manchester City

Mikel Arteta has admitted turning Arsenal’s fortunes around will “take some time” and urged supporters to get behind the team when they travel to West Brom in the Carabao Cup tonight before facing Manchester City on Saturday.
The 2-0 home defeat against Chelsea on Sunday left Arsenal without a point or goal from their opening two Premier League matches to increase the pressure on Arteta after failing to qualify for European competition last season. That meant Arsenal enter the League Cup at the second-round stage for the first time since 1995.

The return of Test cricket to Headingley after a two-year absence is bound to bring memories of Ben Stokes and that remarkable Ashes Sunday flooding back, be it the Western Terrace erupting after the winning runs were thrashed through cover or the sight of Australia’s cricketers collapsing to the ground in disbelief.
But while England’s predicament for the third Test against India, which starts today, is similar to the one faced before the all-rounder’s miraculous intervention in 2019 – sitting 1-0 down to the tourists, and in danger of surrendering their chances of a series win – times have certainly changed, most notably in regard to the players present.

                    <span>The shelves are empty. Yet leavers, though no longer triumphant, can usually blame the problems on the EU
Britain was not expelled from the European Union, although some of the dismay at the consequences of Brexit would make more sense in that scenario. Customs checks at the border are likened to a blockade. Rules that apply to all non-EU countries are described as punishment beatings. The expectation that Boris Johnson uphold the treaty he signed is cast as unreasonable spite.
This is all consistent with the sacred rule of English Euroscepticism, according to which “Europe” must always be understood in terms of things done to us by them; never things we do to ourselves.

The US could have the Covid pandemic under control and achieve a return to “normality” by next spring, Dr Anthony Fauci said, if the “overwhelming majority” of the population is vaccinated.

                    <span>It nurtured the likes of Helen Mirren and Zawe Ashton but its headquarters were cramped and miserable. Now a revamp has added a touch of Broadway glamour to the famous institution
A pink neon sign glows beneath a light-studded ceiling in the new entrance lobby of the National Youth Theatre, bringing a touch of Broadway glamour to the Holloway Road. Projecting out on to the pavement, occupying what was once a grotty car park on this busy London street, the new pavilion provides a suitably theatrical welcome to the revamped home for the institution – which had been all but invisible until now.
“Even one of the local councillors didn’t know we were here,” says the NYT’s artistic director, Paul Roseby. “Our sign was hidden behind the trees, the front door was always closed and people were shuffled in through a side entrance into a miserable lift lobby. Everything about the place was unwelcoming.”
After a £4m makeover, led by architects DSDHA, it’s now impossible to miss it. Clad in glossy green glazed bricks, oozing the jovial civic air of a Victorian pub, the new structure houses a community studio right on the street, with big shop windows giving passersby a glimpse of the action inside. “All we’re missing is a Hollywood-style Walk of Fame,” says Roseby. “One day I hope we’ll have stars in the pavement between here and the Odeon.”

                    <span>‘Alarming’ drop in workers signing up, with many put off by requirement to be fully vaccinated against Covid by 11 November

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

An army of volunteers could be needed this winter to tackle rising staff shortages in care homes fuelled by the looming requirement for all care home workers to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, providers have said.
As the health secretary, Sajid Javid, urged care workers to book their jabs in time to meet the 11 November deadline for all staff in registered care homes in England to be fully vaccinated, the Independent Care Group said operators could be forced to hand back contracts to councils or close care homes and relocate residents because of a staffing crisis, exacerbated by ongoing vaccine hesitancy among a minority of staff. It is leading calls for retired nurses, doctors, carers, to be trained and DBS-checked to fill vacancies in case of a feared “winter meltdown” in staff numbers.

A series of murders in Marseille has sparked a political row over the growing turf wars between drug gangs who are terrorising poor housing estates, where one recent shooting victim was only 14 years old.
Dominique Laurens, the public prosecutor in Marseille, warned this week that France’s second-biggest city was facing “a very difficult moment” as she detailed an explosion in violence and score-settling killings that were defined by “extreme cruelty and a complete lack of humanity”.

The location for the Paralympics opening ceremony, at least in the imagination, was that of the Para Airport. After all the dispiriting pandemic processes every athlete has been forced to endure after getting off the plane in Japan, they might not have welcomed the reminder, but there you are.
It was a different kind of airport though, one of sweeping colour, soft purples and greens, one awash with music and a place which gave flight to themes of creativity, endeavour and possibility. It also had 380 volunteers dressed in hats with big purple propellers on them, and you don’t get that at London Luton.

                    <span>Inspired by a Guardian article, the theatre’s surreal and spellbinding show AI is a collaboration between humans and the system GPT-3
Last autumn, a deep-learning computer programme wrote an essay for the Guardian. The GPT-3 system argued that humans had nothing to fear from robots. Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, read it and felt inspired. Could there be a future in creative collaboration between AI and humans? If AI could write an article, could it create a play too, in real time, before an audience?
The Young Vic’s new show, AI, explores these questions, casting the same technology as its virtual star. The production is not so much a piece of theatre as dramaturgy, rehearsal and workshop all in one, and contains its own riveting meta drama: a play is constructed over multiple evenings, culminating in a short show that combines human direction and performance with machine imagination and stagecraft (the use of algorithms to create its soundtrack, for example).

Social media platforms were buzzing on Monday after a post emerged that appeared to show the trailer for Marvel’s much-anticipated Spider-Man: No Way Home. Despite the poor quality of the clip, which seems to be filming a phone playing the watermarked trailer, fans across the world squinted at the footage to ascertain what lies ahead for Tom Holland’s Peter Parker as he appeared to encounter Doctor Strange, and some faces from the past. It was catnip for Spidey followers, who had become frustrated with the lack of promotional material for a film that is less than four months from cinemas. It has also been the subject of furious speculation, as Marvel’s multiverse arc opens the possibility of several Spider-men crossing paths.

The Paralympics begins this week, and we’re about to see some fantastic sport, from Ellie Simmonds in the pool to Sarah Storey in the velodrome. But, unfortunately, we’re also about to hear lots of cringe-worthy takes on disability.
The most jarring opinion I have repeatedly come across online is the idea, rooted in the “disabled shirker” narrative, that Paralympic athletes represent what all disabled people could achieve if they just applied themselves. If Hannah Cockroft can wheel 100m in 17.42 seconds, then surely the rest of us can at least make our way to a job interview?

Hasan Piker, AKA Hasan the Hun, AKA “woke bae”, has bought a house. If you’re extremely online then you’ll know exactly what this means and already have a strong opinion about it. If you are a normal, well-adjusted, human being then you will have no idea what I’m talking about. So, in brief: Piker is a 30-year-old dude who has gained a massive following through leftwing political commentary on the streaming service Twitch. Spending several hours a day ranting about politics on the internet hasn’t just earned him more than a million followers, it’s also made him a lot of money: Piker has just bought a $2.7m (£1.9m) house with a swimming pool in West Hollywood. Cue screams of “class traitor” and “hypocrite!”
Piker’s new pad has drawn a lot of criticism from fans who think he has betrayed his socialist values. It has also drawn predictable ire from the rightwing media, who have used the story to try to prove socialists don’t have any values. There is nothing conservatives love more than an opportunity to write a story along the lines of “FRAUD: self-proclaimed socialist buys something!” They seem to think that you can’t possibly critique capitalism if you own any sort of property. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example has been criticised by rightwing commentators for owning a nice jacket and a Tesla; Bernie Sanders has been slammed for owning three houses; Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter and self-described Marxist, has been dubbed a hypocrite for buying multiple houses.

Seven people have fallen ill after consuming a variety of food and drink from kitchens at Darmstadt Technical University in Germany, in what police suspect may have been an attempted poisoning.
Several students and members of staff experienced nausea and some watched their arms or legs turn blue after using kitchen facilities and a drinks machine at the university’s Institute of Materials Science on Monday, Hesse state police reported.

What’s the secret to great Spanish cooking?
Neil, Richmond
To read a list of Spanish pantry staples is to feel instantly hungry. Extra-virgin olive oil, salt and sherry vinegar, as Andalusian master chef Dani García of Bibo in London points out, make an excellent gazpacho dressing, and are also the foundational trio of Spanish cuisine. To these, add aromatics: white onion (for sweetness), lots of garlic, pimentón (smoked paprika) and saffron, the latter both in moderation.

                    <span>Musically-minded villain doesn’t really make this a feminist film, or bring much coherence to the mayhem she orchestrates
Another entry to chalk up in the neo-giallo wave currently being led by Prano Bailey-Bond’s Censor, this also flips the misogynistic precepts of the genre – in this case making the murderous point of view very much female. Kamia Benge plays music student Alexis, a young deaf girl who is far from being traumatised by an incident of terrible violence in her home, and instead finds that a meat tenderiser’s squelchy impact causes her to see a constellation of hallucinogenic lights – along presumably all the feels.
Years later, her hearing returned, Alexis (now played by Jasmin Savoy Brown) and fellow student Marie (Lili Simmons) are recording in an S&amp;M dungeon when the flesh-strikes start tickling her dormant synaesthesia – and she tries pushing the gimp beyond his limits. Out walking one night on a break from her music, Alexis shoves a street harasser in front of an SUV – causing a full-on multi-coloured synaptic big bang. Sensing the possibilities, this uncompromising avant-gardist decides to take her musically motivated pain infliction much further, giving new meaning to the term sick beats.

Rishi Sunak’s approval ratings tell their own story. The chancellor’s stock is high, because the Treasury’s furlough scheme has limited the job losses from the pandemic. But while Sunak has had a much better crisis than some of his colleagues, his record is far from flawless.
Two errors of judgment stick out: the “eat out to help out” discounts for diners, blamed for a wave of infections last autumn, and the decision to raise the threshold on stamp duty for home purchases in England and Northern Ireland from £125,000 to £500,000.

                    <span>Beefy At Davos is an episode of long-running sitcom The United Kingdom that we’d all like to watch
I am disappointed to note that a certain mirth has attended the news that Beefy Botham has been made a UK trade envoy. There seems to be some sense that his lordship is not up to the job, despite being a former cricketer with his own wine range, and despite the position of trade envoy being one that even Prince Andrew could manage for many years.
Not that Beefy has stepped directly into Andrew’s sweat-free shoes – Lord Botham’s appointment is Australia-specific, announced on Monday by pitilessly bubbly trade secretary Liz Truss. As she put it, “Ian will bat for business Down Under” – a statement that underscored the fact that if cliches were trade, Liz would be running a huge surplus. Alas, not everyone is as meaninglessly upbeat as her. (They couldn’t be: it requires suspending all critical faculties in the service of positioning oneself as the sort of glass-half-full person who would make a nice badminton partner or chancellor of the exchequer to a man who can’t bear bad news.)

The Danish shipping business Maersk said the investment in new vessels would help to ship goods from companies including H&amp;M Group and Unilever, while saving more than 1m tonnes of carbon emissions a year by replacing older fossil fuel-driven ships.

“Our catchphrase was, ‘What are they going to do, sack us?’” says Adam Hills. “We were only meant to be on air for 10 days, so we were happy to push boundaries. Little did we suspect we’d still be here nine years later.”
The Last Leg started life as a Paralympics spin-off to highlight Channel 4’s coverage of the 2012 London games. Host Hills called it “Three guys with four legs discussing the day” – he was born without a right foot, while sidekick Alex Brooker had his twisted right leg amputated when he was a baby.

                    <span>Online communities are not just used for propaganda but are valuable fundraising tools and crucial to recruitment
The Taliban took over Afghanistan in two weeks, ending 20 years of fighting with western troops and the Afghan national army. Many factors, such as a problematic peace deal, a lack of political will among the former Kabul administration to fight the Taliban and rampant corruption contributed to the group’s rapid advance and the fall of Kabul – but notable among them was a successful modern media strategy.
Prior to 2001 the Taliban banned the use of the internet, dismantled state-run television stations, ordered citizens to stop watching TV altogether and banned music. But after they had been ousted by international forces, the group rapidly expanded its online presence, starting in 2003 with a new insurgency. They launched a new radio station called Voice of Sharia, which had its own website, Al Emarah. Despite numerous attempts to block and remove it, Al Emarah has remained the official website of the Taliban. The site primarily contains battlefield news and videos, as well as the Taliban’s official statements. In the aftermath of their defeat, the Taliban focused their efforts on reviving the group online, “a virtual emirate”, as one scholar called it.

After watching Pedro Almodóvar’s Broken Embraces, which draws heavily on the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, I was determined to visit. A Google image search of the island made my head fizz: black sand beaches, alien-green ponds, mountains, great pyramids of ochre dirt and dead lava. In the summer of 2016, I finally booked a solo hiking trip there to mark the completion of my first book, Anxiety for Beginners. It was breathtaking, in all kinds of ways.
In the excitement of having written a book, the difficult experiences I had reflected upon in my childhood and teen years (a near-fatal illness and quite a difficult home life) had begun to feel a little academic – I wasn’t connecting to the person I had talked about on the page. I realised it wasn’t just the content of the book I had needed to process, but where I was in my life.

                    <span>Lockdown or no lockdown, the video-call date is here to stay. Experts reveal how to look your best, keep the conversation flowing and turn that online spark into a face-to-face meeting
As if first dates aren’t awkward enough, along comes video dating to add an extra layer of tech frustration and misinterpreted body language to the mix. During lockdown, video calls – either within a dating app, or on platforms such as Zoom – took off. But as restrictions lift, many dating experts predict the format is here to stay – or at least that it has become a helpful additional step. Dating apps rolled out video call functions last year, and Hinge found that 65% of people who had been on a virtual date planned to continue post-pandemic. Of Tinder’s younger users (Generation Z daters, in their late teens and early 20s), half have used video dating. So you may as well perfect your on-screen hairstyle, decide what to wear on your upper half and embrace it. Here are some tips on how to succeed.

It all began so beautifully, with the ruler of Dubai photographed planting the first tree of his ambitious environmental initiative, as smiling officials applauded around him.
In 2010, the One Million Trees initiative was announced by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai. The aim of the launch was to increase green areas in Dubai through afforestation, while contributing to overall beautification of the city.

During months of lockdown, homeworking and homeschooling, many families have relied on screens to teach and entertain their children during the pandemic.
We’re interested to hear from parents about their children’s screen time: Has the time your child spends in front of screens increased since the pandemic began, and if so, how do you feel about it? Do you think this has affected their behaviour or development? Are you glad about the myriad forms of entertainment and learning screens can offer, or do you wish your child spent less time in front of a screen?

It may be difficult to unpack, but shoppers could soon find the no-frills minimalism of Ikea has been lent a little glam-rock flair thanks to one of Britain’s most famous fashion designers.
Dame Zandra Rhodes has announced she had designed a line of homeware products for the Swedish furniture chain, a decision she made after painting her Billy bookcase “an iridescent Frida Kahlo blue”.

                    <span>The San Onofre nuclear power plant shut down years ago – but residents and experts worry what will happen with the waste left behind
More than 2 million visitors flock each year to California’s San Onofre state beach, a dreamy slice of coastline just north of San Diego. The beach is popular with surfers, lies across one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the Unites States and has a 10,000-year-old sacred Native American site nearby. It even landed a shout-out in the Beach Boys’ 1963 classic Surfin’ USA.
But for all the good vibes and stellar sunsets, beneath the surface hides a potential threat: 3.6m lb of nuclear waste from a group of nuclear reactors shut down nearly a decade ago. Decades of political gridlock have left it indefinitely stranded, susceptible to threats including corrosion, earthquakes and sea level rise.

The mobile phones of nine Bahraini activists, including two who were granted asylum protection and are now living in London, were hacked between June 2020 and February 2021 using NSO Group spyware, according to new findings by researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.
A report due to be released on Tuesday will reveal that the hacked activists, some of whose phones were being monitored by Citizen Lab researchers at the time they were hacked, include three members of Waad, a secular leftwing political group that was suspended in 2017 amid a crackdown on peaceful dissent in Bahrain.

Coronavirus – latest updates

British tourists face difficulties in proving their vaccine status in Europe following a delay in linking the NHS Covid pass to the EU’s system due to gaps in the British government’s application to Brussels.
An IT tie-up would ensure automatic recognition across the 27 member states of the information held on the NHS app, facilitating both international travel and access to hospitality where proof of vaccine status is required.

                    <span>As another series of the reality hit comes to an end – complete with a boring win by Liam and Millie – are its contestants merely going through the motions in search of Insta-fortune?
In recent years, Love Island has become as ingrained in the British calendar as April showers in spring, and that sludgy stuff that appears in the road when cars drive over fallen leaves in autumn. Love Island is summer, summer is Love Island and – as all seasonal phenomena must – it drew to a close last night. Deflate your novelty doughnut-shaped rubber ring; hang your bikini over a chair to finally dry.
The thing about events that come around every year, however, is that while they’re sometimes comforting, they can also be boring. Last night, denied of the banter outcome (that is, a win by Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran, a couple with the delightful, fizzy energy of two Beroccas dissolving in the same glass), we instead looked on politely as Liam Reardon and Millie Court were crowned the winners of Love Island 2021, the prosaic prom king and queen of the villa.

                    <span>Covid and the boom in streaming platforms are being touted as a huge threat to cinema-going. But so was telly. And surely we’re all desperate to leave the house and make a big social occasion of it all?
So are we in or out? Is this going to be the old normal or some new normal that the business still hasn’t yet grasped? As we look forward to what’s on offer in cinemas this autumn, we see new films mixed in with a deja-vu raft of old product delayed from the distant “before times” of pre-Covid. These films are beginning to feel like pizzas removed from the freezer cabinet, thawed out, and then unhygienically put back in the freezer. And of course we are all still absorbing the fact that Covid conforms neither to the accepted news cycles or movie distribution release structures. There could still be a fourth or a fifth wave. Cinemas could still be shut down again.
Covid might have changed the movie world temporarily or permanently or not at all, but as we fret fruitlessly about the discomfort of wearing masks in cinemas, the revolution could have already arrived in the new economy of streaming – which had been changing the game anyway.

Margie remains completely still. Around her in the sun-dappled woods, six dogs catch her scent and begin to circle. She pulls her head and legs inside her shell and hinges it shut, tight as a trap, but the dogs are clearly professionals.
Ruger, a one and a half year old Boykin spaniel, prevails. He clamps his jaws around Margie’s shell and carries the 25-year-old eastern box turtle like a trophy to the feet of turtle tracker John Rucker.

This law follows earlier restrictions by Viktor Orbán&#x27;s government on trans rights and adoption by gay parents. Patrik and Zsolt think gay people are the latest scapegoats for the governing Fidesz party, but Budapest&#x27;s Pride parade is an opportunity to protest against the new laws and to rally support.

Mani*, 21, began dating Noor*, 17, two years ago. They couldn’t see each other during the Covid lockdowns, but when restrictions began to ease, they would meet on the deserted banks of a canal in a small town in Tamil Nadu. The couple hoped to marry one day, but then Noor fell pregnant, and life turned into a nightmare.
Two months ago, Mani was charged with rape under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) law. After 48 days in jail, he was released on bail. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment.

The Woodland Trust has announced it is aiming to stop using plastic tree guards by the end of the year. It is trialling plastic-free options at its Avoncliff site in Wiltshire, including cardboard and British wool. The charity plans to plant 10 million trees each year until 2025.

                    <span>I fell hard for life in the Vosges in France. But when it got dark I couldn’t helped being spooked by every rustle, bark and footstep I heard. Then a night drinking outside changed everything
Eighteen-and-a-bit years ago, pushing 40, tired of England and keen to spend more time with my daughter, who was growing up in France, I packed in my job, left London and moved to the Vosges mountains in the east of the country. It was an idyllic spot: a little stark, vaguely unkempt, full of dark forests, crystalline lakes and gnarled locals with chainsaws in their sheds and bulldozers in their gardens. When they weren’t turning trees into firewood, they were digging out ponds – or possibly graves. In the second world war, they told me, there had been a murder near my home; the killer had buried his victim in a cabbage patch. But I digress.
Home was a draughty stone shack a couple of miles from the nearest village, down a dirt track flanked by spruces and silver birch. My nearest neighbour was a three-minute walk away, and when the birches were in leaf you couldn’t see another house. Indoors, I was plagued by dormice, and a shrew once dropped from the bedroom ceiling. Outside, there were red squirrels, buzzards and small animals that ran and squeaked in the undergrowth all day long. Sometimes I would open my front door to find a doe and her fawns cropping the lawn. I fell hard and fast for the Vosges.

                    <span>Trans children and their families still often face suspicion and suppression, but attitudes are changing
‘My preconceptions about trans people came from the media, and I certainly hadn’t heard of trans children. So it just flummoxed me having an assigned male child who didn’t have especially ‘feminine’ interests and yet was saying consistently, ‘I’m a girl.’”
Kate was telling me about her eldest daughter, Alex. (Names of all trans young people, and of their parents, have been changed for their privacy.) It was a warm July evening, and we were sitting in the kitchen of their family home, in a comfortable British suburb populated by middle-class couples with young families. Alex, still at primary school, is trans. A few years ago, her mum assumed she was a boy who was clumsily trying to ask for typically feminine things. “I remember I used to have conversations with her at a very young age in the car because she’d get really upset. I’d say: ‘But I don’t understand what would be different if you were a girl? What can’t you do that you could do if you were a girl?’ I’d ask: ‘Do you want a doll?’ She’d just reply: ‘I don’t like dolls!’”

                    <span>Famed since Roman times, the Spanish city’s artisans are all but extinct. But a reprieve is at hand from the TV and film industry
Its sturdy presence has threaded through more than 2,000 years of history, fuelled by fans that were said to have ranged from the Carthaginian general Hannibal to Roman legions.
These days, however, the longstanding tradition of swordmaking in the Spanish city of Toledo has dwindled to just two artisan swordmakers – the last living link to a tradition that stretches back millennia.

This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from earlier in the year. This episode was first broadcast on 24 May.
Email and text frauds are nothing new, but with a boom in online shopping during the coronavirus crisis, their anonymous perpetrators have hit on a lucrative twist. Rachel Humphreys hears from Rose, who thought little of filling out a web form to arrange the redelivery of a pot of face cream and set off a chain of events that would wind up with a fraudster emptying her bank account.

                    <span>The writer, ‘not naturally a public eye person’, reveals her ambitions as national poet with convulsive changes to the country and climate looming
Kathleen Jamie’s tenure as makar – Scotland’s national poet – is already a work in progress.
When the 59-year-old was formally welcomed to the role last Wednesday by first minister Nicola Sturgeon, she told reporters that the post “confirms a weel-kent truth: that poetry abides at the heart of Scottish culture, in all our languages, old and new”.

Children of women who were overweight or obese when pregnant have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer in later life, research suggests.
Obesity in women has previously been linked to health problems in their offspring. Among them, studies have suggested women who are overweight when trying to conceive are more likely to have a baby with serious birth defects.

Another accuser took the witness stand on Monday at R Kelly’s sex-trafficking trial, testifying that the R&amp;B superstar had sexually abused her on his tour bus and in hotel rooms when she was still a high school student and an aspiring singer.
The woman, identified only as “Jane Doe”, said Kelly had once beaten her with a shoe and wept when she also claimed that she had contracted herpes after having sex with him. She said he hadn’t disclosed he had a sexually transmitted disease.

The record-shattering rainfall that caused deadly flooding across Germany and Belgium in July was made up to nine times more likely by the climate crisis, according to research.
The study also showed that human-caused global heating has made downpours in the region up to 20% heavier. The work reinforces the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s landmark report this month that there is “unequivocal” evidence that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause of worsening extreme weather.

The leader of the Proud Boys extremist group was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn down from a historic Black church and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the nation’s capital days before the 6 January Capitol attack.
Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.

Speaking to MPs from Kabul, Sir Laurie Bristow, the British ambassador to Afghanistan, said trying to hold Kabul’s airport any longer would be fraught with risk.

The trademark flakiness has disappeared, substance finally accompanying the style, and there is no doubt that West Ham will keep moving in the right direction if they continue to trust in Moyes, whose strong and talented side looked ready to push for another top-six finish during their emphatic destruction of Leicester City.

                    <span>The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami is a story that didn’t need to be overdramatised. But Channel 5 appear to have missed the memo with this formulaic, melodramatic mess
The colossal scale of the Boxing Day tsunami – a 9.1 magnitude earthquake under the Indian Ocean displacing 30tn litres of seawater that hit the coasts of mainland Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India in waves that rushed at 500mph – would compel even if it were not for the human catastrophe that accompanied its incomparably destructive force. A quarter of a million people were killed. Entire towns and communities were wiped out. Survivors’ stories are uniformly harrowing.
There have been a number of dramas – most notably the Abi Morgan-scripted miniseries Tsunami, the Aftermath in 2006 – but Channel 5’s three-part film, following the minute-by-minute progression of the tsunami from the moment the two tectonic plates 19 miles under the sea finally ruptured at 7.58am on 26 December 2004, is one of only a few documentaries about it. Dr Xand van Tulleken presents the main thrust of the story – travelling to the affected areas as he outlines the terrifying phenomenon’s journey and interviewing those who were caught up in it. Raksha Dave visits scientists who explain the facts behind the waves’ emergence, evolution and effects.

Fueled by warm winds and drought-stricken vegetation, the fire, burning south-west of Lake Tahoe, surged through more than 30,000 acres in two days and by Monday morning had consumed about 106,500 acres.

“Any athlete you talk to, they have resilience,” said Shahrad Nasajpour during a press briefing in Tokyo on Monday. “Part of it comes from the athletic background, so any athlete you talk to they have it. But when you are a refugee athlete or Paralympian, which makes it even harder, the adversity behind makes you more perseverant in your life and in your career.”
Nasajpour, who has cerebral palsy, left his native Iran in 2015 and was granted asylum in the US. He was instrumental in setting up the Paralympic refugee team which competed for the first time in Rio in 2016, and indeed formed 50% of its number. Now, as part of a six-strong team, he will be competing in the F37 discus once again and when the Games get under way in Japan on Tuesday the resilience, perseverance and athletic talent that Nasajpour represents will be the qualities organisers hope to project to a watching world.

Don’t expect the shock of the new from the BBC Radio 4 stalwart, but audience suggestions and music really lift the second half
Is it a live show – or an impersonation of a live show? BBC Radio 4 favourite Dead Ringers takes up residency at the London Wonderground, with a compendium of sketches to tickle their fans. Many have already been broadcast; all are recited script-in-hand. Within those parameters, Duncan Wisbey, Debra Stephenson and Jon Culshaw deliver a likable hour of mimicry, in which the voices are always enjoyable, even when the jokes are uninspired.
Of course, we don’t expect the shock of the new from this 20-year-old institution. If we did, Culshaw’s dress sense – he’s wearing a smoking jacket – would soon disabuse us. Give or take a barbed remark from Wisbey, this is genteel satire-lite that couldn’t be more “Radio 4 comedy” (unreflective, a little pleased with itself, blandly non-partisan) if it tried. The opening stages, parodying the Today programme, are full of predictable news-based gags, making sport of sex-mad Johnson, abnormal Gove and policy-free Starmer. Elsewhere, there’s an off-putting fixation on the idea that Andy Murray is dominated by his mum.

Covid-19 deaths in the UK have reached their highest level since mid-March, data shows. The seven-day average for deaths within 28 days of a positive test now stands at 100, figures released by Public Health England on Monday show, a number that was last exceeded on 18 March.
Tributes to those who have died in the recent wave included some from the family and friends of Samantha Willis, 35, a mother of four from Derry who contracted Covid-19 while heavily pregnant and died 16 days later after having given birth to her daughter Evie Grace.

A Seychelles giant tortoise, a species previously thought to be a strict herbivore, has been filmed chasing and eating a baby bird in a “horrifying and amazing” attack, with researchers stating it was the first documented example of deliberate hunting in the wild by the species. 
The video, taken on Fregate Island in July 2020, shows a female giant tortoise slowly stalking a lesser noddy tern chick, snapping at it unsuccessfully before delivering a lethal bow by clamping its jaws directly around its head.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

As the number of recorded coronavirus infections in the UK rises again, we spoke to three people about their experiences of catching Covid despite having been fully vaccinated, and how it affected their daily lives.
Clare Jenkins, 44, from Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, contracted Covid this month after her 13-year-old daughter became infected at a party.

Tom Harrison and a group of senior executives at the England and Wales Cricket Board are poised to share a projected £2.1m bonus pot despite making 62 job cuts last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The most recent ECB accounts show that a five-year Long-Term Incentive Plan is due to be settled in cash in 2022, with the Guardian having learned that Harrison, the board’s chief executive who was paid £512,000 last year despite a voluntary pay cut, and Sanjay Patel, managing director of the Hundred, are among its intended recipients.

                    <span>Speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival about the scandalous lack of representation and disgraceful conditions my colleagues endure means underlining systemic failures
• Actors told they’re ‘too disabled’ for disabled roles in UK television
I had mixed feelings on being offered the MacTaggart lecture this year. The first was surprise: had anyone ever heard me speak? I once did a Bafta speech that Piers Morgan described on Twitter as the worst in the history of the awards. The second was disbelief that I had been afforded such an honour. The third was a sense of extreme responsibility. I knew it was an opportunity to talk about disability – or the lack of disability – on TV, how television gets key discussions wrong, and how I might dare represent that cause.
The issue of representation has reared its head in the past 10 years in particular. I am not going to use the word diversity because I don’t love the word. Diversity feels celebratory: “Look how diverse we are, aren’t we wonderful.” Representation implies a responsibility. If TV is not representative then it fails. And when it comes to disability, the failure is really stark.

• Jack Thorne: why it’s time to end TV’s deplorable prejudice against disabled people
Actors have been told they are “too disabled” to play disabled roles in popular television series, with parts instead going to able-bodied people, according to a leading screenwriter who has called for television companies to adopt quotas for people with disabilities.
Jack Thorne said funding for shows featuring disabled characters is difficult to obtain, disabled writers are regularly unable to attend script meetings because production offices are inaccessible, and recalled the time a friend who uses a wheelchair was forced to crawl along a muddy floor to reach her desk while working on a film shoot.

Ending lockdowns and other public health restrictions once 80% of the adult population is vaccinated could result in 25,000 deaths in total and 270,000 cases of long Covid, new modelling warns.
The work by researchers at three leading Australian universities predicts more than 10 times as many deaths as the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins the national four-phase roadmap. That plan was adopted by national cabinet in July but is subject to different interpretations by state and territory leaders.

But Covid-19 scuppered this. The Salvation Army was no longer offering delivery services, so after a couple of drinks one evening, Bowker turned to eBay. There he found a “sleek-looking black three-seater lounge – it was a flatpack you build yourself, with free shipping”.

                    <span>Lack of planning and coordination has left the west scrambling to do the right thing
At the weekend, in advance of Tuesday’s crisis meeting of G7 leaders, Boris Johnson tweeted that it was vital for the international community to work together to “ensure safe evacuations, prevent a humanitarian crisis and support the Afghan people to secure the gains of the last 20 years”. Had this exhortation been made at June’s G7 summit in Cornwall – when America’s intention to pull out of Afghanistan at reckless speed was already known – it would have been a little more impressive and meaningful.
Delivered belatedly against a backdrop of lethal chaos and confusion at Kabul airport, the prime minister’s words serve only to underline how little planning and coordination took place when both were urgently required. As a result of Joe Biden’s precipitate haste to get the withdrawal over and done with, and the negligent response of allies such as Britain, a humanitarian crisis is already in train. For tens of thousands of justifiably terrified Afghanis, the evacuation process is a dangerous lottery that represents a betrayal of the trust they placed in the west. The “gains of the last 20 years”, such as greater freedoms for women and girls, will now be subject to the internal politics of the Taliban, as it decides which face it wishes to present to the world.

                    <span>The liberalisation of betting has had some damaging effects and the industry should stop denying it
New Labour liberalised gambling in Britain with the 2005 Gambling Act, which introduced one of the most permissive regulatory frameworks in the world. The idea was that more betting would deliver economic benefits, and in one sense it did. The gross take from gambling has nearly doubled, with punters losing £10.2bn a year. The industry’s marketing spend has boomed. And HM Revenue and Customs has gained too: Denise Coates, who runs the Stoke-based gambling giant Bet365, paid £573m in taxes in 2019-20 – over £100m more than anyone else.
But along with the increase in gambling came rises in the harms associated with it. When the legislation was passed, concerns were focused on supercasinos. But what happened, instead of the creation of giant hubs, is that gambling (like so much else) moved online and to smartphones, where in-play betting during the course of a football match or other event became one of the most popular ways to bet. The other big change was the spread of fixed-odds betting terminals, from which gambling companies earned huge amounts: £1.8bn in profits each year until the maximum stake was slashed from £100 to £2 in 2020, following a public outcry and the high-profile resignation of a Conservative minister, Tracey Crouch.

The seven-day average for deaths within 28 days of a positive test now stands at 100, figures released by Public Health England on Monday show, a number that was last exceeded on 18 March.

The long-running battle to build an underground nuclear waste facility in the north of England has run into fresh problems, as communities reacted with shock to the news that they were being considered as locations. 
The north-east port town of Hartlepool is one of the sites in the frame as a potential site for a geological disposal facility (GDF), while a former gas terminal point at Theddlethorpe, near the Lincolnshire coast, is another. Cumbria, where much of the waste is stored above ground, is also being considered.

Two major Festivals – Glorious Goodwood and York’s Ebor meeting – have welcomed racegoers at pre-Covid levels, with the four days on the Knavesmire last week pulling in more than 83,000 spectators including 20,000 on Friday, a record for the third day.

                    <span>Letter to defence secretary says promise of visas is hollow without plan to evacuate guards from Afghanistan 
Dozens of cross-party MPs have signed a letter to the defence secretary calling on him to evacuate all the guards who provided security for the British embassy in Kabul.
Despite a commitment from the Foreign Office on Friday that visas would be given to all the Afghan security staff contracted through the international security firm GardaWorld to protect the embassy, the guards have still been given no information about if and how they may be helped to leave the country.

                    <span>Stereotypical Covid sceptics are a kind of fringe lunatic but elite sportspeople are reared to keep total control of their bodies
A few years ago, I was in India on an England cricket tour, watching net practice. It was a baking hot day at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi, and for the observing media the only available shade was next to a small marquee – really, just a glorified tent – that had been erected for the batsmen to pad up and the bowlers to take a breather. It was while perching in this very spot that I became aware of the surreal conversation taking place on the other side of the canvas.
“Have you guys heard of Julian Assange?” one of the England players was asking his teammates. “It’s a mad story. I was up till about 4am reading about it. He’s the Wikileaks hacker who published all these secrets about the US government and all their wars and stuff. And so what the US government did, they basically framed him for rape and tried to get him extradited to Sweden. It’s mad.”

                    <span>Analysis: Tuesday’s meeting called by Boris Johnson may include postmortem on Joe Biden’s handling of crisis
The emergency meeting of G7 nations on Tuesday – called by Boris Johnson as this year’s chair of the G7 – is in essence a gathering of the vanquished but faces a threefold agenda: how to ensure as many Afghans as possible can leave Kabul, and whether the US is prepared to stay beyond the original 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of all US forces; how a resettlement programme can be coordinated for the medium term; and finally, how to encourage the Taliban to form an inclusive government, including by threatening sanctions or withholding recognition.
But each country will bring its own concerns and an ugly postmortem on Joe Biden’s handling of the crisis cannot be ruled out.

                    <span>Readers respond to Alexei Navalny’s message from prison on steps that the west can take to tackle corrupt regimes
Alexei Navalny rightly asks: “If corruption is preventing us from finding solutions to the problems of the ‘big agenda’, has the time perhaps come to raise it to a priority on that agenda?” (Only action against corruption can solve the world’s biggest problems, 19 August).
In respect of the UK, this seems unlikely to happen because corruption – “the exploitation of an official position for personal gain” – is rife in the UK government also, albeit in a slightly less serious form than in certain other countries. For what is the funnelling of government contracts to manifestly incompetent companies run by cronies, or by political donors, if it is not corruption? What is the exercise of ministerial prerogative to benefit some individual, who shortly thereafter makes a donation to party funds, if not corruption?

                    <span>With children’s care in crisis, it is not enough to just paper over the cracks, writes Sue Hardman, while Prof Mike Stein recommends the implementation of progressive income tax and wealth reform to properly fund public services
Your editorial on children’s care in crisis (19 August) states that there has been a huge increase in referrals to social services, and notifications relating to domestic abuse. The article states that there is “no scenario in which increased spending can be avoided” on children’s care.
My fear is that any increase in resources will at best paper over the cracks, and be allocated to the sharp end of child protection out of sheer necessity. But if we truly want to make a difference to our children, then we need much, much more support for early intervention, particularly with regard to those children who have witnessed domestic abuse. NSPCC research reports that one in five children may witness domestic abuse. Any child who sees such abuse is at risk of suffering from poor mental health, not only in their younger years, but well into adulthood too.

Described as a “self-portrait in 154 songs”, The Lyrics will feature songs from throughout McCartney’s career, including Blackbird, Live and Let Die, Hey Jude, Band on the Run and Yesterday.

Growth is slowing and price pressures are mounting. Consumers are anxious and an important commodity is in short supply. That was the state of the UK in the mid-1970s, when a single word was used to describe a combination of recession and a rising cost of living: stagflation.
And, in a much milder form, it is the malaise that is afflicting the economy today. The shortage is of computer chips rather than crude oil but the latest snapshot from IHS Markit/Cips suggests businesses again face supply and demand constraints.

“I haven’t slept for a week or so … There are tremendous threats against their lives,” said the woman, whose mother remains in Afghanistan along with seven of her siblings. “I cannot tell you how much I have cried in the last four or five days. Every single day.”

Mogwai, Nadine Shah, Fontaines DC and more mesmerise in the festival’s overwhelming, glorious comeback
‘This is friggin’ overwhelming,” exclaims Nadine Shah, grasping for words to sum up the hyper-emotional, multi-sensory overload that was returning to a music festival. Everyone present for the Tyne and Wear singer’s revitalising set of blown-out rock’n’soul early evening Friday will have known exactly what she meant.
Arms jabbed, throats and noses swabbed, antiseptic liquids flowing along with the real ale and the tears: Green Man was back. As with most festivals, last year’s Covid-related cancellation imperilled this carnival of pastoral-psychedelic delight beneath the Welsh mountains. But its late summer berth allowed organisers to gamble on restrictions lifting in time for a full return in 2021. Fans kept the faith – most tickets were rollovers from 2020 – and were repaid with a programme that, despite few international artists, still somehow felt as solid as ever: a magical mixture of cosmic rock, alt-folk, ecstatic jazz and sanitised hands-in-the-air club music.

Imbecilic, tragic, dangerous and unnecessary are the words used by Tony Blair to describe the US withdrawal from Afghanistan – and Britain’s as well. The former British prime minister believes the west should stay to protect the “gains” achieved by his original invasion in 2001, and by implication by the deaths of 457 British soldiers. As it is, Britain has been “relegated from the top division” of world powers, its enemies are “cheering” and its word is no longer relied on.
The final duty any prime minister owes his successors is silence. Otherwise he invites the obvious retort: but it was your fault.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Finance ministers, central bank governors and political leaders are hard at work preparing for the 2021 G20 heads of state and government summit in Rome on 30-31 October. With the Covid-19 pandemic stretching well into its second year, the meeting will come at a time of heightened uncertainty about public health and the global economy. And though the mechanisms of international cooperation have been weakened by the pandemic and remain bruised by Donald Trump’s legacy, they are more important than ever.
“Cooperation” need not refer to international coordination of national monetary or fiscal policies. For the most part, countries on their own can move those levers in whatever direction is best for them. Instead, the G20 should focus on financial stability, trade and vaccination. This is in addition to other important areas, especially the existential issue of global climate change, which should and will receive a lot of attention.

                    <span>From Boris Johnson’s pledges that don’t add up to Sajid Javid’s visit to a ‘new’ hospital, NHS staff are being taken for fools
In my first year as a doctor, I witnessed the fetid reality of crumbling NHS real estate. Arriving at work one morning on the emergency assessment unit – the frenetic hub through which most of the hospital’s acutely unwell patients passed – I discovered it had ground to a malodorous halt. Men in hard hats were shouting orders to nurses, porters were evacuating patients on trolleys. I was told a main waste pipe on the floor above had ruptured, with predictably rancid and unhygienic consequences. So much for being an NHS teaching hospital of global renown: we were literally awash with slurry.
I was reminded of these unsavoury events by Sajid Javid, who tweeted last week: “Looking forward to opening one of new 48 hospitals [sic] later today.” Imagine bragging about building all those new hospitals when the existing ones are so rundown and dilapidated, they can’t even contain their human excrement.

Sarah Storey’s campaign to become Britain’s most-decorated Paralympian gets under way on Wednesday, when she competes in her eighth Games in Tokyo.
Now 43, Storey, 14 times a Paralympic gold medallist, is the leading British female Paralympian. If she successfully defends titles in the C5 individual pursuit on 25 August, and C5 time trial and C4-5 road race on 31 August and 2 September, she will go past swimmer Mike Kenny.

Squirrelling away little parcels of ’nduja, the intensely spicy and garlicky spreadable sausage from Calabria, in the fridge or freezer is the type of modern-day household management that I feel Mrs Beeton would appreciate; it’s the culinary equivalent of having some frankincense and myrrh in your back pocket. Its rich, rounded flavour comes from a chilli particular to Calabria, and its flavour melts and seeps into other ingredients, lending them some of its gutsy, sassy attitude. It is beautifully feisty in this seasonal tagliatelle.

                    <span>Tom Cruise doesn’t just have a single chicken tikka masala when he goes to Birmingham – he has another one straight after. Has any man ever been more on-brand?
When Tom Cruise commits to something, he commits. When a Mission: Impossible stunt called for him to climb up the outside of the world’s tallest building, he actually climbed up the outside of the world’s tallest building. When Collateral required him to become an invisible assassin, he temporarily became a Fed-Ex driver to teach himself anonymity. When he fell in love with Katie Holmes, he did it with such couch-leaping intensity that it derailed his career for half a decade.
So when Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, he really went to Birmingham to have a curry. When Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, he did it with the same vigour that he uses to ride motorbikes or jump out of planes or scream at crew-members for not following Covid compliance protocols. Which is to say that when Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, Tom Cruise went to Birmingham and had two curries, one after the other.

Thousands of activities providing life-saving support are being cut due to the government’s decision to reduce aid spending to 0.5% of gross national income.

Horrifying scenes are unfolding in Afghanistan. Taliban forces are reportedly going door to door, making blacklists of anyone who has worked with the former government. Even if Britain had not played a part in what’s unravelling right now, we would have a moral duty to act.
In this context, announcements from some UK regional leaders that they will accept Afghan refugees are welcome. But a years-long wait for resettlement cannot be the only protection we offer. The events unfolding in Afghanistan, with people forced to flee without a moment’s notice, show what it means to become a refugee and call into question an already rotten asylum system, which is due to go from bad to worse if the government’s new borders bill is passed.

The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed that growth in private sector output slowed to a six-month low in August.

                    <span>Climate-conscious individual choices are good – but not nearly enough to save the planet. More than personal virtue, we need collective action
Personal virtue is an eternally seductive goal in progressive movements, and the climate movement is no exception. People pop up all the time to boast of their domestic arrangements or chastise others for what they eat or how they get around. The very short counterargument is that individual acts of thrift and abstinence won’t get us the huge distance we need to go in this decade. We need to exit the age of fossil fuels, reinvent our energy landscape, rethink how we do almost everything. We need collective action at every scale from local to global – and the good people already at work on all those levels need help in getting a city to commit to clean power or a state to stop fracking or a nation to end fossil-fuel subsidies. The revolution won’t happen by people staying home and being good.
But the oil companies would like you to think that’s how it works. It turns out that the concept of the “carbon footprint”, that popular measure of personal impact, was the brainchild of an advertising firm working for BP. As Mark Kaufman wrote this summer:

Carter, who served two tours in Iraq, said: “I would really like to see some senior military and political leadership step up. I’m incredibly disappointed with the information that’s coming out of the Pentagon because it’s just not good enough. On behalf of my players and on behalf of military personnel there working their butts off to pull this off I’m also incredibly frustrated and I don’t know how much longer what’s happening is maintainable.

                    <span>Pretend you’ve got one foot in the Med with this cheerful medley of seafood in a chilli-and-tomato sauce that’s just made for tossing through pasta
Somewhere – probably in one of the shoe boxes in a larger box, Russian doll-style, under the bed – is a strip from a magazine. It is a cartoon of a man sitting at a table eating, while under the table his feet are in two trays, one containing water, the other sand. Over the table is a striped umbrella, across from another man. Both are delightedly drinking well-decorated cocktails and wearing sun hats and sunglasses, while on the other side of the room is a cat, looking unimpressed, presumably because his litter tray is being used for another purpose, or maybe because he is simply unimpressed.
When I ripped the strip, I had a particular friend in mind. One who refuses to be defeated by anything, especially regarding food. When it rained on the day of a barbecue, she was up on the roof suspending a makeshift awning. If rain turned into a storm, she would drag the grill into the largest available space and hand out cardboard for fume wafting. Her usual response to bad news or bad days is to invite people over for a meal, often with a theme, and she generally invents a new drink – the parma violet is particularly memorable, although later painful. If you are having a bad day, she will run you a hot bath, make you chicken and barley soup, and either talk, not talk, or keep you company while watching five hours of TV.

                    <span>Ashleigh, 33 and Matt, 32, met at a fancy dress party in Vancouver. They live in London with their son and three-legged cat
Matt had been living in Vancouver for a year when he was invited to a student fancy dress party in the spring of 2014. “I’d moved to study for a master’s degree in entomology,” he says. “Coming from Ohio, it was the biggest city I’d ever lived in. I’d never even ridden a city bus before.” The event had a lumberjack theme, popular at Canadian house parties at the time. “Everyone had to dress up in plaid and overalls, and there was a giant wooden Jenga game. You had to wear a hard hat to play,” he says. When he spotted Ashleigh across the room, he couldn’t resist going to say hello. “I thought she looked just like Kate Bush. I’d recently discovered her music, so I went to speak to her.”
Ashleigh had moved to Vancouver from Toronto to be with her boyfriend, but it wasn’t working out. “I had a job in a museum, but was living in a cockroach-filled apartment and had no friends. I wanted to meet new people,” she says, and an acquaintance invited her to the party. When Matt approached, she was busy trying to negotiate the party playlist with another guest. “I used to have a student radio show and was really into music,” she says. They talked for a while before Matt got the courage to tell her she looked like Kate Bush. “People have actually said that about me before,” she says.

                    <span>From the right way to exercise, to what to eat and drink and the case for HRT, experts explain how women can prepare for midlife changes to their bodies
Sometimes your body notices things before your mind does: you might think you’re so far away from the menopause that a hot flush is just a thing you can fake to get out of a boring situation, but your midriff knows better. Lucinda Meade, 57, is a physiotherapist and personal trainer. She has trained many clients through the menopause and says it tends to start with surreptitious weight gain around the middle, which they then can’t shift. It may be accompanied by aches and pains in smaller joints, and an unappetising smörgåsbord of “mood changes, sleep changes, annoying visits to the GP to be given antidepressants”.
All this makes perfect sense from a hormonal perspective, as another trainer, Sarah Overall, 51, describes: “Oestrogen governs so many of your bodily processes, and one of the things it’s involved in is water regulation. It’s a lot easier for tendons and ligaments and joints to become dehydrated. And that can also lead to a resurgence of old injuries.” Plus, “when your female hormones decrease, you go from having a gynoid shape, carrying fat on your hips and thighs, to android obesity, abdominal fat, which is a male shape.”

Mark Sanford is not the first Republican to turn against former US president Donald Trump and pay a political price. But he is unique in publishing a memoir that links his decision to lessons learned from an extramarital affair and his attempt to cover it up.
Sanford was the governor of South Carolina when, in 2009, he flew to Argentina to be with a woman who was not his wife but told his staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. The falsehood was rapidly exposed, made lurid headlines and ended his 20-year marriage.

Annie Murphy moves straight from Schitt’s Creek to another swearily titled series, this time a bold meta-TV experiment. Part classic canned-laughter sitcom, part dark crime drama, Murphy stars as Allison, a sitcom character who constantly has to stomach her doofus husband’s sexist jokes. But the moment she’s away from him, the show morphs into a different beast, and she plots to bump Kevin off by any means necessary.

My favourite part of childhood summer holidays with my dad was our trip to the Yorkshire Dales agricultural show, a respite from his usual gruelling regime of mountain walks and examining dead fauna. Between prize rams and displays of trimmed leeks we watched the fell-running races: infants and gnarled pensioners scampering up and then down a sheer crag, all for a biscuit and a certificate.
“Look at the little bastards!” Dad would exclaim, gesturing incredulously, plastic pint glass slopping bitter as wiry five-year-olds whizzed past, legs a blur. Lumpen by his side, mouth crammed with cake, I would feel an obscure longing: why wasn’t I a fearless, muddy-kneed dynamo?

                    <span>The Brazilian butt lift has become the world’s fastest growing cosmetic surgery, despite mounting concerns over the number of deaths from the procedure. What is driving its popularity?
This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from the year so far. This episode was first broadcast on 2 March.
Rachel Humphreys talks to Guardian writer Sophie Elmhirst about the increasing popularity of the Brazilian butt lift (BBL), which is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery in the world. Since 2015, the number of butt lifts performed globally has grown by 77.6%, according to a recent survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The BBL began in Brazil, birthplace of aesthetic surgery and the myth of the naturally “sticky-outy” bottom, the kind seen in countless tourist board images of bikini-clad women on Copacabana beach. As part of her research, Sophie spent time with the British aesthetic surgeon Dr Lucy Glancey and her patient Melissa*, who was planning to have her second BBL. Sophie tells Rachel why she thinks more and more women are demanding the procedure despite the risks – the BBL has been called the world’s most dangerous procedure.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said on Monday that 82 providers have been issued a two-strike warning for displaying lower prices on the gov.uk site than are available at the point of checkout, making up about 18 per cent of the companies on the government’s approved list.

The game was originally suspended in the 75th minute when Marseille players and Nice fans had to be separated after bottles were thrown between the two during their league match. An on-pitch melee ensued and the game had to be delayed by the match officials.

At least 22 people were confirmed dead on Sunday as rescue crews searched desperately amid shattered homes for dozens still missing after record-breaking rain sent floodwaters surging through parts of Tennessee.

Celtic have described racist social media footage – featuring travelling Rangers fans mocking the Japanese forward Kyogo Furuhashi – as “sickening and pathetic”.
Rangers have launched an investigation after the video, from a supporters’ bus, emerged on Sunday afternoon, when Steven Gerrard’s side were in Dingwall for a 4-2 win over Ross County. Fans were seen singing racist songs and making offensive eye gestures to mobile phones.

Boris Johnson will personally lobby Joe Biden at the G7 leaders summit, No 10 said on Sunday night, pleading with him to keep US troops at Kabul airport beyond the end of August, after a weekend of tension between the UK and its closest ally.
With the Taliban tightening their grip at the airport, Downing Street confirmed the PM would lobby the US president on Tuesday at the virtual meeting. The news came as Taliban forces sought to assert their authority, blaming the US for the “anarchy” at the airport and insisting they were the only ones capable of restoring order. Throughout the day, Taliban fighters fired their guns into the air and used batons to force people into orderly queues in an attempt to halt the desperate scenes in which at least 20 people have died.

When Ruby Wax Met … (BBC Two) gives us a double whammy of Wax, then and now, and proves to be an absorbing analysis of celebrity, fame and the massive cultural shifts that have taken place over the past four decades. In the 90s and early 00s, Wax pioneered documentary-style celebrity interviews, with the camera often rolling before she and her subject had even met. She spent time with A-list stars such as Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn and OJ Simpson (more on him later) and was granted a level of access that is unheard of in this age of brand management and “controlling the narrative”.
Now a writer, comedian and mental health campaigner, Wax says she has not seen these interviews for 25 years: “It’s another life. It doesn’t even feel like the same skin.”

Thomas Tuchel suggested Romelu Lukaku gives Chelsea “another dimension” after the club’s £97.5m striker scored on his first appearance after re-signing in Sunday’s 2-0 cruise at Arsenal.
That defeat intensified the already considerable pressure on a defiant Mikel Arteta, whose side – admittedly weakened by Covid – have not only lost their first two games of the season but are still to score a goal.

Nanna Koerstz Madsen is the latest golfer to come a cropper right in front of the Carnoustie Hotel. Amazingly, this capitulation did not even include a trip to the infamous Barry Burn. She was in with a live chance of becoming the first Dane to win a male or female major when taking to the 72nd hole in a 12-under-par tie with Anna Nordqvist.

Brighton and Hove council, which has been under Green party control since last year, has banned toxic weedkillers that include chemicals such as glyphosate after a petition from residents.

States are continuing to push back against the terms of a nationally agreed plan to open up the country once vaccination rates hit 70% and 80%, warning the worsening Covid crisis in NSW could yet be a dealbreaker.
As a pared-down federal parliament prepares to sit in Canberra on Monday amid the ACT’s lockdown, the prime minister Scott Morrison is insisting that growing case numbers are not a reason to abandon the national plan agreed to by all states and territories.

                    <span>The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. It is now set for its highest number of gun killings in 20 years
As Covid cases surge once more in the US, another public health crisis is pummelling the country too. Last year, gun killings soared by around 4,000, to almost 20,000 in total – the worst single-year increase on record. So far, 2021 looks even worse. In the first five months alone, more than 8,100 people died. America is set for the deadliest toll in nearly two decades.
Alarmingly, there is also a surge in gun purchases. The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. But last year saw a 64% jump compared with the previous year, to an estimated 20m guns. Around a fifth of buyers were first-time owners. The pandemic sparked a rush to purchase firearms, and some bought because so many others were doing so. The backlash against Black Lives Matter protests may have played a part. Black Americans saw the highest increase in gun ownership and, reportedly, Asian Americans also bought more guns, as hate crimes have risen. Sales have continued to grow this year, with manufacturers struggling to produce enough ammunition.

                    <span>An acute shortage of staff offers an incentive to improve a stressful working culture
White Heat, by Marco Pierre White, is one of the most influential recipe books of the past 30 years. Published in 1990, its edgy black and white photography popularised an idea of the chef-as-hero, immersed in the creative Sturm und Drang of a frantically busy restaurant kitchen. Its cover features a handsome 28-year-old Mr White in a butcher’s apron, looking moody and a little like Jim Morrison.
For most chefs the reality has always been much less romantic. Long, unsociable hours are often poorly rewarded, and a sometimes brutal workload makes cheffing one of the most stressful ways to earn a living. Burnout is commonplace, and a healthy work-life balance difficult to maintain. One 2019 survey found that eight out of 10 employees in professional kitchens had experienced mental health problems during their career. Research by the Unite union discovered that 52% of chefs have a negative view of their jobs and only 22% would recommend the life to school-leavers. Happily, there are some tentative early signs that the hospitality hiatus caused by Covid may lead to change for the better.

Following up earlier concerns about medical gloves for the NHS being produced in Malaysia, where there have been consistent reports of forced labour in factories, Emily Thornberry called for an urgent response.

Antibody tests are to be offered widely to the UK public as part of a new programme which a leading scientist said could lead to targeted booster vaccinations for vulnerable people.
Thousands of adults will receive tests each day as part of a government scheme exploring how much natural protection people have after getting coronavirus.

The children’s author and illustrator Jill Murphy, who has died of cancer aged 72, was loved across generations for picture books that capture the essence of childhood in a realistic yet magical way.
Her career began at the age of 24 when her first book, The Worst Witch (1974), was published. An immediate success, it has consistently been on every list of top recommendations for seven-year-olds ever since. Equally successful have been her picture books about the everyday life of both the Bear family in Peace at Last in 1980 and the Large family in Five Minutes’ Peace in 1986. They and their sequels have been go-to books for children and parents alike with their humorous interpretations of the trials of parenthood.

                    <span>Glasgow-based choreographer Mele Broomes’ intelligence stands out amid the cascade of online dance and circus offerings from this year’s festival
Watching recorded dance on your laptop at home couldn’t be further from the Edinburgh fringe experience: the buzz on the streets, the overload of shows, the odd venues and out-there experiences. But there’s still plenty that’s out there on the digital side. You can get your fix of, say, naked experimental circus, in Race Horse Company’s O’DD for example. It’s not wholly naked, I should say: later in the solo, Rauli Dahlberg’s body wrapped in clingfilm, flipping on a trampoline is rather mesmerising. 
There are more trampolines in a meditative quartet Ground Unplugged; four dancers on trampettes locked in a synchronised bounce. Or there’s Touchdown, a half-dance, half-physics lecture from Taiwan, in which Cheng Hao combines discussing the reckless and unpredictable nature of electrons with insomniac musings on the meaning of life, while seemingly peeling himself from the ceiling.

Opting for hydrogen that is made using fossil fuels rather than renewable electricity could create up to 8m tonnes of carbon emissions every year by 2050, according to an analysis of government data.
The figures show that the use of fossil-fuel hydrogen, or “blue hydrogen”, would create the same carbon emissions each year that more than a million petrol cars would produce, compared with using zero-carbon “green hydrogen”.

‘He is one of the best players in the world,’ says Spurs coach

Nuno Espírito Santo praised Harry Kane for helping Tottenham Hotspur to victory at Wolves in the striker’s first appearance of the season. With Kane’s future remaining uncertain as Manchester City contemplate whether to make another attempt to prise him from north London, the player came on as a 71st-minute substitute at Molineux, where Spurs won 1-0 thanks to an early penalty by Dele Alli.
Kane was applauded on to the pitch by the travelling fans, a gesture he reciprocated after the final whistle. “He did well, he helped the team,” said Nuno of the striker who could have marked his return with a goal but saw his shot saved by José Sá. “He is still in the process of improving his fitness. But he is one of the best players in the world. You can see he helped the team in possession.”

                    <span>The ex-Inbetweener’s new work-in-progress standup show, about breaking beyond being typecast, has a self-lacerating character
The maladroit comic parlaying their anxiety into humour is as old as standup itself. But it’s a highwire act: other people’s neuroses can be funny, or – one wrong step – troubling instead. Is it unfair to expect sure-footedness from Trying Not to Panic, the standup debut of ex-Inbetweener Joe Thomas? Perhaps – it’s a work-in-progress after all, like so many of the offerings on this year’s Edinburgh not-quite-the-fringe. Comedians have had few opportunities to hone their shows, or their craft, over the past 18 months. It’s not been the optimum period in which to launch a new set, much less a new standup career. (A difficulty with which fellow Inbetweener Simon Bird has also wrestled.)
So: the good news is that this is a striking debut from Thomas, here to lament his career stasis and how the Channel 4 sitcom for ever defines him in the public perception. And the less good news? Well, I’m not sure the show’s humour is sufficiently buoyant – yet – to lift audiences above Thomas’s pit of despair. Some of the gags are awfully cynical, and the self-lacerating character of the comedy left me uncertain whether to laugh with Thomas, or worry for him.

                    <span>Theatr Clywd, Mold
Letting the audience choose props and costumes adds both absurd and affecting possibilities to this selection of 15 new short plays
Directed by Theatr Clwyd’s artistic director, Tamara Harvey, Curtain Up is an appropriately celebratory title for the company’s three-week season of 15 new short plays by writers from Wales, performed by a cast of 30. For each of the three weeks, five plays are performed by 10 actors at each performance.
With each play at little over 10 minutes in length, it allows for swift and playful variations in dramatic tone and formal experimentation. In the first week’s plays, Samantha O’Rourke’s Finding Feet was a movingly heartfelt monologue of love at first sight, while in The Ongoing Eternal Search for “Da” by Mari Izzard, sexual tensions were inflamed to Nintendo sound effects.
The central conceit common in all of these dramatic vignettes is that each contains an unspecified significant object. These props are chosen by the audience at the beginning of each performance, as well as a costume, unknown to the performers. We are also invited to intervene in the casting of roles. The performance begins, and the five plays unfurl according to the audience’s interventions, in this case performed by the first week’s uniformly great cast.

                    <span>Readers despair at the Tory government’s treatment of the people who risked their lives to work for it in Afghanistan
You have to admire the genius of the UK’s refugee policy: first, no one who gets here unofficially can be considered for asylum and the only way to get here is by official routes – but there are no official routes in (UK to take 20,000 Afghan refugees over five years under resettlement plan, 17 August). And second, with the Afghan crisis, we are told by Whitehall that “we don’t want to do this on the basis of whoever can get themselves to Kabul airport over the course of the next week … that means most people will be coming via third countries”. And there is the genius of the approach: anyone coming via third countries will be told that they should claim asylum in the first one they come to, absolving the need for the UK to take any at all. Catch-22 made real.
And we have to endure boasts about the UK’s long record of welcoming refugees – one MP was heard bleating on BBC Radio 4 last week that Britain leads the world in taking people in. Lord Dubs was quoted in the same report as saying that if Canada can take in 20,000 refugees now, why can’t the UK do better than 20,000 over five years?

                    <span>Sue Miller and Sean Tompkins on the importance of retrofitting and reuse of materials in construction in order to reduce the UK’s carbon emissions
Your article on the importance of retrofit and reuse of buildings over new-build is most timely (Editorial, 18 August). As the planning bill makes its way through parliament this autumn, it could be amended to reflect the shocking disparity in carbon emissions that you highlight. Indeed, as the bill is likely to be debated while the UK hosts Cop26, it would seem perverse of the government not to take the opportunity to bring the planning system and construction industry into line with the Cop26 objectives. 
Sue Miller 
Liberal Democrat, House of Lords
• Changes to VAT rates on the refurbishment and repair of buildings are long overdue. There are nearly 30m buildings in the UK, and approximately 28m of these will need to be retrofitted by the end of 2050 to meet our net zero commitments. Given that the energy used to run our homes accounts for over a quarter of all CO2 emissions, there is an urgent need to do more.

United wiped the floor with Leeds last weekend but had to settle for a point here as Mason Greenwood equalised to extend their unbeaten away league run to 27 games, matching Arsenal’s top-flight record.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side were erratic and off-colour, teasing only patches of class for the noisy travelling fans. Southampton proved fiendish opponents, successfully shackling United’s glittering cast and could have earned victory on another day. For Solskjær, the warning signs were there long before Adams’ shot beat David de Gea, via a wicked deflection off Fred, with half an hour gone. “We lost our heads when they scored,” Solskjær said.

                    <span>Pair allegedly charged €150 for ‘ancestral’ ceremonies involving psychotropic substances
Spanish police have arrested a couple over accusations they were carrying out rituals – billed online as “international ancestral medicine” – involving an array of banned substances ranging from toad venom to ayahuasca.
The couple, aged 42 and 38, allegedly ran an association that performed ceremonies involving psychotropic substances for as much as €150 (£129) a session. Weekend retreats were also on offer at a cost of up to €350 (£300).

Sainsbury’s could be on the shopping list of private equity outfits as the race to buy Morrisons highlights the attractiveness of the big supermarket chains to investors.
Last week the buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) won the backing of the Morrisons board for its £7bn offer to buy the UK’s fourth largest supermarket chain. That bettered the £6.7bn already on the table from rival suitor Fortress.

Parts of state receive quarter of annual rainfall in a morning

Catastrophic flooding in Middle Tennessee left at least 10 people dead and dozens missing as record-shattering rainfall washed away homes and rural roads, authorities said.
Business owner Kansas Klein watched in horror from a bridge on Saturday morning as cars and entire houses were swept down a road in Waverly, a town of about 4,500 people that Klein, 48, has called home for more than half his life.

Northern leaders have reacted with dismay to further claims that HS2’s eastern leg to Leeds may be scrapped, while some “red wall” Tory MPs celebrated the mooted demise of a “hugely expensive white elephant”.
All summer, leaks from Whitehall have suggested the government is likely to ditch plans to extend the high-speed rail to Leeds. The latest, in the Sunday Mirror, quoted an anonymous source as saying that halting the eastern leg wouldsave £40bn and “there’s no way we’re going to see this built in our lifetimes”.

                    <span>From Neil Young to Keith Richards, a generation of musicians revered Phil and Don’s haunting music
• US music star Don Everly dies aged 84
Among the hundreds of hours of outtakes from the recording sessions that eventually became the Beatles’ Let It Be album, there is a version of Two of Us, taped on 25 January 1969. As John Lennon and Paul McCartney harmonise, the latter says to the former: “Take it, Phil”, a reference to Phil and Don Everly, the duo upon whom the pair had originally attempted to model themselves. On an early holiday, Lennon and McCartney attempted to impress local girls by telling them they had a band back home and they were “the British Everly Brothers”.
Shortly afterwards, the pair temporarily stopped working on the song entirely and began performing a ragged cover of Bye Bye Love instead. It’s both oddly sweet – a fleeting moment where the ill-tempered sessions actually achieved their aim of returning the Beatles to their roots – and oddly telling. At the end of a decade in which they had done more than anyone to alter rock music entirely, shifting its parameters until it was occasionally unrecognisable from the state in which it had started the 60s – and rendering the likes of Don and Phil Everly old news in the process – John Lennon and Paul McCartney still wanted to sound like the Everly Brothers. Throughout it all, McCartney later wrote, “their music echoed through my mind”.

                    <span>Any evaluation of the campaign must prioritise genuine investigation over reputation management
It was an extraordinary volte-face. On 7 August Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff and professional head of Britain’s military, wrote an op-ed on Afghanistan in the Times stating that it was too soon “to write off the country”. “There are increasing signs that the population is rallying in defiance,” he added. Eleven days later, after the Taliban had taken Afghanistan’s provincial capitals, followed by Kabul, and the Afghan army – raised by the west at a cost of $83bn – had melted away, Carter appeared on television. “You have to be very careful using the word enemy,” he told Sky News. “People need to understand who the Taliban actually are … They are bound together by a common purpose which is they don’t like corrupt governance … I do think that they have changed.” 
The general deserves some compassion. Like the rest of the leadership of Britain’s army, the post-9/11 wars defined his professional life. Carter commanded a brigade in Iraq in 2003-04 and later led a “regional command” in Afghanistan. His recent public pronouncements suggest an understandable desire not to undercut the sacrifices of his troops. Nonetheless, Carter’s dramatic pivot, combined – more bluntly – with the fact that he is still in post, underlines an important point. There is an urgent need within the British military now for a root and branch appraisal of why this has all happened. Yet, due to a variety of factors, both inside and outside the military, a full postmortem is unlikely.

Nicola Sturgeon has written to the embattled foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, urging him to intervene in the case of a Scottish Sikh man who has been imprisoned in India for nearly four years awaiting trial, and is facing the death penalty after a confession allegedly extracted under torture.
In Sturgeon’s first formal intervention on the case, seen exclusively by the Guardian, the first minister expresses the Scottish government’s “deep concerns” about Jagtar Singh Johal’s detention without trial – as well as his allegations of torture and mistreatment by Indian authorities while in custody.

After the lifting of most pandemic restrictions on the government’s 19 July “freedom day”, the long hard slog of Covid-19 was meant to be all over bar the shouting. Britain’s economic potential would be unleashed, allowing for the fastest growth since the second world war.

The hottest summer nights of my life were in Australia around the Christmas of 1988. My brother was on a gap year with a mate, working in a factory in Dandenong, a suburb of Melbourne. They were living in a tiny, scruffy caravan in an overgrown field when I went to visit. It had come with air-conditioning, they explained, but on their first night it shook violently for a few seconds upon being switched on, before dying.
The heat in this oven they called home was simply appalling. I slept not at all. But this was only the third-most terrible night of my life; the second-worst and the very worst were still a couple of weeks away.

When the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was published in early August, it confirmed what was already being made increasingly obvious by 2021’s extreme weather events: the burning of fossil fuels is “choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk”.
While the report’s main headlines weren’t news to many – especially climate scientists, who have been sounding the alarm for decades, and the fossil fuel industry, which has spent billions obscuring the truth about climate change – one cohort in the UK was mostly able to continue with their days unaware of its implications: young children.

                    <span>Exclusive: travellers let down by private providers are being forced to fall back on the taxpayer-funded NHS service

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

A Covid-19 testing company co-owned by a former Labour justice minister and a Labour councillor has been accused of failing to deliver kits and test results and not refunding customers, forcing them to fall back on the NHS.
RT Diagnostics is one of hundreds of firms that won government approval to sell PCR tests to travellers planning to enter England, after ministers decided to leave provision to the private sector, under a system that has drawn criticism over allegations of poor service against several companies.

Ali Jawad posted a picture of himself on a table top this weekend. Mask on, power shake to hand, Jawad’s arms were raised in celebration. The British powerlifter, who was born without legs and also deals with the debilitating effects of Crohn’s disease, had made it to the athletes’ village in Tokyo. “Arrived in the Paralympic village!! Absolutely amazing view from our rooms,” he wrote, adding a drooling emoji to reinforce the point.

The first time the Taliban took Kabul, 25 years ago they tortured and killed former President Mohammad Najibullah, dragged his body behind a truck through the streets, then hung it from a lamp-post.
Last week, with Kabul surrounded and a second victory almost inevitable, the Taliban ordered their troops to hold back from entering the city, to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. When they did march in, it was to a soundtrack of their commanders offering an “amnesty” for anyone who had opposed them over the last two decades.

A former defence minister has said the UK failed to “stand up” to the US over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, amid more questions about Dominic Raab’s holiday-induced absence last weekend.
Raab, the foreign secretary, has faced repeated demands to resign for remaining until Monday on a family holiday in Crete while the Afghan government collapsed, and delegating tasks to junior ministers.

An old party with an ageing membership, fronted by a politician with all the charisma of a middle-ranking bank clerk, following the humiliating descent from national institution to electoral also-rans already suffered by its comrades across Europe. The obituary of Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) had already been written.
Yet as Germany’s election campaign is about to enter its home stretch, it is the centre-left party of Olaf Scholz that is enjoying a surge of energy as its rivals start to lag.

                    <span>Season four of the drama based on Margaret Atwood’s novel has seen Elisabeth Moss’s June in near-constant peril. However, it seems her latent rage could be the thing that sets her free
I find myself wondering why I am still so invested in The Handmaid’s Tale on a weekly basis, as the camera slowly closes in on Elisabeth Moss’s face, her character June pained and broken by cruelty after cruelty. The apocalyptic drama is coming to the end of its fourth run, and when this season began, it found itself boxed into an inevitable corner. How could it sustain the story far beyond Margaret Atwood’s novel, without keeping its characters in a cage, and becoming an unrewarding display of relentless misery?
It had begun to go around in circles. June would defy the rules, escape the authorities, get captured, undergo torture, and then begin the whole cycle again. It made it hard for viewers to feel satisfaction in her victories. What was the point in rooting for her, if she would inevitably end up back at the start?

In San Francisco’s Sunset District, rows and rows of pastel-colored, two-storey homes flow from the edge of Golden Gate park into the sand dunes of Ocean Beach. Many houses here have solar panels on their roofs and compost bins at their driveways, flanked by hybrid and electric cars.
Yet here – and all over this city – one major solution to both the housing crisis and the climate crisis has been met with fierce resistance: building more.

Forty years ago a small group of women, along with a few men and children in buggies in tow, left their homes in Wales to protest against the arrival of US nuclear warheads at RAF Greenham Common. The steps they took that day would lead to the establishment of the Greenham women’s peace camp, which at its height gathered more than 70,000 women for direct action and became the biggest female-led protest since women’s suffrage.
Now hundreds more will march 130 miles to mark the 40th anniversary of the camp and call for the original women who led it to be remembered and respected as much as the suffragettes.

Channel 4’s successful decade-long mission to make the Paralympics a fixture on prime-time TV could be cast aside by a new owner if the government sells the state-owned broadcaster to the highest bidder, according to a former chairman and chief executive.
Channel 4 plans to broadcast a record 1,300 hours of coverage of the Tokyo Games, almost three times the amount the BBC managed with its Olympic coverage, cementing its place as the world’s leading Paralympic broadcaster.

                    <span>A winning way with short-season figs, and a crunchy, herby, baked fish treat
This is the most extraordinary summer I can remember. The day on which monsoon-style rains smashed my tomato plants to rags was followed by one so hot and dry I could barely find the energy to toss a salad. This is the future I guess, when those of us who like to cook not only seasonally but also for the weather will be kept on their toes. (Last week we went from eating tomato salad in the garden to wanting pie and mashed potatoes by the fire in the space of 24 hours.) I am getting used to planning no further ahead than my next meal. A certain spontaneity is required if we are to cook in tune with this crazy, unpredictable weather.
There was a tray of sardines at the fishmonger’s the other day – silver, black and gold with eyes as bright as jewels. An all too rare sighting of a seasonal fish I first met as a kid, tucked up in golden tins of tomato sauce that you opened with a little metal key. Then we ate them on toast for tea.

Ed Balls is unhappy about the mess. They say you can judge a cook by how he cleans and Britain’s one-time education minister, shadow chancellor of the exchequer and most popular Gangnam Style tribute act is surrounded by broken shells, tiramisu, pasta sauce, soup and – to his mind most offensively – runny custard in a hard pastry base. There are Le Creusets and frying pans and bowls and sieves, the detritus of any self-respecting cookery photoshoot.
“It’s very upsetting,” Balls, 54, protests, brandishing a creamy whisk. “I’m a clean-as-you-go chef. I don’t want people to get the wrong idea. This is more like Yvette’s kitchen,” he adds, throwing his wife, Yvette Cooper MP, under the slovenly bus. “She’s like a snail, you can see wherever she’s been. It’s one of the reasons she doesn’t cook. At a certain point I just decided it was easier for me to do it.”

Tucked into the foothills of northern Spain, the village of Trasmoz attracts thousands of tourists each year. For many, the allure is not its half-ruined castle nor stunning mountain backdrop but rather a curious quirk of history: Trasmoz is Spain’s only excommunicated and cursed village.
“So far, being excommunicated and cursed hasn’t been bad for us,” said Lola Ruiz Diaz, one of the 47 or so people who live all year round in Trasmoz, some 50 miles north-west of Zaragoza. “It’s turned out to be a point in our favour.”

                    <span>The foreign secretary was in good company in woefully misjudging the Taliban threat
Many of the excitable characters who impulsively phone talk radio stations without having thought through their contradictory positions are rightly horrified by footage of desperate people falling off planes into the chaotic inferno of hate of Biden and Johnson’s bodged British and American withdrawal from Afghanistan. Others, explaining that Brexit was about stopping refugees and immigration, want everyone there to be left to die, as sorting out the mess we have made is apparently not our business. Admittedly, I have the same attitude to the toilet bowl after an ill-advised lamb phaal, but I am just a 53-year-old “so-called” comedian, not an elected leader of the free world with blood on his hands.
On Wednesday, I drove distractedly across England listening to a baffling prime minister’s questions. Various politicians, trying to read the fickle electorate’s current position on the hate/compassion mood board, swinging again like it did after the death of little Alan Kurdi, explained how welcoming Britain has always been to refugees. I stopped to eat an artisanal steak pie at the Rollright Stones and wondered how our legendarily welcoming nature squared with the government’s new nationality and borders bill, which aims to criminalise anyone who attempts to seek asylum and anyone who attempts to help anyone seeking asylum. Even lifeboat men and women risking their lives to dredge dying children from the Channel could be criminals it seems, the horrible bastards. A fake Home Office website called Migrants on the Move, like the fake Conservative Campaign HQ factcheckUK site Dominic Raab defended during the last election, even purports to offer objective but deliberately discouraging advice to would-be Britons. Who even knew that the UK was full of venomous hamsters and that, in Kent, human hair is illegal?

Nordelta is Argentina’s most well-known gated community: an enclave of spacious homes for the rich amid a dreamy landscape of lakes and streams north of Buenos Aires.
But environmentalists question its very existence because it is built on the wetlands of the Paraná, the second most important river in South America after the Amazon.

                    <span>According to addiction expert Dr Anna Lembke, our smartphones are making us dopamine junkies, with each swipe, like and tweet feeding our habit. So how do we beat our digital dependency?
Dr Anna Lembke, a world-leading expert on addiction, is concerned about my “phone problem”. During our interview I confess, in passing, to having an unhealthy attachment to my iPhone, checking it every few minutes like a compulsive tic (sound familiar?) Lembke is having none of it. She wants me to abstain from using it for at least 24 hours by locking it in a drawer and going out. The first 12 hours will be filled with anxiety and Fomo, but as time unfolds, I’ll experience a sense of “real freedom”, will gain insight into my relationship with my digital companion and will “resolve to get back to using it a little differently”, she says, speaking with a soothing yet firm tone.
I’d do well to heed her advice. As the chief of Stanford University’s dual diagnosis addiction clinic (which caters to people with more than one disorder), Lembke has spent the past 25-plus years treating patients addicted to everything from heroin, gambling and sex to video games, Botox and ice baths. The bespectacled 53-year-old psychiatrist has written an influential book about the prescription-drug epidemic, delivered Ted Talks on America’s opioid crisis and appeared as a talking head in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma to discuss the drug that is social media. She’s a whiz on why we get hooked on things – and how we can enjoy pleasurable things in healthier doses.

Being in someone’s else’s house when they are not there (and you’re not a burglar) is a contemplative experience, like walking round a film set. It may be people that make a home, but an empty home, that once held people, still holds something. I’m in my mother’s house and she’s not here, because she’s away and even though I’ve been here a hundred times since I left home, this time it feels different. I fill the sink with cups that I only wash on a need-to-use basis, and I eat chicken fillets and berries, like a forager with access to a deli counter. I live like this for days. I visit the dentist and then my old friend, Andrea, picks me up and feeds me pizza and the most glorious five-ingredient (chocolate, eggs, sugar, butter and flour) Claudia Roden torta di cioccolato from Roden’s The Food of Italy, which I urge you to buy and try.

Depending on where you look on social media, making money seems to be straightforward. Learning how to buy a property in the UK with no money, or getting the basics of being a day trader in 30 minutes, are both lessons on YouTube, along with a plethora of advice on how to earn from cryptocurrency. Meanwhile “finfluencers”, with varying degrees of knowledge, have blossomed on Instagram and TikTok.
But the standard of advice varies widely from grounded, sage information on how to invest, to unregulated personalities offering shallow quick takes without fully setting out the pitfalls of what might happen to your money.

Last July, Filippo Mancini, a fourth-generation ice-cream maker, ran the Belly Banger competition from his shop on the esplanade at Prestwick beach in Ayrshire.
Punters paid £7.50 for 12 scoops – “whatever flavours you wanted, a wee biscuit in the top and some cream”. They had 15 minutes to eat them. If they managed it they got a certificate and their money back. Mancini, who says about a dozen people succeeded, plans to run the competition again this September.

                    <span>Having suffered a 90% drop in population, they still face extinction in Britain – but a new initiative offers a glimmer of hope
A hundred and fifty water voles were last week settling into new homes on the riverbanks of Hertfordshire. The animals had been released from pens the previous week as part of a campaign to halt the devastating drop in Arvicola amphibius number across the British Isles over the past 50 years.
Once widespread in the UK, water voles – whose most known incarnation is Ratty in Wind in the Willows – have suffered a 90% drop in population since the 1970s. Feral mink, which kill young voles in their nests, in combination with major changes in land use, have resulted in the widespread eradication of a species that was once a ubiquitous presence along the banks of Britain’s rivers.

                    <span>Allowing yourself to daydream about the perfect home is one thing, but the romance is spoiled as soon as you open the door on to real world
My friend is trying to buy a flat in Bristol, and each time he sends me a link with a little question mark, I get a complicated rush. Looking at property websites has been an anti-pleasure of mine for many years now, and sometimes I browse as meditation, other times masochism, often as a sorbet-like palate cleanser before paddling into a crisis.
But this week the flat he was viewing had an oddness to it and it took a minute for me to work out what was wrong. I realised, with unsurprised shock, that the furniture was not of human size. The rooms had been staged – with a chest of drawers the width of a shelf, a single bed had been made up with two pillows to appear as a double, and so on – with a certain poetry. The decoration was to nobody’s taste, which I respect – pastel velvet cushions, many small and sharp-angled mirrors, a wide-backed chair masquerading as a sofa, a cheese plant instead of a wardrobe. The flat was furnished for an unhappy couple seen from a distance and still he was outbid, which is good because it means I can carry on looking.

British capitalism seems to be on a roll. A million job vacancies were advertised in July, a new monthly record. Early signs are that unwinding the furlough scheme, now under way, is not going to cause a sharp rise in unemployment.
House prices are rising at the fastest rate since 2004. Public borrowing in July halved compared with last July. Many new companies are being created. Business confidence is rising. The recovery is moving so fast as threats of lockdown recede that the UK on average will get back to pre-pandemic levels of output before the year is out. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, can indulge his boss’s tantrums; his political position could hardly be stronger.

                    <span>The Oscar-winning film-maker’s image, shot on a vintage train in Germany, features in a new book of his off-duty documentary photography
Long before he was a cinematographer, Roger Deakins was a photographer. The film-maker’s eye that has earned Deakins 15 Oscar nominations (and two Oscars) in celebrated work with the Coen brothers, Sam Mendes and others first found its expression in documentary photography of rural north Devon in the early 1970s.
Some of those formative pictures of farm hands and country fairs are collected in the first monograph of Deakin’s photography work. They take their place alongside images such as this one, which was taken on the set of The Reader, the film of Bernhard Schlink’s Holocaust novel, made in Germany in 2007. Although Deakins says he often used a still camera to take photographs of locations or to plan lighting rigs for particular scenes, occasionally, off duty and off set, he returned to his first vocation, just looking for little moments that captured his attention.

“I’ve got to get on with it and I will. It’s the way I’ve been brought up. Nothing has come to me easily,” McDermott said. “I’m not frightened of taking it on and also, as we’ve seen, there are a lot of former players in a worse state than me.

It is credited with preventing the worst global recession since at least the second world war from turning into something far worse. But after the injection of trillions of dollars into financial markets to cushion the blow from Covid-19, the era of quantitative easing could be coming to an end.
This week, attention will turn to the gathering of central bank chiefs in Jackson Hole for clues about how the US Federal Reserve plans to bring its vast QE bond-buying programme to an eventual halt after more than a year of emergency stimulus.

Israeli aircraft struck Hamas sites in Gaza late on Saturday, the military said, in an escalation of hostilities after earlier cross-border gunfire seriously injured an Israeli soldier and wounded 41 Palestinians, including two critically.
The injuries came during a Gaza protest organised by the enclave’s Islamist rulers, Hamas, and other factions in support of Jerusalem, where Palestinian clashes with Israeli police helped spark an 11-day Israel-Hamas conflict in May.

Afghanistan is facing an “absolute catastrophe” involving widespread hunger, homelessness and economic collapse unless an urgent humanitarian effort is agreed in the wake of the US withdrawal, world leaders are warned today.
With growing anger over Britain’s chaotic evacuation effort and people killed in a crush around Kabul airport yesterday, a meeting of G7 leaders has been hastily arranged for early this week. Senior figures in Kabul warned that the latest chaos is combining with drought, huge displacements of people and economic paralysis to create a disaster requiring immediate international action.

Even Jorginho finds the idea that he could win the Ballon d’Or this year hard to accept. He did not take it as an insult when he heard Antonio Cassano, the former Italy striker, say that any journalist who votes for the Chelsea midfielder “should have his licence taken away”.
Instead of picking a fight with Cassano after finding him on an Italian beach earlier this summer, Jorginho found common ground with the 39-year-old, agreeing that it would be a scandal if he takes the Ballon d’Or off Lionel Messi. “Now I admire Jorginho even more,” Cassano said last week. “We were talking for a good 90 minutes. He is an exceptional guy: very intelligent, humble and polite.”

Manager praises duo ‘brave enough to step up for their country’

The celebrated leader Ole Gunnar Solskjær channels most often is Alex Ferguson, not Theodore Roosevelt, but even as he seeks to borrow from his mentor’s blueprint, the Manchester United manager turned to a past US president to argue Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford should be spared the sort of vitriolic reception that greeted David Beckham after the 1998 World Cup.
While Rashford is sidelined by a shoulder injury, Sancho, another to miss a penalty in England’s fateful Euro 2020 final shootout, could make his first appearance on enemy territory at St Mary’s on Sunday.

They didn’t wait long to make it right. A few hours after their women’s side missed out on becoming the Hundred’s first champions, Southern Brave punched through Birmingham Phoenix’s heavyweight batting line-up to win their own final by 32 runs.
Paul Stirling’s 61 from 36 for the Brave was the game’s top score, with Ross Whiteley’s 44 off 19 adding a big finish. But could James Vince’s unrelenting roster of bowlers tame Phoenix’s merciless big-hitting?

The agency set up to investigate alleged war crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan is unlikely to be able to send investigators to the Taliban-led country for some time. 
Experts have described the fall of Afghanistan’s government as a setback to potential evidence-gathering activities stemming from the Brereton report, even though it is possible the Taliban would be receptive to such investigations.

Everybody wants their own Pep Guardiola. Everybody wants to find a former player, steeped in the traditions of the club, who can bring great success, preferably by using products of the academy. But the problem with geniuses is that there aren’t many of them about.
It’s also the problem of clubs: for all the talk of identities and DNA, very few of them actually have a cogent philosophy that binds first team to youth sides, or at least not one that has been in place for long enough to turn out a player who can return almost two decades after their debut to find an academy still turning out players shaped by the same prevailing idea.

Pep Guardiola challenged Jack Grealish to copy Raheem Sterling and become as prolific as his new teammate after he opened his Manchester City account on his home debut.
Grealish became the first £100m player to score in the Premier League when he kneed in City’s second goal in a 5-0 thrashing of Norwich, getting the champions a belated first win after losing to Leicester in the Community Shield and then Tottenham last week.

                    <span>Admitting cowardice is a subversive act within cultures that demand lip service
Most of us aren’t brave. We wouldn’t protest in the streets of Kabul as armed and triumphant clerical reactionaries fingered their guns. I am hardly breaking news when I say that fear makes us keep our heads down and conform. But how we conform makes a world of difference. Oppressive regimes, organisations and political cultures insist that we pretend to go along with them willingly. On occasion, the most courageous way to fight them is simply to admit we are afraid.
Outside abusive personal relationships, fear produces sycophantic subservience in two areas that dominate life in otherwise safe and democratic countries. In most workplaces, managers allow little or no free discussion or criticism. The cases of dictatorial power that have become famous are when managerial megalomania has led corporations to disaster – Enron, for instance, or NatWest. But anyone who looks honestly at their working lives will accept that in many hierarchies most of the time men and women in superior positions demand subservience and, like absolute monarchs, are shocked when they do not receive it.

Anna Nordqvist and Nanna Koerstz Madsen share lead

The final major of 2021 may deliver the most extraordinary story of all. In among the big names on a gloriously tight leaderboard at the Women’s Open sits Louise Duncan, the 21-year-old amateur champion. The only time Duncan had cause to frown on day three here was when she was reminded she is not eligible for the £640,000 bounty on offer to any professional winner. “Thanks for that,” said Duncan, a University of Stirling student. “I could be drowning my sorrows tomorrow, tears rolling down my face.”
Imagine being so tantalisingly close to such riches one cannot claim.

A murder investigation has been launched after a man was stabbed to death in south-west London. The 22-year-old was found after police were called out at 3.45am on Saturday to reports of a disturbance in Clarence Street, Kingston.
The Metropolitan police said a 19-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and possession of an offensive weapon, while an 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both men are in custody at a south London police station.

                    <span>The former health secretary and acclaimed memoirist on his rock’n’roll past, how the Litvinenko poisoning inspired his new thriller, and how he’d have handled Covid
Alan Johnson grew up in working-class Notting Hill, London, in the 1950s, raised by his teenage sister after their mother’s death. He left school at 15 and worked as a postman, a union leader and a Labour MP and cabinet minister under Tony Blair. The spry author of four award-winning memoirs, retirement is not his style. He left politics in 2017 and now, at 71, is publishing his first work of fiction – a thriller – The Late Train to Gipsy Hill.
I gather you wanted to be a writer before you ever thought of becoming a politician?
When the Beatles’ Paperback Writer came out in 1966, I wanted to be a paperback writer. I’ve dedicated The Late Train to Gipsy Hill to my amazing English teacher ­– Peter Carlin. He had natural authority, a mellifluous voice and never went anywhere near the cane. I not only admired him, he was the first teacher I liked. He treated us as adults. I submitted short detective stories to him: Inspector Andrew and Mr Midnight. Mr Carlin said: “Alan, have you ever thought of sending these off?” When I got the inevitable rejections, he said: “Don’t give up. All great writers could paper their walls with rejection slips.” I sent him a facsimile of the book’s dedication for his 90th birthday.

A sex swing inspired by the floating palace hotel in Udaipur – it was what Swansea had been calling out for,” says Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen over the phone, the morning after last week’s debut episode of the long-awaited Changing Rooms reboot sashayed back to our screens. Its return, after a 17-year hiatus, comes on Channel 4 rather than its original BBC home.
Llewelyn-Bowen transformed an almost entirely beige living room into a peacock and flamingo-inspired space with shell chandeliers and suspended seat. It was, as it happened, what these Swansea residents wanted – and it is also one of the most talked-about programmes of the summer.

A preventative measure, the move would enable policymakers and affected populations to be more prepared for what are being described by experts as “silent killers.”

Some economic effects of the coronavirus are obvious. Pre-pandemic, the share of retail sales conducted online had taken around eight years to go from 10% to 20%, but then in nine months shot up to 36% in January 2021.
But perhaps more surprising was a recent dramatic headline from Bloomberg: “UK Wage Growth Hits a Record as Vacancies Pass 1 Million”. This was based on estimates from the Office for National Statistics’ monthly wages and salaries survey that average regular pay had increased by 7.4% over the past year. So why should we be cautious in interpreting this huge rise?

Coronavirus – latest updates

The Covid Delta variant has swept across south-east Asia over recent months, prompting lockdowns and overwhelming hospitals – from Malaysia to Thailand and Indonesia. Now the impact is being felt in the Philippines, just as the country’s chronic lack of health workers reaches a crisis point.
“The disease has become very aggressive,” said Michael Bilan, who works on a Covid ward in Manila. This time, patients tend to require a higher amount of oxygen, for longer, he said. The number of Covid patients is also at a record high: last week, 277 were receiving treatment. New wards have been opened to meet demand.

                    <span>The professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience discusses his work to develop a scientific explanation for how the brain conjures consciousness
For centuries, philosophers have theorised about the mind-body question, debating the relationship between the physical matter of the brain and the conscious mental activity it somehow creates. Even with advances in neuroscience and brain imaging techniques, large parts of that fundamental relationship remain stubbornly mysterious. It was with good reason that, in 1995, the cognitive scientist David Chalmers coined the term “the hard problem” to describe the question of exactly how our brains conjure subjective conscious experience. Some philosophers continue to insist that mind is inherently distinct from matter. Advances in understanding how the brain functions undermine those ideas of dualism, however.
Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, is at the leading edge of that latter research. His Ted talk on consciousness has been viewed more than 11m times. His new book, Being You, proposes an idea of the human mind as a “highly evolved prediction machine”, rooted in the functions of the body and “constantly hallucinating the world and the self” to create reality.

                    <span>Writing a diary is a great way to offload – and, if memory fails, it’s a wonderful window on the past
I still get funny looks from people when I mention that I keep a diary. Maybe the practice strikes them as shifty or weirdly old-fashioned. It’s true that I never feel more furtive than when my wife finds me writing it at our kitchen table – it’s like being spotted entering a confessional box in church. What exactly have I got to tell this black book about a life that we share all day, every day? What secrets can I possibly be keeping?
The answer: nothing of any great note, and yet so much of my life is in it. I started writing a journal (as I used to call it) when I went on holiday. Twenty years ago I decided to go full-time and since then I’ve kept it more or less every day. Why? I suppose it began as an experiment – and became an obligation. You can’t hold back time, but you can try to save the past from being completely erased. It often feels trivial to record things as they happen (a stray remark, hearing a song, fleeting moments of doom or delight), but later they may prove useful, or instructive, or amusing. It also maintains the illusion of diligence – that you’re not just pissing away the days. A diary is good exercise for the writing muscle, the way a pianist practises scales or a footballer does keepy-uppies. During lockdown, like everyone else, I got into routines that felt numbing in their repetition and diary-wise left me short of material. I took recourse to discussing the books and box sets I was involved with – not exactly Pepysian, but it got me through.

Joan Bennett may not be a Hollywood name that readily trips off the tongue. Blame an incident in 1951, when the man she was with, her agent and lover, Jennings Lang, got shot twice – once directly in the groin. Before it, Joan was a pioneering film-noir femme fatale, star of the films of Fritz Lang. She’d also just played Liz Taylor’s mother in Father of the Bride, and was building a career in TV. After the shooting, her career collapsed, never to fully recover. Lang’s attacker continued his career much like before. He was the film producer Walter Wanger, Bennett’s husband, to whom she would stay married for the next 14 years.

Thames Valley police said the woman was raped in a layby on the A4 in Thatcham, Berkshire, opposite the junction with Cox’s Lane, in an attack late on 16 August.

                    <span>The ‘forever war’ has finished with a debacle. If this marks the end of American interventionism, what will take its place?
A few months ago there were US bases all over Afghanistan where you could immerse yourself in Americana, buy Coke and Snickers bars from vending machines and watch live sport on TV.
Now the outpost has shrunk to one side of Kabul airport, a chaotic remnant of a 20-year stay where rearguard troops are trying to salvage the last scraps of dignity and honour, seemingly tossed aside by the political leadership in Washington, by trying to extract American stragglers and Afghan allies. Those allies, once inspired by talk of democracy, women’s rights and the free press, are now faced with the awful life-and-death dilemmas of preserving evidence of their work for or with the US-led coalition, in the hope of last-minute salvation, or destroying it, in a bid to escape execution.

                    <span>Biden’s Afghan chaos means Europe can no longer rely on him. Let’s hope a more balanced security relationship emerges
The North Atlantic measurably widened last week. The more Joe Biden tried to shift blame for the Afghan chaos, the bigger the gulf with America’s UK and European allies grew. This US president, who preaches the virtues of multilateralism yet acted on his own, has done more in a few weeks to undermine the western alliance than Donald Trump ever did with all his bluster.

                    <span>(The Last Music Co)
The late bandleader’s 70-year career packed in restless shifts of style, virtuoso skill and guest spots from jazz’s best
When Chris Barber died, aged 90, in March, he had only recently retired after leading a band for 70 years. You can’t celebrate that with an album and a few notes, especially with music as popular and wide-ranging as his. So what we have here is a package of four CDs and a book tracing Barber’s career as one track follows another. With its leader playing trombone, and occasionally double bass, Chris Barber’s Jazz Band combined New Orleans-style traditional jazz with whatever else caught his fancy. The results were sometimes quite spectacular.
The eighth of these 69 tracks, from 1956, has the band’s banjo player, Lonnie Donegan, singing Rock Island Line with bass and washboard accompaniment. It sparked a nationwide craze for amateur skiffle groups, without which there would have been no Beatles. Unlike other trad bands, Barber’s never got stuck in a rut. Every record, every tour was a fresh start. As the tracks roll on we hear blues, gospel, ragtime and guest stars such as Louis Jordan, Joe Harriott, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Dr John, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. One late recording, from 2010, features a lively Jools Holland.

                    <span>Renovating this old workhouse is a chance to let a designer’s imagination run free
As Victorian workhouses go, St Clement’s in Bow, east London, is unexpectedly beautiful. A grand ode to Italianate architecture, the building, which was also a former psychiatric hospital, is relishing its newfound revival as affordable housing, part of a regeneration project by the Greater London Authority. Just metres from the chaos and traffic of Mile End Road, the elegant courtyard and grounds of St Clement’s offer a hushed reverence to those living in this vast Grade II listed slice of 19th-century architecture and the sense of community is palpable.
Inside a ground-floor flat, sunlight floods across the sitting room of Tom Bax and his partner Dr Richard Cole, lighting up the bright hues that are painted on each arched window frame. Sculptural lighting, fitting for the elevation of these 19th-century rooms and a rich colourful narrative is interwoven throughout.

                    <span>Stockton-on-Tees is leading a radical rethink of our urban centres, which is now even more urgent as Covid takes its toll
A few months before the pandemic struck, Nigel Cooke found himself under incredulous interrogation at a Local Government Association get-together in Loughborough. As the Stockton-on-Tees councillor responsible for regeneration, it had been Cooke’s call to buy up a vast shopping centre that has dominated the town’s high street since the 1970s.
“Word had got round that we’d bought a shopping centre that had come on the market,” says Cooke. “The gist of the response from fellow councillors was: ‘Are you mad? There’s no future in shopping centres’. I said: ‘We’ve not bought it to run as a shopping centre. We’ve bought it to knock it down’. They said: ‘You’re even madder than we thought’. No one had thought of doing what we’re doing.”

                    <span>The road to Tokyo has been hard but the British wheelchair racer is confident she can add to her five Paralympic gold medals
Hannah Cockroft prepared for the Tokyo Paralympics in the best way she knows how: breaking world records. “Wait a minute …” she says, trying to pull together her performances at the World Para Athletics grand prix in Switzerland. “… so across the four I broke the 100, 200, 400 and 800. But over the four I broke them seven times.”
Cockroft has consistently been setting the bar ever higher since she announced herself to the world at the 2012 Paralympics. After the London Games she went seven years unbeaten in the four distances she competes at the T34 wheelchair category, winning five Paralympic gold medals. That solitary defeat, to her British teammate Kare Adenegan in 2019, caused her to rethink her approach and launch another period of dominance on the track. To call her a natural-born competitor may be underselling it.

                    <span>With Afghan citizens’ data now in the hands of the Taliban, assumptions about controls that check misuse of intelligence are wide of the mark
In the summer of 2013, shortly after Edward Snowden’s revelations about the surveillance capabilities of the American National Security Agency (NSA) began to appear, I had a private conversation with a former cabinet minister about the implications of the leaks. At one stage, I mentioned to him a remark attributed to a prime architect of some of the NSA systems – that they had taken the US to “a keystroke away from totalitarianism”. The MP scoffed at the idea. What I needed to remember, he told me, in that superior tone that toffs adopt when speaking to their gardeners, was that the US and the UK were “mature democracies”. In such polities, the chances of anyone coming to power who might have the inclination to use such power for sinister purposes was, he said, zero.
Three years later, the US elected Donald Trump. Five years after Trump, look around: an increasing number of democracies are now run by autocrats of various stripes. Think of Orbán in Hungary, the Law and Justice party in Poland, Duterte in the Philippines, Erdoğan in Turkey, Modi in India, Bolsonaro in Brazil and others in Latin America. None of these autocrats has any scruples about using intelligence collected by state agencies against critics, dissidents and potential opponents. In fact, they positively relish being just a keystroke away from totalitarian control.

In a Politburo group study session on 23 November 2015, China’s president, Xi Jinping, recommended the book Capital in the Twenty-First Century by the French economist Thomas Piketty. “The rich data he used demonstrated that … unrestrained capitalism accelerates wealth inequality … [His] conclusion is worth us pondering on.”
Back then, Piketty’s work on inequality was reported all over the world and sparked soul-searching among elites from Wall Street to Main Street. Some were surprised that Xi was paying attention, too.

In the same week that this interview emerged, Craig topped Variety’s list of movie star salaries, reportedly earning $100m following the sale of two sequels to the highly enjoyable mystery Knives Out, which leaves a lot of giving away to do.

                    <span>Director Michael Sarnoski promises a revenge thriller but delivers something much quieter and more profound
A truffle-hunting pig has been kidnapped. Her grizzled owner, Rob (Nicolas Cage), abandons a quiet, off-grid life in the woods and sets out on a recovery mission, chauffeured by a yuppie-ish truffle buyer named Amir (Hereditary’s Alex Wolff, dressed in pale blue linen and a flashy Gucci belt). It is soon revealed that Rob is a former superstar chef.
Forget the title: this film isn’t really about a pig. Instead, it’s an understated indie drama more interested in nostalgia, daddy issues and the restaurant industry in Portland, Oregon. Co-writer and director Michael Sarnoski has an eye for unadorned natural beauty, and Patrick Scola’s sensual cinematography celebrates the golden light that streams through a kitchen window and the textures of the Pacific north-west’s autumn foliage. It appears Sarnoski values no-frills authenticity on the plate too, having Rob unleash a haughty diatribe against the pretensions of molecular gastronomy over a dish of scallops “bathed in the smoke of Douglas fir cones”.

We grew up without money: two rooms and an outside loo. I remember shyly cowering behind the coal shed as Mum tried to photograph me, but by the age of four I was playing Mia Farrow’s daughter in The Great Gatsby. I loved the fantasy of acting, the contrast of the worlds in which I lived. It’s not that one was better, but going from life with not very much to this extravagant, surreal set opened my eyes to possibilities.
Dad was charming and a genius with numbers – he was also deep in the organised crime world. In the 60s, he worked with both the Kray twins (Reggie was my brother’s Godfather) and their arch enemies, the Richardsons. He went to prison quite a few times and Mum would never take us to visit him. Still, he was my dad who I loved deeply.

A government extremism adviser has admitted during a private meeting that it is wrong to label Extinction Rebellion (XR) supporters as “extreme”, despite the home secretary, Priti Patel, condemning the group as “criminals” who threaten the nation’s way of life.
John Woodcock, the former Labour MP who was asked by the Home Office this year to examine disruption and violence by extreme political groups, sought to reassure XR activists that he did not regard the movement as uniformly extreme during a Zoom video conference call last month. “You’re worried that I want to label everyone who supports XR as extremists and that is certainly not the case,” he said.

                    <span>The lessons top athletes are learning about stress and mental health can help us handle pressure in our own lives
It was going to be the Pandemic Olympics; the cheerless games that would inspire ambivalence at best. And then sport did its thing. Despite the lack of crowds and the looming threat of Covid, Tokyo was amazing. It also became something else: the mental health Olympics.
When Simone Biles pulled out of the gymnastics events, she brought an unprecedented focus on the psychological challenges of elite sport. One of the greatest athletes of all time had decided to prioritise her mind over the will – and enormous pressure – to win. “There is more to life than just gymnastics,” she said. After taking stock in a Tokyo gym, she returned to the beam event, taking a bronze medal in what might have felt like one of her biggest victories.

A former tour manager for R Kelly testified on Friday that he paid a $500 bribe to a government worker to get the singer Aaliyah a fake identification card so Kelly could secretly marry her when she was 15 years old.

However, those thinking about signing up need to be prepared to accept some risk to their cash. This is a lot riskier than a bank or building society savings account.

                    <span>Original viewers of the soapy drama may be horrified to see it has been revived with a new set of privileged teens – but at least it’s still entertaining
If you wanted to launch an overt attack on 30-year-olds, I could think of little better than rebooting Gossip Girl (Wednesday 25 August, 10.35pm, BBC One; all episodes on iPlayer), a series that ran for five years between 2007 and 2012, made stars of Blake Lively, Penn Badgley and Leighton Meester, and introduced an entire generation to the concept of typing something mean very quickly on a BlackBerry. The screaming, crying, skull-cracking sound you can hear in the distance is a generation of original viewers – “But, hold on, they are remaking Gossip Girl? The series of my youth? They are remaking it because … 14 years have gone by? Meaning I am no longer … young?” – going through a profound existential crisis. If they can find time to, anyway, between planning their weddings or doing mortgage calculations on Santander’s website.

                    <span>Bromley, Kent: How we look at nature is very important. So I decided to look twice at this strange tree
Nature often shows that life and death are intertwined, and I have learned that what is important is how we perceive this. I went for a walk to my local woods. I loved the warm hug of the sun, the smell of refreshing rain-dampened grass and the soothing melodies of the birds. In that moment I was at peace, filled with a feeling of pure happiness and calm. Then I stumbled across a tree in the open field. It made me stop and think. I felt joy and sadness, because half of it was full of life and half was lifeless.
I stared and marvelled at how the tree could balance both life and death, yet still look so beautiful and serene. This made me realise how life and death coexist and that I had a choice to make on how I perceived this scene before me. Taking a deep breath, I looked at the tree again. This time I saw beauty throughout. On one side, the luscious leaves protected a bird’s nest. But also, the dead branches were serving as a perch for birds, and the hollow trunk was a shelter for small animals and a multitude of insects such as beetles. I saw positivity. What do you see?

                    <span>Traditionally, scrub has been allowed to swamp England and Wales’s sand dunes, but now they are being set free
A few dark clouds, remnants of the storm that whipped up the North Sea the night before, still hang in the big Lincolnshire skies, above a coastline famed for its kiss-me-quick holiday towns such as Skegness and Mablethorpe. But push on north towards Cleethorpes and the mouth of the Humber, past the caravan parks and imposing sea walls, and the shoreline becomes much wilder, a mix of mud flats and salt marshes, backed by a wide expanse of sand dunes frequented by a few hardy dog walkers.
This is the eastern outpost of Dynamic Dunescapes, a £10m project supported by Natural England and conservation groups including Plantlife and the Wildlife Trusts, which aims to bring new life to sand dunes, with a radical approach to their management.

The Taliban’s sweeping advance last week has sparked fears that Europe could face a migration crisis similar to that in 2015, with people fleeing persecution or further conflict.

Valmeyer was a small commuter town made up of mostly middle-class families who worked in nearby St Louis, Missouri. Almost overnight, the community became a model of what it means to become climate resilient.

Waking up in a mental institution is a strange experience made slightly more bearable by the drugs administered the night before arrival. It’s an odd sensation to come round on a ward – in my case, one at the Hollymoor psychiatric hospital in Birmingham – and not recognise your own body. It took a while for my hands, feet and legs to understand that they were attached to my body. I just lay there for an hour trying to make sense of what was going on. I knew I was awake and alive, but that was as much as I could make out. I wriggled my fingers and toes repeatedly to be sure they hadn’t be…</span>

I went to a wedding at the weekend. That shouldn’t be a remarkable statement, but of course it is. It’s been a strange summer: the promise of normal life returning hasn’t quite materialised. Instead it has felt tentative, cautious. So I wasn’t sure how this big social event would feel. There was no cap on numbers, no social distancing, no miserable insistence on everything being outside, despite the season’s atrocious weather. It was a proper wedding, in the old style. And it was wonderful.
After 18 months of deprivation, I forgot what it was like to feel part of a community. Robbed of really celebrating these major life milestones – birthdays and anniversaries, births and christenings, weddings and funerals – life has felt atomised and dreary. That sense of connection you get from being around other human beings, including those you don’t know well, has been absent. So a huge, unapologetic, exuberant wedding was always going to be quite the experience.

                    <span>There are plenty of tourists, but UK hospitality firms are plagued by labour shortages this summer
For Lynton, a small village perched on a picturesque hill overlooking the north Devon coast, this year’s summer tourist season has been exceptional. Holidaymakers from all over the UK have descended in huge numbers, arriving by coach, by car and on foot.
The scenes are perhaps unsurprising, given how many households have decided against international travel this year when faced with the expense and uncertainty of Covid rules. In July, the Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that an extra £30.5bn and 300,000 jobs would be injected into British travel and hospitality sectors if tourists across Europe switched foreign holidays for domestic ones – with Devon one of the biggest recipients of this shift.

Jesy Nelson is having her photo taken. For the first time in her career, it’s all about her. She is no longer one quarter of the hugely successful girl group Little Mix. Nelson is about to release her first solo single and she says she is happier than she has been in years. But you wouldn’t know it: she looks painfully self-conscious, unsmiling and anxious.
Photos done, she disappears to change clothes. When she returns, she’s unrecognisable. Dressed in black T-shirt, leggings and platform trainers, Nelson is all smiles; warm, giggly and uninhibited. I tell her I’ve never seen such a contrast. She laughs. “When I’m in front of a camera, I don’t know what to do. The other three girls would be in the weirdest positions and look fabulous. If I did it, I’d look awful.”

                    <span>Vaccine efficacy against infection is waning slightly with time – but efficacy against severe symptoms remains strong
Federal health authorities have recommended booster shots for all adults who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with either the the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, citing evidence that suggests breakthrough infections could become more common over time.
The plan has faced scrutiny. Some US scientists have said data was insufficient to support the decision, and vaccines remain highly effective against severe disease requiring hospitalization and death. The World Health Organization harshly criticized US leaders for using vaccines to provide a third shot to people, even as most around the world haven’t had one.

                    <span>The president’s pushing of a US-centric agenda has dismayed many but his defenders say it is ‘progressive nationalism’
For Donald Trump, the former US president, beating the drum of “America first” was something of an obsession. “The future doesn’t belong to the globalists,” he once told the UN. “The future belongs to patriots.”
Last year, he was rejected by voters in favour of Joe Biden, a committed internationalist who vowed: “America is back.” Yet the past week has shaken the faith of old allies and led some to question whether a strain of the “America first” mantra lives on.

After five years of sadistic beatings in a garden shed by one of the UK’s most prominent barristers, and with a “special beating” to mark his 21st birthday imminent, Andy Morse tried to take his own life.
The student had endured thousands of lashes on his naked buttocks administered in the name of Jesus by John Smyth QC. He could no longer endure the pain, terror and humiliation.

Serious child harm cases reported by councils in England rose by nearly 20% during the first year of the pandemic, including a 19% rise in child death notifications, according to latest official statistics.
There were 536 serious incident reports in England during 2020/21, up 87 (19%) from 449 in 2019/20, and an increase of 41% on the number of incidents recorded five years ago. Children aged under one accounted for 36% of notifications last year.

The inscription on the gravestone proudly attests to how far Marcus Venerius Secundio, a former slave of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, went in life. In order of importance, he lists his achievements after being liberated. The first was his role as custodian of the Temple of Venus, built soon after the creation of Pompeii as a Roman colony.
He also joined the ranks of the Augustales, a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship. But perhaps the most telling indication of his eventual status was that he financed entertainment events in Greek and Latin.

How many people have been evacuated from Afghanistan?
At least 12,000 people have been evacuated via Kabul airport since the start of a tumultuous rescue effort last Sunday. They include a mix of western government staff and aid agency workers, as well as Afghan residents who have worked with western governments or their agencies, or are perceived to be particularly at risk due to the nature of their work, such as journalists, translators or human rights activists.

Dutch singer Wende performs songs conceived by playwrights – on topics from bloody battles to online dating – with magnetism and a talent for storytelling
In this glorious experiment with mixed results, five playwrights – EV Crowe, Sabrina Mahfouz, Somalia Nonyé Seaton, Stef Smith and Debris Stevenson – were asked for ideas for songs, the brief no stricter than that. Conceived by Chloe Lamford, the result is an ethereal, mishmashed concert with an always brilliant band and bewitching lead singer, but varied quality of songs and lack of a through-thread.
The show – which I see a preview of – is meant to be in the much larger auditorium downstairs, but flooding has pushed it to the Court’s smaller space upstairs. The intimate nature is perfectly suited to the cosy show, with the band clustered in a circle, their instruments almost on top of each other, the audience crowded on three sides. When we’re encouraged to join in for a chorus (don’t worry, participation is minimal), there’s a sense of being gathered round a crackling fire.

St Helens score four tries in one-sided victory

There has been no shortage of unforgettable performances to settle derby matches between Wigan and St Helens in years gone by. And while this was a comprehensive victory for the reigning Super League champions, the clearest indicator yet about the gulf in class between these two famous clubs at present is that, really, St Helens had to be nowhere near faultless to inflict such an embarrassing defeat on their great rivals.
Wigan’s inconsistency has haunted them throughout 2021 while the Saints have lost only three games in all competitions as they relentlessly kept up their push for the treble here. But one stat above all else sums up this miserable performance from the Warriors: on the night they received more yellow cards than they scored points.

After the fractured skull and eye socket came the ankle ligament damage. Kevin De Bruyne has spent the summer being hurt, returning from injury and playing through the pain barrier.
His Premier League campaign began as his Euro 2020 ended, with De Bruyne a fitness doubt. He made a swifter-than-expected recovery – another recurring theme – to play for the last 12 minutes in Sunday’s defeat at Tottenham. But he missed training on Friday, leaving Pep Guardiola unsure if his talisman will face Norwich on Saturday. The Etihad Stadium will be packed for the first time since a De Bruyne masterclass against West Ham in February 2020, but he may be a spectator as his stop-start year continues. He is becoming a constant concern.

Jürgen Klopp has confirmed talks are under way on a new contract for Mohamed Salah as Liverpool look to reward the Egypt international’s prolific form and end speculation over his Anfield future.
The 29-year-old has two seasons remaining on his current contract, an incentivised deal worth up to £200,000 a week, and would be expected to receive a significant increase given his influence on the team and his global status. Liverpool have secured Virgil van Dijk, Alisson, Fabinho and Trent Alexander-Arnold on new long-term extensions recently and Klopp said last week that he expects Jordan Henderson, the captain, to follow suit. The Liverpool manager has confirmed he is also involved in efforts to extend Salah’s hugely successful Anfield career.

Brave will play Birmingham Phoenix in Lord’s final on Saturday

On a cool, translucent night at The Oval, Trent Rockets were bowled out for 96 and trounced by seven wickets in a performance that will go down as one of the most ignominious in the venerable and storied history of the Rockets franchise. For the long-suffering Rockets fans, the agonising wait for a Lord’s final goes on for another year.

The White House’s readout of a call between Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron on the crisis in Afghanistan leaves out an impassioned plea from the French president that the US and its allies have a “moral responsibility” to evacuate Afghan allies.
The French government’s readout of the conversation was released on Friday, a day after the call took place, and indicates that Macron emphasised ensuring the safe evacuation of Afghan citizens who assisted American and European troops over the past 20 years at great risk to themselves and their families.

                    <span>Resistance to measures to limit disease spread are part of history. How extreme they are depends on what leaders do, and what they allow
In the pandemic’s second year, a transnational, conspiracy-minded protest movement is becoming more vocal, and in some cases more violent, in pushing back on measures to limit the spread of new variants of the Covid-19 virus. False beliefs about the vaccines and the virus can now spread worldwide on the internet at the speed of thought. For this reason, many have pointed to online disinformation as the motor of of antivax protests.
That may be so but in other ways the protesters are following patterns which have been observed throughout recorded human history, which has seen civilisations rise and fall to the rhythm of novel epidemics.

It’s a blustery Wellington night and we’re on the brink of the second nationwide lockdown of the pandemic. There’s a measured knock at my flat door. Jemaine Clement shakes my hand warmly and removes his boots. We’re meeting off the back of the global success of his comedy series Wellington Paranormal and he is in an ebullient mood. He’s also in a thirsty one: tonight the former door-to-door orange juice salesman is plumping for copious glasses of water instead. 
Paranormal is one of two spinoffs from his and Taika Waititi’s vampire film What We Do in the Shadows. It stars Shadows’ police officers Minogue (Mike Minogue) and O’Leary (Karen O’Leary), recruited for the paranormal unit by Sgt Ruawai Maaka (Maaka Pohatu). The trio, and their colleague Const Parker (Tom Sainsbury), are oblivious, bungling and affable. Clement explains the importance of Paranormal being a collegial shoot.

                    <span>Like a bizarro David Beckham, anything that could go wrong for the Manchester United defender has tended to do just that
The straw that appears to have broken the camel’s back could scarcely have been more innocuous. On the first Sunday of October 2017, Phil Jones tweeted a reply to Simon Wood, a Masterchef-winning restaurateur who had used Twitter to flag up the presence of the Manchester United defender in his premises earlier that evening. “Fantastic food,” wrote Phil, by way of acknowledgement for the shout-out. “Me and the wife will be back soon. Thank you.”
It was in keeping with the kind of mundane to and fro in which Jones occasionally engaged on a social media account that seemed to be curated by the player himself rather than a team of in-house social media strategists. Promotional tweets, presumably posted at the behest of his sponsors Adidas, were occasionally punctuated by birthday greetings and other supportive messages for strangers and colleagues alike. Not the kind of content a man would expect to get his two million followers exercised.

Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said there were mounting problems for the industry after a month when a hoped-for rise in spending following the end of most pandemic restrictions failed to materialise.

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has hit the highest annual level in a decade, a new report has shown, despite increasing global concern over the accelerating devastation since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019.
Between August 2020 and July 2021, the rainforest lost 10.476 square kilometers – an area nearly seven times bigger than greater London and 13 times the size of New York City, according to data released by Imazon, a Brazilian research institute that has been tracking the Amazon deforestation since 2008. The figure is 57% higher than in the previous year and is the worst since 2012.

                    <span>Car salesman Paul Drummond lets American slip into gear
England’s Georgia Hall shares halfway lead with Mina Harigae

It doesn’t seem to have been much of a hardship for Paul Drummond to take a week off from his family’s car sales business in Carnoustie. Drummond, a 31-year-old plus-two handicap who caddies at the championship links in his spare time, finds himself on the bag for Lexi Thompson at the Women’s Open. The spontaneous alliance is working a treat thus far; Thompson added a 70 to Thursday’s 69 to ease into contention on the Angus coast. Drummond, in branded gear, looks every bit the tour caddie.
Thompson’s regular looper, Jack Fulghum, was unwell amid severe heat at the Olympics. It appears the partnership may have formally ended in any case. Thompson made contact with the Carnoustie caddie master last weekend, with Drummond duly recommended for the highest-profile role of his “other” job. Even the language barrier has delivered no problems. “He speaks very slowly to me,” said the Floridian Thompson of her Scottish assistant. “I’m fully trusting him on his numbers and whether to hit it left or right of the pin and he has been spot on.”

                    <span>Painter of huge portraits that explored the relationship between painting and photography
In the 1960s Chuck Close, fresh from art school, was sitting in a New York restaurant when Jasper Johns walked in, passing by his fellow diners in total anonymity despite the older painter’s great fame. After seven decades of self-portraits, Close, who has died aged 81, never suffered the same fate, his face recognisable to generations of museum-goers. In 2017 this storied career abruptly ended following sexual misconduct allegations.
Close painted on a huge scale, the acrylics or oils flatly applied with little discernible brushstrokes. He always started with a photograph as source material, rigidly divided by an overlaid grid, which he would replicate, colours and forms, square by square, on to canvas using a variety of tools including razorblades, electric drills and airbrushes. The artist also brought the faces of his peers from obscurity, completing portraits of Kiki Smith, Alex Katz, Cindy Sherman, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists, as well as the more readily recognisable Barack Obama, Al Gore, Brad Pitt and Kate Moss.

                    <span>The US and UK say evacuations are gathering pace, but there seems to be little sign of that in Kabul
The Kabul airport gates were a path not to escape but to hospital for one Afghan human rights activist this week.
A relative was shot in the head in the melee of people trying to leave, and so she spent the evening trudging to a market to buy alcohol and gauze for his wounds. The hospital had run out.

The Plymouth gunman was not charged or cautioned after he carried out a vicious assault in a city park last year, but instead was allowed to take part in a four-month rehabilitation scheme, it has emerged.
Jake Davison’s legally held shotgun was confiscated after he began the Pathfinder scheme and a worker from it found out he had the weapon and informed Devon and Cornwall police. But the shotgun was handed back last month after he finished the programme.

                    <span>Vast disparities in income may have lost some of their power to shock. But they remain a gross injustice
Public anger about the vast salaries extracted from business by the highest-paid people surfaces less often than one might expect, given highly conspicuous levels of inequality and rising poverty. Sir Philip Green and Fred Goodwin are rare in having become notorious big earners: Sir Philip because of the collapse of BHS, as well as his own inflated rewards and oligarchic lifestyle; Mr Goodwin because he exemplified a greedy banker type at a time when anger at banks was at its peak.
More recently, a colossal £75m bonus paid to the chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, resulted in his departure from the business. But Mr Fairburn – who was reported earlier this year to have failed to keep a promise to set up a charity – did not become a household name.

Dominic Raab appears to have been saved this week by Boris Johnson’s exceptionally high threshold for sacking ministers. For now, the foreign secretary has joined the reshuffle waiting room, sitting in ministerial limbo alongside Gavin Williamson and Priti Patel.
The prime minister has faced pressure from within his own party as well as from the opposition to remove them all – over Williamson’s failure on exams for two years in a row, the finding that Patel bullied staff, and Raab’s ill-advised holiday at the height of an international crisis.

                    <span>The past year has rightly shifted the way that cultural value is estimated
In living memory, there has been no worse year for museums and galleries, along with many other arts organisations. With closure forced on them by the pandemic, they were unable to earn money from ticket sales, shops or cafes; when they reopened for a time last summer, and again this spring, they had to cope with reduced footfall and the costs of expensive interventions to render them Covid-safe. Some of their funders, especially local authorities, have suffered gravely too, with cuts at times passed on.
The Museums Prize, run by the charity Art Fund, has a distinguished history of rewarding excellence in British institutions. Often in the past the focus has been on multimillion-pound, attention-grabbing capital projects. The past two years, though, have seen a shift in the focus of the prize – one that may portend a wider change of emphasis in how cultural value is estimated. In 2020, the prize, which was already in process when the pandemic hit, was split between the shortlisted candidates, the prize money having been doubled to £200,000. This year, entrants were asked three simple questions: what did you do that showed imagination and determination? How do you think this made a difference? How will you build on this in the future?

                    <span>Literary prize culture favours young and marketable writers – and the new Futures scheme is simply adding to the problem
Last week, the Women’s prize announced a new award in partnership with Good Housekeeping magazine. “Futures” will provide promotional support to 10 female writers of fiction in the UK and Ireland who have published one book. The award, however, has an age limit of 35.
It’s great to encourage young writers, so what’s the problem? The arts world is already deluged with age-limited awards. Big prizes include the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year award (for under-35s), the Dylan Thomas (for under-39s) and the Rooney prize (for under-40s) in Ireland. There are also a host of smaller age-limited grants, residencies and other opportunities, not to mention publicity campaigns similar to Futures, such a Granta’s Best Young British Novelists (for under-40s) and their Best Young Spanish Novelists (who, for some reason, have to make it even faster, by the age of 35). The assumption, it seems, is that older writers are so culturally or financially secure that they have no need for money or recognition.

                    <span>Readers respond to a feature on women forced out of work by menopause and a report on suggestions that menopause should be a protected characteristic under the Equality Act
Middle-aged women and others going through the menopause experience unacceptable discrimination. However, the law as it stands means legal cases challenging menopause-related discrimination need to be brought on grounds of sex, age or disability.
If the law currently works inadequately, should menopause be added to the list of grounds recognised by the Equality Act 2010 (Equality laws could be changed to protect women in menopause, says MP, 18 August)? In our view, menopause-based discrimination highlights instead the relevance and value of an “intersectional” approach. This recognises that discrimination is often due to a combination of social biases. Kimberlé Crenshaw, who developed the term in the late 1980s, focused on the disadvantages that black women faced and the inadequate response of American anti-discrimination law to their experiences.

                    <span>The legacy of Boris Johnson’s initial approach to the pandemic can be measured in lives needlessly lost and ruined, says Michael Rosen
Your report on US officials’ reaction to Boris Johnson’s initial coronavirus policy, to aim for herd immunity (Trump team thought UK officials ‘out of their minds’ aiming for herd immunity, book says, 19 August), confirms what many of us have been saying for some time. If we follow the timeline of what he said and did in the months leading up to the first lockdown of 16 March last year, we can indeed see quite clearly that herd immunity was the first go-to policy.
Some examples: Johnson saying on 3 February that he was against “market segregation” as a way of dealing with the coronavirus – in other words, he was against a government-led intervention policy that might hamper trade. Later, on 3 March, he described how safe it was to shake hands with Covid patients and said that he would go on doing so. On 12 March, Robert Peston, presumably armed with his usual first-hand knowledge, wrote in the Spectator how herd immunity was the policy of the day. As late as 13 March, government scientists, speaking on BBC Two’s Newsnight and Radio 4’s Today programme, spoke openly of herd immunity as being the inevitable or necessary approach.

Morrisons shares have surged again as investors bet the £7bn price tag on the company could go higher still amid a private equity bidding war for control.
They closed up 4% at 291p, 6p more than the 285p a share offer lodged on Thursday by US group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R). The £7bn offer is £300m more than the £6.7bn on the table from rival suitor’s Fortress but the share price move suggests the winner may have to dig even deeper as that 6p equates to more than £150m.

More than 9,000 Covid infections were linked to Euro 2020 football games monitored for the government’s mass events test scheme, and scientists have said the tournament generated “a significant risk to public health”.
An analysis of the third and final stage of the research programme, released on Friday, found that more than 85% of all the infections connected to the 49 days of various outdoor sport, music and entertainment events came from the eight Euros games involved, and mainly the semi-final and final.

Data on the use of 16 swearwords in the 1990s and the 2010s shows the f-word was the most frequently used, taking the title from “bloody” which was beaten into third place by “shit”.

Chuck Close, painter of outsized photorealist portraits, dies aged 81

Hugely enlarged, Chuck Close stares back at you from behind his glasses, a cigarette lodged in the corner of his mouth. It is a face with a what-you-looking-at stare, and you look back, dwarfed by his image, thinking get-out-of-my-face in return.
Taking us from the top of his head to his sprouting chest hair, via every pore and bristle, the artist’s unkempt anti-grooming and non-coiffure, the trickle of smoke exhaled from his nostril, Close’s 1967-8 Big Self-Portrait charts every centimetre of his black and white photograph, which was gridded, enlarged and copied on to the canvas, then painted using a spray gun. All the aberrations of the original photograph, with its blank background and out-of-focus ear, are retained in the painting. The tip of the smouldering cigarette looms out at you. It makes you want to duck. Painted when Close was in his late 20s, the self-portrait was Close’s big move, both calling card and confrontation.

However, migration experts warned that the vast majority of Afghan citizens already displaced by the fighting that brought the new regime to power will be left stranded unless European states proactively work to negotiate a safe corridor out of the country.

                    <span>Club that helped launch careers of Olympians – and Jason Statham – hopes London mayor will take the plunge on £1.3m repairs
As the story goes, Jason Statham’s impromptu standing back somersault during a real-life pub lock-in with Guy Ritchie was not only the inspiration for a scene in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but also ended up launching his career. “Before all of his fame with the movies and everything, he was a proper diver who trained at Crystal Palace,” recalls Gill Snode, a co-founder of Crystal Palace diving club.
Yet while Statham went all the way to Hollywood after being one of the thousands of promising young athletes who trained at the National Sports Centre, south London’s current crop of divers appears to have been forgotten.

Almost all of England and most of Wales and Northern Ireland are likely to be hit by thunderstorms on Saturday, forecasters have said.
The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for heavy showers and thunder, which could cause flooding, power cuts and travel disruption across much of the UK.

                    <span>Our battle to restore a statement to a Manchester exhibition was really about what can and can’t be said in cultural spaces
On Wednesday, protesters in Manchester reclaimed one of the city’s main cultural institutions. Despite the rain, pro-Palestine activists gathered in front of the closed doors of the Whitworth gallery, part of the University of Manchester. It was because of their persistent action, and 13,000 letters sent to the gallery, that part of our exhibition, a printed statement titled “Forensic Architecture stands with Palestine”, has been reinstated. The exhibition, which we insisted be shut as a result of the statement’s unilateral removal, has now reopened.
On Sunday 15 August, a blog post on the website of UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) announced that, following the group’s intervention, the statement had been removed from our exhibition, Cloud Studies. When we first heard of the news, we were not altogether surprised. The same group had already criticised a statement of solidarity with Palestinians published on the Whitworth’s website in June, and succeeded in convincing the university to have it removed. And this was hardly UKLFI’s first attack on us as an organisation. In 2018, when we were nominated for the Turner prize, UKLFI urged the Tate not to award the prize to us on the outrageous grounds that documents that we had published in relation to Palestine amounted to “modern blood libels likely to promote antisemitism and attacks on Jews”.

Beloved children’s author and illustrator Jill Murphy has died at the age of 72. Murphy was best known for writing children’s book series The Worst Witch and The Large Family.
Murphy’s publisher Macmillan announced the author’s death in a statement, saying that she had died “peacefully” in a Cornwall hospital on Wednesday “following a long struggle with cancer”. Her son Charlie and her niece Isabelle were with her.

The ongoing disaster in Afghanistan is only the latest fiasco to provoke fury at the unseriousness of Boris Johnson’s government. In fact, for the past 20 years British and American conservatism has seemed ever more unrealistic: its policies ever more like fantasies, its relationship with the truth ever looser, its leaders ever less focused and competent.
This persistent unrealism has had terrible costs. And yet, without seeming to have mastered the basics of governing, conservatives still win plenty of elections, and dominate how politics is talked and thought about. To many voters and commentators, conservative government, however much it fails in practice, is still the realistic option.

                    <span>New releases by three pop icons reveal their extreme attempts to protect themselves from the damage caused by fame. Pop stardom has never seemed less aspirational
The mechanisms of pop stardom have never been subject to as much scrutiny as they are now. Britney Spears’ conservatorship struggle exposed their potential for (alleged) abuse. Raye recently split from her major label, Polydor, after she reached breaking point and shared her frustrations about not being allowed to release her debut album despite signing in 2014 and helming numerous massive hit singles. Former X Factor winner Rebecca Ferguson has called for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged widespread music industry wrongdoing. That labels should root out exploitative and predatory behaviour and protect exposed young stars is a baseline requirement. But increasingly it seems that the existential state of pop stardom – particularly for young women, subject to greater scrutiny than their male peers and often held to contradictory standards – is intolerable beyond any level of protection.

Rupert Murdoch has largely lost a year-long dispute with the BBC after he objected to a documentary series that “implied he posed a threat to liberal democracy”.
Murdoch’s News UK business complained that a BBC Two documentary unfairly suggested the Australian-born media mogul “exercised malign political influence” through his ownership of news outlets. It said the BBC programme was biased and failed to give enough weight to more positive appraisals of Murdoch’s career.

The billionaire chief executive of the electric carmaker Tesla said the robot, which would be about 5ft 8in (1.7m) tall and weigh 125 pounds (56kg), would be able to handle tasks such as attaching bolts to cars with a spanner or picking up groceries at stores.

There’s still something inside me that knows it’s a Games year. Even though I last competed at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, it’s almost like my body has become attuned to being ready. You wake up and there’s this feeling: “Wow, I know something special is happening.” And that’s true even in this strange, fifth year of the cycle.
I have a sense of excitement as the Games approaches, but – fortunately – I don’t have any of the pressures; the pressures of qualifying for the Games and now of making sure you’re ready for them. It’s about this point in the buildup that athletes start to really worry. You’re trying to get your form right. But you’re also paranoid about getting injured, and about staying away from anyone who might have a cold. This year, of course, there is Covid to think of too. You catch that, you’re potentially out of the Games or even worse. I can’t imagine what it must be like getting ready for Tokyo right now, people must have wrapped themselves in cotton wool.

This week, demonstrators including fishers and other local workers blocked the roads in Gwadar, a coastal town in Balochistan. They burned tyres, chanted slogans and largely shut down the city, to demand water and electricity and a stop to Chinese trawlers illegally fishing in the nearby waters and then taking the fish to China. Two people were injured when the authorities cracked down on the protesters.

About nine in 10 people in the UK are still wearing face coverings at least some of the time despite them no longer being compulsory, official figures show.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) data suggests face coverings in some settings could be one of the Covid-enforced changes to daily life in the UK that remain after the pandemic has subsided.

My wife and I have decided to move with our two young sons to her home country. It was a difficult decision and we spent a long time making it, but we believe it’s an opportunity for a better life that we have to take now.
My mother-in-law is not well and we have not seen my wife’s family for two years. However, my parents are struggling to accept our decision. They doubt the wisdom of the move, and initially took the view that my wife had pressured me into going. My wife found this hurtful; especially that my parents did not appreciate why she might want to spend time with her own mother. I was also infuriated by the notion that I was incapable of making such a momentous decision with my eyes open – and in support of my wife. I have kept all this from my parents because I do not want conflict and to leave in such an atmosphere.

Wes Streeting can’t claim to be his inner-city comp’s most famous alumni. That claim goes to the Hollywood actor John Boyega who, like the shadow child poverty secretary, also came from a council estate and went on to Westminster City school, which was in special measures during Streeting’s time.
Now, Streeting says, opportunities are rapidly diminishing for state school pupils like them. His own school has had to make hard choices about funding extracurricular activities, meaning after-school drama there – despite its Star Wars-famed alumnus – has been a casualty.

                    <span>Agreement means Greens will be in power for first time in UK with two ministerial roles for party
The Scottish National party and the Scottish Greens have confirmed a power-sharing agreement, ushering the Green party into government for the first time in the UK in a change designed to bolster the case for independence.
Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement would make it “impossible” for the UK government to refuse a second independence referendum but environmental campaigners expressed disappointment that the text fell short of calling for an immediate end to oil and gas exploration.

Evidence of Taliban killings, detentions and intimidation is emerging across Afghanistan, ominously contradicting the hardline Islamist group’s promise earlier this week not to take revenge against its opponents.
With reports of the Taliban going door to door searching for people who worked with the former Afghan government or western countries, claims have also emerged of Taliban fighters torturing and killing members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan after overrunning their village last month.

Firms grapple with homeworking puzzle

You can ask to work remotely on a permanent basis but your boss does not have to agree. Matt Gingell, an employment lawyer, says staff are not automatically entitled to flexible working unless the arrangement is part of their contract.

The plan, which was informed by women’s own testimonies, is described as “the first stage of a long-term commitment to reducing health inequalities for women”. The 68-page document also pledges to appoint a national women’s health champion, establish a research fund to close gaps in scientific and medical knowledge and improve information and public awareness of heart disease symptoms and risks for women.
