He’s a four-time gold medallist for his native China, but is representing the green and gold for the first time at Tokyo. He lost his right arm at the aged of five, after he was bitten by a bear in a zoo accident.

Afghanistan “remains a highly dangerous environment,” he says. 
There are a large number who are now accommodated at the United Arab Emirates and we thank the United Arab Emirates for the great support ensuring we can brings people safely there.
There are two transfer flights that are due to depart there today, one arrived this morning, 639 people who have been evacuated are already now here in Australia, including 221 arrived earlier today. Australian citizens, residents and pre-visa Afghan nationals are the priority for transfer flights back to Australia.

On Wednesday, a stream of military planes took off from the airfield as evacuees lined up on the tarmac, AP reports:
The desperate remained outside, some standing knee-deep in sewage and waving identity documents at Western soldiers in hopes of being allowed to go beyond the barbed wire fencing and onto a flight out.
While the final withdrawal date just under a week away, analyst Patricia Lewis said the practical deadline for the evacuations to stop was ‘the next couple of days.’

A Covid-19 modeller has suggested New Zealand’s North and South islands could become separate bubbles as the country grapples with a coronavirus outbreak, although South islanders with hopes of being fully released from lockdown should not hold their breath just yet.
New Zealand is battling to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant that swiftly led to a nationwide, level four lockdown – the highest setting – which has been extended until at least the end of the week. There are now 210 cases in the community.

Signs of life beyond our solar system may be detectable within two to three years, experts have said after rethinking the kinds of planets that may be habitable.
Researchers have mostly looked for planets of a similar size, mass, temperature and atmospheric composition to Earth. But University of Cambridge astronomers believe there may be more promising possibilities after recent work suggested that a “mini-Neptune” more than twice the radius of Earth and more than eight times as massive may also be habitable.

None of us realised how good we had it in 2007, in our pre-Trump, pre-Brexit, pre-Covid bubble. We even had a Labour government, for chrissakes.
And we had Gossip Girl, a perfect confection of madness, the bubbles at the brim of our overfilled cup of complacency. It followed a group of uber-rich Upper East Side New York high schoolers who had names as excellent as their lives. Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester – yes, the actors had equally unbelievable names) was the queen bee, while her best friend/frenemy was Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively – see!). The permutations of their relationships with Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick), Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford, whose jawline should have got separate billing), poverty-stricken Dan and Jenny Humphreys (Penn Badgley and Taylor Momsen, who lived in a loft apartment in – ugh – Brooklyn) and Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr) formed the mainstay of the show. There were also the times Blair became the princess of Monaco and Elizabeth Hurley played Nate’s boss and girlfriend so badly for 14 episodes that it is spoken of only in hushed whispers on the darknet.

Ofcom has announced its withdrawal from a diversity scheme run by LGBT+ charity Stonewall.
The communications regulator said in a statement it has withdrawn from the Stonewall Diversity Champions programme because of “the need to remain impartial and independent at all times” and because taking part “poses a conflict or risk of perceived bias”.

‘Playing a Copa América – I want to have that experience’

Pep Guardiola has said he plans to leave Manchester City when his current contract runs out in 2023. The 50-year-old Spaniard, who joined City in 2016 and has won three Premier League titles, feels he will need a rest after seven years in charge.

Ty Garbin admitted his role in the alleged scheme weeks after his arrest last fall. He is among six men charged in federal court but the only one to plead guilty so far. It was an important victory for prosecutors as they try to prove the other five men were involved in the astonishing plot.

Wigan on the brink of dropping out of Super League’s play-offs

Sometimes, the statistics speak entirely for themselves. Wigan Warriors are one of rugby league’s most famous and successful clubs but there is no doubting that at present this proud sporting institution are simply not at the races – and they are now on the brink of dropping out of Super League’s play-off places altogether.
For the first time since 1991, Wigan have failed to score at home. They have gone over 200 minutes without scoring a try. The Warriors have not failed to score a try at home in consecutive games for almost 60 years, dating back to 1965. Given the lofty standards Wigan have created for themselves throughout rugby league history, those numbers scream more about their current plight than this result or performance ever could.

                    <span>If it was an indignity for Arsenal to enter the Carabao Cup at this early stage because of their absence from European competition, they booked their passage to the next round by showing true class. Against a Championship club’s reserves, admittedly, but this was a demonstration from which Mikel Arteta and his team can take heart.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his first start of the season, and Nicolas Pépé, Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette also netted in a match in which the visitors threatened to score nearly every time they attacked. Now all they have to do is play like this regularly against stronger opponents. Then trust will grow in Arsenal’s players and Arteta’s process.

Jimmy Anderson could scarcely contain his delight after a dreamy first day of the third Test against India gave England a vice-like grip on proceedings. 
Anderson’s three‑wicket new-ball burst helped to skittle the tourists for just 78 all out – the ninth lowest total in their history – before unbeaten half-centuries from Haseeb Hameed and Rory Burns took Joe Root’s side to 120 for no loss at the close.

There is a sign by the gate stating “British passport holders only”. Inside the hotel, officials are working to grant evacuation visas for thousands of UK nationals and Afghan citizens who have worked for British organisations. Diplomatic staff say they are “processing hundreds every hour”, but there is a growing sense of despair among the crowds who have been waiting outside since the start of the week – and tensions are rising.

Guileless hero Christopher Blank is ‘born without a single funny bone in his body’ in a one-man play that paints a near future US in broad brushstrokes
Comedians becoming politicians and pundits. Politicians playing the lovable buffoon. Are we edging into a world that overvalues humour and ostracises the serious-minded? That’s the dystopia imagined in John Feffer’s one-man play, which traces the journey of Christopher Blank, “born without a single funny bone in his body”, through a near-future US where a lack of humour is a crime. It’s a grabby premise and I’m absolutely here for an inquiry into the insidious uses of humour in public life. But its relationship to our current reality feels tenuous.
Not that there’s any gainsaying Feffer’s expertise: by day, he’s a foreign policy expert at Washington DC’s Institute for Policy Studies. In a performance recorded at Baltimore Theatre Project earlier this year, he plays both our guileless hero Christopher and the wisecracking Groucho Marx-alike President Gumball; other characters are projected (video design by Kelly Colburn and Dylan Uremovich) on to a stacked-boxes set. We watch as social misfit Christopher is cast out by his uncomprehending parents, co-opted at university by a revolutionary cadre of humour-phobes, then caught up in a cold war between the US and the so-called Federation, a USSR-alike where jokes are strictly samizdat.

In his 15-year career as a batter and captain, Kohli has pretty much seen it all. He has played international cricket in 17 countries, overcome adversity of every sort, faced down every kind of challenge in every format. But he has never won the toss at Headingley before.

About 50 British citizens, many with dual Afghan nationality, were understood to be outside Kabul airport on Wednesday. Some said they were waving their UK passports aloft in a desperate effort to flee as the deadline for western forces’ departure closed in.

Nine Perfect Strangers, the Hulu limited series which premiered on 18 August, would appear to offer at least some of these draws.

                    <span>‘Eco-friendly’ lights found to be worse than sodium ones – but both contribute to insect decline, says study
“Eco-friendly” LED streetlights produce even worse light pollution for insects than the traditional sodium bulbs they are replacing, a study has found.
The abundance of moth caterpillars in hedgerows by rural roads in England was 52% lower under LED lights and 41% lower under sodium lights when compared with nearby unlit areas.

After all that, it took only eight words for Harry Kane to confirm the news most Tottenham supporters had been desperately hoping to hear. Yet while the England captain’s tweet on Wednesday lunchtime may not have come as that much of a surprise following a summer transfer saga that has never really taken off, its contents were clearly designed to build bridges at the club he joined as an 11-year-old.
“I will be staying at Tottenham this summer,” wrote Kane in a message that will have certainly made the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, smile, “and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success.”

Draghi, the chair of the G20 group of nations, has been working on the plan for days, holding talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The Italian prime minister is also expected to hold a call with the Chinese resident, Xi Jinping, this week.

The government is under pressure to relax post-Brexit migration rules to unblock Britain’s worst supply-chain crisis since the 1970s, with business leaders warning that continued disruption could ruin Christmas.
Industry bosses said urgent changes to the visa system were required as retailers struggle to keep shelves stocked, and restaurants run out of food and drink in the meltdown triggered by Covid and Brexit.

                    <span>The pandemic disrupted supply chains, but that issue is being used as political camouflage to disguise the failings of Brexit 
Most of the system that puts food on the 21st-century table is a mystery to the consumer, who is usually happy in ignorance. If the complex logistics – picking, processing, packing, and distributing – make headlines it is because something has gone wrong.
Currently, two very big things have gone wrong, leading to gaps on supermarket shelves. One is the pandemic, which has slowed the movement of goods and people across borders, while raising shipping costs. Any broken link in global supply chains causes a cascade of disruption which affects many countries. But Britain has a second, aggravating condition to contend with – Brexit.

                    <span>Richer countries must wake up and see the bigger Covid picture
The statistics are stark and shaming. During an exasperated intervention earlier this week, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that of 4.8bn Covid vaccine doses delivered around the world to date, around 75% have gone to just 10 countries. The level of vaccine donations from richer countries, he added with some understatement, has been “really disappointing”. In Africa, where a third wave of the virus has been on the march since May, less than 2% of the continent’s population has received a first dose. While high-income countries across the globe have administered around 100 doses for every 100 citizens, the equivalent figure for low-income countries is 1.5.
As a consequence, while the United States, Britain and other richer nations begin to roll out programmes for booster shots in the autumn, a pandemic of the unvaccinated continues unabated elsewhere. The WHO’s target of reaching 10% of the population of every country with a first shot by the end of September is unlikely to be met. This grotesque inequity, as Mr Ghebreyesus and others have repeatedly pointed out, is ultimately in no one’s interest. Allowing much of the planet to operate as a variant factory, and the more transmissible Delta variant to run riot, stores up trouble for the future. “Vaccinating the world” should therefore be seen as sound strategy as well as an ethical obligation. But, in Europe and North America, early good intentions have so far come a distant second to domestic priorities.

Before changes are due to be signed off by the government on Thursday, there is also pressure for restrictions to be eased on passengers arriving from Pakistan.

When coronavirus hit international fashion manufacturing centres last year, many Australian designers pivoted to making clothes onshore. But as Sydney’s lockdown extends into the second half of 2021, garment factories are struggling to stay open and the long-term viability of manufacturing in Australia is under threat.
Sydney’s inner west is usually a busy hub of clothing manufacturing. But the machinists who power this industry often commute in from the city’s south west, an area subject to the strictest lockdown orders in New South Wales.

Dame Sarah Storey isn’t usually one for public displays of emotion. The 43-year-old has competed relentlessly for almost 30 years, across two sports and at eight Paralympic Games, but has rarely shown so much as a glimpse of vulnerability. But as she clasped her 15th gold medal in the Izu Velodrome on Wednesday, the thought of her absent family made her break down in tears.
“It’s hugely difficult being without them,” she said after her victory in the 3,000m individual pursuit. “It is really, really hard. You know, they are the biggest motivation. But now I can’t be with them and share it with them and after all of the things they put up with. They do so much to enable me to do this. I am hugely grateful to them.”

They represent the most serious cases it investigated, and a fraction of more than 94,000 uses over that period – leading police to attack the findings as selective and out of date.

A first poster has been released for Spencer, the forthcoming film about three days in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, starring Kristen Stewart and directed by Pablo Larraín. The poster comes a week before the biopic is due to premiere at Venice film festival.
The image appears to show Stewart bent double and weeping into a vast white gown, likely to be a version of the “Diaghilev” gown Diana Spencer wore on occasions such as a visit to the Royal Opera House and the film premiere of The Living Daylights. It was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who also created her wedding dress.

With the disturbing news that the window for evacuations from Afghanistan is closing (UK evacuation from Kabul to end within ‘24 to 36 hours’, defence sources say, 24 August), all governments should ask themselves: what is the moral response to this deepening crisis?
We urge the British government to go further in helping at-risk Afghans, human rights defenders and women activists, and create safe passages so that people can find sanctuary without resorting to dangerous journeys. We have seen in our parishes the warm response to refugees from Afghanistan and other parts of the world. As a nation, we should not be led by a quota, but by the need and pain before us.

                    <span>The nuclear power industry has successfully rebranded an appallingly toxic energy industry by never mentioning the terrible legacy of nuclear waste, writes Ann Denise Lanes
Re your report (Nuclear storage plans for north of England stir up local opposition, 23 August), it is no surprise that ongoing discussions to choose locations for the dumping of nuclear waste are cloaked in secrecy.
Over the last decade, the nuclear power industry has successfully rebranded an appallingly toxic energy industry as “zero carbon” and even “clean” (Zero-carbon electricity outstrips fossil fuels in Britain across 2019, 1 January 2020) by never mentioning the terrible legacy of nuclear waste. Nuclear energy is neither clean nor zero-carbon when you consider its complete fuel cycle, from uranium mining overseas to the energy-intensive production of fuel rods to the management of highly toxic radioactive waste products such as plutonium.

The Unite union is expected to develop a calmer but more distant relationship with the Labour party after the election of the leftwinger Sharon Graham as its first female general secretary on Wednesday.
Graham, who was the surprise winner in the three-way contest with 37.7% of the vote, was elected on a manifesto that said “we have tried our political project within Labour – it has failed”. She has said she intends to prioritise workplace organising in her new role.

                    <span>Workplace democracy would allow us to come out of the pandemic with a greater sense of control over the future
With most formal Covid restrictions all but melted away, freedom prevails. Back to the workplace, Tory ministers make demands of our newly liberated workforce: the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, warns young workers that continuing to work from home may risk their careers. Though markedly softer in tone than last summer – when ministers demanded, through the press, to “Go back to work or risk losing your job” – the message is clear, at least in England: pubs and bars may be thronged again, but the ancien regime of work must be restored in full.
Yet as wars have disrupted the old ways of doing things, spurring on demands that widespread sacrifice should be rewarded with new rights and freedoms, so it should be with the pandemic. In her successful campaign to become general secretary of Britain’s largest private sector union, Unite, Sharon Graham said the organisation “should get back to the workplace and deliver what it says on the trade union tin – a relentless fight for jobs, pay and conditions”.

Serena Williams has withdrawn from the US Open, marking another major setback in a difficult season.
Williams, who turns 40 next month, has not competed since she was forced to withdraw from her first-round match at Wimbledon after falling on the slippery grass courts against Aliaksandra Sasnovich, tearing her right hamstring and then leaving the court in tears.

Germany’s Green party has been accused of attempting to revive its hippyish origins rather than tackle the challenges of the present with the release of a campaign ad for next month’s federal election that revives a 19th-century folk song.
Five weeks before a general election, in which at one point the party was leading in the polls, the one-minute-long commercial is being seen by some critics as a deliberate and last-ditch attempt to appeal to as wide a constituency as possible as it battles for second place against the resurgent Social Democrats.

                    <span>Celebrated artist admired for her paintings of flowers and the first woman to be elected to both the Royal and Royal Scottish academies
In 1994, the year that Damien Hirst made his first vitrined sheep, Away from the Flock, pickled in formaldehyde, the artist Elizabeth Blackadder, who has died aged 89, finished a work called Still Life With Cats. The cats were painted in oil on canvas, joining many others in Blackadder’s oeuvre, alongside arum lilies, Japanese fans and tins of sweets.
Mere difference of age does not explain the gap between Blackadder’s art and Hirst’s. Painters of her own generation – Bridget Riley was born in the same year, 1931 – worked in a style that was insistently modern. This was not Blackadder’s way. When she and her husband, the artist John Houston, visited New York in 1969 on the way to paint the Wyoming landscape, they made trips to the Museum of Modern Art to see Picasso and Matisse, not Pollock and Warhol. Modern art institutions returned the compliment: there are only half a dozen or so Blackadders in the Tate, all but one of them lithographs, few ever on show and none more recent than 1963. The British Council Collection holds only two Blackadders, the Arts Council’s none at all. And yet, there is more to the story than meets the eye.

                    <span>A prolonged malaise caused by deep-seated structural problems has prevented a full economic recovery post-2007
Every year since 1978 the world’s central bankers have gathered to chew the fat at Jackson Hole in the Grand Tetons. This year’s star attraction is the most influential central banker of them all – Jerome Powell – and financial markets will hang on every word from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Powell won’t reveal much and for good reason: he doesn’t have all that much to say. He is worried about inflation but there are also signs the US economy is slowing as coronavirus infection rates rise. The pace of recovery is moderating in the UK, Germany, China and pretty much everywhere else as well. There are shortages of materials and labour. In a world of lockdowns, quarantines and travel restrictions, it is proving harder to sustain a model built around frictionless movement of people, parts and finance. Global supply chains are under pressure.

                    <span>Nia DaCosta’s quasi reboot develops the horror myth as an expression of rage against racism in the era of Black Lives Matter
Candyman, in its first incarnation, stepped daintily out of the mirror in 1992, in writer-director Bernard Rose’s US-set version of the Clive Barker novella The Forbidden, a parable of English class shame set in a Liverpool housing estate. Rose shifted the locale to Chicago’s deprived Cabrini-Green projects, switched the racial identity of the demon from white to black and gave filmgoers that inspired premise of exactly how he is summoned by rash unbelievers and giggling teens. Since then, Candyman has spawned sequels, references, memes and gags: such as Handyman – say his name five times in the mirror and he shows up three hours later and does a horrific job on your boiler.

                    <span>Vogue, Harper’s and Elle turn the spotlight on razzle dazzle and bright colours as we emerge from Covid gloom
In an unusual move, the cover of British Vogue features the time the photograph on it was shot: 4.57am. The image, of actor and activist Gemma Chan reclining on a boat on the Thames as the sun rises, is symbolic of a new dawn in this September’s glossy magazines. The biggest, bulkiest and most important of the year, they signal what can be expected in the industry in the months ahead. This year, though, they herald not just a new season but what can be expected from post-pandemic dressing (even if the pandemic isn’t yet fully in the rear-view mirror).
From Vogue to Elle and Harper’s Bazaar, this year’s offering, which is slimmer on the ground than in recent years, since Marie Claire stopping print in 2019 and Katy Grand exited Love Magazine last year, seem to be on the same page in terms of laying out new sartorial spirit. Now is the time, they say, for sequins and silver and dressing up for parties and going out-out rather than dressing down for sofas. Just as, after the first world war and the 1918 flu pandemic, the 1920s brought flappers and flamboyance, this new dawn is the 21st century’s own roaring 20s. And the vibe is one of hedonism and creativity after the Covid restrictions caused stasis and the rise of elasticated waists.

                    <span>This year’s Karlovy Vary saw the premiere of a dizzying single-take drama featuring a potent lead performance from Graham as a chef enduring a nightmarish evening
Philip Barantini serves up a single-take headlong nightmare in this drama set in a restaurant, starring the formidable Stephen Graham as an up-and-coming chef called Andy who is running on pure adrenaline, and maybe something more in that water bottle of his. Without any cuts to darkness or a camera flash, Barantini follows the dizzying continuous action in the kitchens and out in the dining room as the pressure begins to take its toll on everyone. And if it looks a bit like TV sometimes, that could be because cookery shows with stressed-out gobby chefs yelling at people are all over television. One of those shows was actually called Ramsay’s Boiling Point.
Andy is seen showing up ominously late for work one evening, talking on his mobile, trying to juggle some tricky situation in his disintegrating domestic life. Already, his highly professional support staff are dismayed at his behaviour and how they will be expected to cover up for him, even as he takes it out on members of the team junior to them. His trusted seniors are Carly (Vinette Robinson) and commis chef Freeman (Ray Panthaki). Meanwhile, the front-of-house maitre d’ Beth (Alice Feetham) is far too ready to accommodate off-menu requests from annoying food influencers with big Instagram followings. There are many other plot-flavours in this seething stew, but the biggest nightmare is that Andy’s former boss, telly celebrity chef Alastair Skye (a fantastically unctuous Jason Flemyng) has chosen tonight of all nights to show up, bringing with him sleek food critic Sara Southworth (Lourdes Faberes); for all Alastair’s fame he is none too pleased at how well his former protege appears to be doing. Could his appearance be some sort of implied threat?

London’s second biggest airport will launch a public consultation next month on a scheme to enlarge capacity to a potential 75.5 million passengers a year – despite still only serving about a quarter of its pre-Covid traffic in August.

The investigation asserts a disconnect between the information Apple knows about a user, which includes their self-declared age, and the ways it polices age restrictions on its App Store.

It’s easy to find out when Ian Botham last played cricket, because there is Wisden, but it’s hard to find out when John Cleese was last funny. Some people think he had some moderately amusing lines in A Fish Called Wanda (1988). There was a period in the 2010s when he had an idiosyncratic vendetta and went around town saying “Michael Palin’s travel show” and then yawning, which a small niche found rather tickling.
It would be fair to say it’s not a recent body of comic work that has recommended Cleese for a Channel 4 show about “cancel culture”, any more than it is Botham’s sporting career that equips him to be the trade envoy to Australia for “global Britain”. They have been drafted in for the vibes.

A woman and two children have died in a crash involving a motorhome and a lorry.
North Yorkshire police said the 44-year-old woman, a nine-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy were passengers in the grey motorhome which collided with a white HGV on the A64 near York on Tuesday night.

In the milk crate challenge, which recently started on TikTok, participants take on a set of milk crates precariously stacked in the shape of a pyramid, attempt to climb to the top and then back down again without toppling over.

Sharon Graham’s victory to replace Len McCluskey and become the first woman to lead Unite, one of Britain’s most powerful trade unions, may have come as a surprise to many. But not to those who know her determination and fearlessness.
Some say Graham, 51, was written off because she was a woman. Her refusal to bow to pressure to stand down to make way for a leftwing unity candidate, Steve Turner, who was judged most likely to ensure the defeat of the Keir Starmer-supporting Gerard Coyne, earned her “disgraceful” online opprobrium, some of which was unquestionably misogynistic.

                    <span>Hot, arid and dry conditions that fuel extreme wildfires have grown more frequent from Pacific coast to Great Plains
The hot, dry and windy weather conditions fueling the huge wildfires that have besieged the western US this summer have increased in frequency over the past 50 years, a new study has found.
Since 1973, global heating has desiccated the west, driving increases in “fire weather” days from the Pacific coast to the Great Plains, according to research by the non-profit Climate Central. It found that the number of fire weather days increased steeply in parts of Texas and in California’s interior, and that southern Nevada, south-east California and swathes of New Mexico had the highest number of average annual fire weather days – with nearly a quarter of the year in some regions being characterized as having elevated risk.

The past three Ryder Cups have been won by the length of a par five.

More than 2,200 deaths have been recorded so far, while at least 30,000 families have had to abandon their homes. Many were sleeping on the streets when Tropical Storm Grace struck two days later, bringing high winds and pelting rain. But despite the hardship, many Haitians are wary of the massive international aid response that is under way

Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South

I can’t speak for other veterans, but I was never certain of the legitimacy of our presence in Afghanistan. I wanted to believe I was there for the right reasons, namely to help the Afghan people and deter future terror attacks. But the doubts always remained, fuelled by witnessing civilians caught up in exchanges of fire, or seeing eerie ghost towns that had been abandoned after ceaseless violence.
For those who haven’t served in the army, it’s easy to assume soldiers are obedient and unquestioning. Yet as long as combat operations directly involve humans, doubt will always be part of the equation. Questioning the moral objectives of our mission was, for me at least, a necessary precursor to participation.

Afghanistan withdrawal – live updates

The Taliban have captured more than 100 Russian-made helicopters in various states of operability, the head of a Russian state arms exporter has said, but will be largely unable to use them with little access to maintenance crews and spare parts.
As the Taliban overran the Afghan army and took control of large stores of arms and vehicles, it also captured at least 100 Mi-17 Hip helicopters, a Russian-made transport aircraft procured by the US for the Afghan armed forces because it was comparatively cheaper and easier to fly than US-made UH-60 Black Hawks.

In 2011, Sam Fender was, by his own admission, “a little stoner” who had flunked out of his A-Levels in his hometown of North Shields, living with his mother in a flat with black mould on the walls. A decade later, he’s one of the UK’s best and most successful singer-songwriters: his 2019 debut album Hypersonic Missiles went to No 1, he won a Brit award, and his knack for writing songs about 21st-century disaffections marked him out from cheerier peers such as Ed Sheeran and George Ezra. His second album Seventeen Going Under, a superb record that channels the sound of Bruce Springsteen and the War on Drugs into an examination of his family, youth and frailty, is out in October.

Four weeks ago the Biden administration officially began implementing the child tax credit in what was hailed by Columbia University as an initiative that could “cut child poverty in half in the US”. Most eligible families have received just one monthly installment so far – but for many American parents struggling to make ends meet during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, it has already made a huge difference.
The American Rescue Plan – passed in March – included expanded credit payments, which increased from $2,000 in 2020 to $3,600 for each child under age six, and $3,000 for children ages six through 17, this year. The funds are distributed in monthly payments of either $250 or $300 for each child.

Days after the statues of two British monarchs were toppled in the province of Manitoba amid growing fury over the legacy of Canada’s residential school system, where Indigenous children were forcibly sent for much of the 20th century, the website Walking Eagle News had its own take – not so much on the grief and outrage, but on the fixation with statues.
“Country was ‘mere seconds’ from reconciliation before the statue toppled: Manitoba premier,” ran the Walking Eagle News headline.

                    <span>Police forces urged to stay alert to ‘Covid blaming’ as an excuse or defence by suspects

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Coronavirus was “weaponised” by domestic abusers during the pandemic and police forces should remain alert to “Covid blaming” as an excuse or defence by suspects, a study has found.
The Domestic Homicide Project, established by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, revealed that domestic homicides in England and Wales had not increased dramatically during the pandemic but still remained at about three a week, with 163 recorded in the 12 months to March. This was similar to the previous year’s figure of 152 and in line with the 15-year average.

                    <span>He may have backed the world’s most successful rock band, but the late drummer worshipped his jazz heroes through big bands and other projects
Everyone knew that Charlie Watts’s heart was always in jazz. Even when he grew his hair long and put on hippie garb while the Rolling Stones were going through their Satanic Majesties period, underneath he was still the cool bebopper who could see through the nonsense that surrounded his group and the rampaging egos at its heart.
Wisely, he never let his true musical allegiance show in his playing with the Stones. When they recruited him from Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated in January 1963, not long after he’d been serving an apprenticeship with trad jazz bands, he listened to the records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters in order to absorb the way that master Chicago blues drummers such as Earl Phillips, Fred Below and Elgin Evans kept things simple, soon appreciating that simplicity is often the hardest thing of all to achieve.

                    <span>Australians are very protective of their national cake, and with good reason, but who makes the best?
Lamingtons are one of those things, like Tim Tams and toad racing, that are big in Australia but, despite the best efforts of the residents of Ramsay Street, almost unknown elsewhere. Antipodeans of my acquaintance, however, go into nostalgic raptures at the very mention of these little cakes, a staple of Australia Day celebrations and school bake sales. (One friend claims he ate two a day as a child, so he may well be the only person who’s ever lost weight by moving to the UK.)
Said to have been named after – or, by those less familiar with the culinary skills of your average Victorian aristocrat, invented by – a former governor of Queensland, it’s also been appropriated, not uncontroversially, by New Zealand (food writer Irina Georgescu informs me that the same cake is also very popular among the Swabian community in Romania and Germany). Far be it from me, a mere Pom, to comment on the issue, but I will say that whoever came up with them was a clever little sausage.

One night 14 years ago, Hawa Bah crept out of her house in Guinea and slipped into the darkness. She says she had lost count but it may have been her 14th or 15th escape attempt from an abusive marriage she was forced into with a man 37 years her senior.
Bah made her way through a maze of streets to the meeting point where a car was waiting with two strangers inside. When they took her to the airport, Bah felt her heart beating through her chest. She had not realised until then that she would be leaving her country. Aged 17, she had no belongings and no idea where she was going.

Private call centre staff subcontracted to work on Covid test-and-trace services have been advised to limit time away from answering phones to 10 minutes on a six-hour shift and told they might not be paid for breaks, the Guardian has learned.
The workers, who answer calls from home for the government’s 119 Covid number, have to select “comfort break” on their computer before using the toilet and are told to minimise time spent on such absences, or on fetching food or drink, or praying.

                    <span>By boosting dominant species such as great tits, human-provided food can make life harder for many woodland birds
Feeding birds is hard-wired into our national psyche. The apocryphal Victorian “tuppence a bag” for seed for the Trafalgar Square pigeons has morphed into a national pastime, with an estimated 17m households spending £250m a year on more than 150,000 tonnes of bird feed – enough to feed the entire breeding population of the 10 most common feeder-using bird species year-round three times over.
The habit has been enthusiastically encouraged by environmental NGOs, which recognise it as a way for people to connect with nature. This was brought into sharp relief during the pandemic, with many of us discovering the joy of attracting birds to our own gardens after losing access to wildlife and wild spaces. So we know that bird-feeding can be good for humans, but what about for birds?

The former European Union trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, has warned Australia is becoming “more and more isolated” on climate action at a time when floods, fires, droughts, and the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows global heating “is created by humanity”.
Malmström told a webinar hosted by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute on Wednesday climate change was “the most urgent global crisis we are finding ourselves in – and we don’t have much time”.

Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on one of rock music’s most iconic album covers – Nevermind by Nirvana – is suing the band, claiming he was sexually exploited as a child.
In a lawsuit filed in a Californian district court against numerous parties, including the surviving members of the band, Kurt Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, and the record labels that released or distributed the album in the last three decades, Elden alleges the defendants produced child pornography with the image, which features him swimming naked towards a dollar bill with his genitalia visible.

                    <span>Feline fancies began in the UK in 1871, with proud cat owners grabbing the chance to show off their perfect pets. What is the secret of their enduring appeal?
The air in the sports centre has a base note of urine. A soundtrack of plaintive mewling is interrupted occasionally by the sharp scratch of a hiss. Humans dart around the floor, attending to the whims of their lusciously furred, bouffant companions. Hairbrushes are wielded; coats are teased to 80s volumes. Over the PA system, an announcement is made. “Long-haired kittens are required in ring five!”
The first cat show took place in Crystal Palace, south-east London, in 1871. I have come to the LondonCats Worldwide (LCWW) 150th anniversary celebration show. Over two days, 200 competitors will converge on the Crystal Palace national sports centre, cat carriers in hand. In six rings along one wall of the show floor, judges will assess each animal for temperament, condition and conformity to the breed standard, before an audience of paying spectators.

                    <span>As the pandemic drives calls for a radical overhaul of the food system, can the president take on the meat giants?
Both the planet and US politics have heated up in tandem over recent decades, but few sectors have stewed in controversy quite like America’s beef industry. Four super-powered meatpackers control more than 80% of the US beef market, an extraordinary concentration of market power that the Biden administration is not happy about. 
A recent executive action signed by the president aims to increase competition in the beef industry, with the White House noting that, over the past five years, “farmers’ share of the price of beef sales has dropped by more than a quarter – from 51.5% to 37.3% – while the price of beef has risen”. 
But how were the big four meatpackers able to capture so much of the US beef processing capacity? They had help.

                    <span>Today the media are looking for scapegoats, but 20 years ago they helped facilitate the disastrous intervention
Everyone is to blame for the catastrophe in Afghanistan, except the people who started it. Yes, Joe Biden screwed up by rushing out so chaotically. Yes, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab failed to make adequate and timely provisions for the evacuation of vulnerable people. But there is a frantic determination in the media to ensure that none of the blame is attached to those who began this open-ended war without realistic aims or an exit plan, then waged it with little concern for the lives and rights of the Afghan people: the then US president, George W Bush, the British prime minister Tony Blair and their entourages.
Indeed, Blair’s self-exoneration and transfer of blame to Biden last weekend was front-page news, while those who opposed his disastrous war 20 years ago remain cancelled across most of the media. Why? Because to acknowledge the mistakes of the men who prosecuted this war would be to expose the media’s role in facilitating it.

                    <span>Violence, when it happens, is clumsy and banal. The possibility of a repeat kicking lurked around every corner and the hometown I loved was cast in sinister hues
The first time I was beaten up in the street I was 16 and had intervened when a boy tried to throw a friend of mine through a shop window. The third time, I had my nose broken at 2am in Luton for laughing when three jeering lads called me “John Travolta” (a reference to Grease, presumably; I was going through a big Rocket From The Crypt phase).
But the second time was the most significant. It was 1993, the summer before I failed my A-levels majestically, and two friends, D and M, and I were stumbling home several miles from a Durham nightclub (whose door was run by a young Dominic Cummings) back to our estate outside a north-east town. We were innocent indie kids; we played in punk bands, changed hairstyles regularly and took absolutely nothing seriously save for books, music and high times. We were not fighters. Life was for laughing at.

Did I detect a note of concern in her voice? You know, I believe I did.

                    <span>Fashion and beauty expert David Yi has written a book that reveals how prejudice has kept men’s beauty routines hidden
The history of the male beauty ritual has been largely undocumented – and forgotten about – due to a combination of gender prejudice and misogyny, according to a new book by David Yi, writer and founder of the gender-inclusive skincare website Very Good Light. “For centuries, it is as if speaking about a king’s cosmetics predilections or a famed ruler’s aesthetics meant they were feminine which meant them being less powerful,” he says. 
The author of Pretty Boys: Legendary Icons Who Redefined Beauty concludes that history omits the grooming rituals of leaders and rulers in an attempt to put a modern, heteronormative-filter on the past. Yi says: “Many historians are fearful that the men they have studied and revered would be stripped of their dignity, or perhaps even deemed less powerful, if it was discovered that they wore makeup or had a passion for being pretty.”

Lucy Dawson was skating through life. Everything came so easily to her: she had friends, confidence, academic success. At the age of 20, she was studying criminology at the University of Leicester, determined to join the police. Then, in the summer of 2016, she got a terrible headache that refused to go away.
The headache was to change Dawson’s life. It took almost four months for her to be diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the brain that leaves many people with permanent brain damage and has a mortality rate of about one in 10. She was showing classic symptoms of encephalitis from the off (confusion, personality change, hallucinations and the headaches) which should have been spotted within a couple of days.

The Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo tells Rachel Humphreys about the trial against the ’Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia syndicate who are Italy’s most powerful organised crime group. The trial has 900 witnesses testifying against more than 350 people, including politicians and officials charged with being members of the syndicate.

                    <span>Stanford University research estimates that smoky California air may have resulted in as many as 7,000 preterm births
As California wildfires continue to rage and the Lake Tahoe area faces some of the highest air pollution levels in the world, a new study has found that breathing wildfire smoke during pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth.
The study from Stanford University, published in Environmental Research this month, estimates that the effects of wildfire smoke may have resulted in as many as 7,000 extra preterm births in California between 2007 and 2012.

US vice-president Kamala Harris’ trip from Singapore to Vietnam was delayed by several hours on Tuesday by an investigation into two possible cases of the so-called Havana syndrome in Hanoi, administration officials said.
The investigation was in its early stages and officials deemed it safe for Harris to make her scheduled stop in Vietnam, which is part of her trip across Asia meant to reassure allies about American foreign policy amid the tumultuous evacuation of US forces from Afghanistan.

The number of young adults who smoke in England rose by about a quarter in the first lockdown, research has suggested.
Nevertheless, the number of people who stopped smoking altogether increased, with the number across all age groups almost doubling during the first national lockdown when compared with the period immediately prior, researchers from University College London (UCL) and the University of Sheffield said.

Since the DOJ unveiled the corruption probe in 2015, more than 50 defendants have been criminally charged. Twenty seven people and four corporate entities have pleaded guilty, and two people were convicted at trial.

Unwanted wool from lambs reared by farmers in Wales and south-west England for Waitrose is being turned into environmentally friendly mattresses for John Lewis.
Waitrose said farmers were struggling to find buyers for their wool, with the price paid often not even covering shearing costs, leading to the material sometimes being burned or buried. The tough market conditions have been made worse by the pausing of exports to China, a key buyer, during the pandemic.

Playwright Frances Poet nimbly entwines Sophia Jex-Blake’s groundbreaking battles with the story of her “official” biography in this audio play, part of the Sound Stage series by Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh.

In a move likely to fuel criticism that America is abandoning Afghan partners to the Taliban, the US president made clear that he is resolved to withdraw forces from Kabul airport by next Tuesday’s deadline.

In the wake of her breakthrough Wimbledon, this has been the challenge before Emma Raducanu as she has spent the past few weeks travelling around the United States and playing to crowds a fraction of Court One’s capacity. So far, she has thrived.

Mbappé has only one year of his contract remaining

Paris Saint-Germain are considering a €160m (£137m) bid from Real Madrid for Kylian Mbappé, with the France forward hoping to seal a move to the Spanish giants.
The 22-year-old has less than a year remaining on his contract in the French capital having turned down more than three different proposals from PSG to extend it over recent months. Despite the arrival of Lionel Messi from Barcelona, Mbappé has made it clear that he would like to move to La Liga after signing from Monaco on an initial season-long loan in 2017 before joining permanently for £165.7m a year later.

Britain’s evacuation from Kabul is expected to end within “24 to 36 hours”, potentially abandoning thousands of Afghans, defence sources said as the increasingly bullish Taliban moved to prevent them travelling to the airport to flee.
The US president, Joe Biden, rejected pleas from the UK for the humanitarian airlift to continue beyond 31 August at a virtual meeting of G7 leaders on Tuesday, triggering claims from Conservative MPs that the “special relationship” is over and that US-UK relations were “about to enter their lowest point since Suez”.

Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies aged 80
A life in pictures
Obituary

By any standards, Charlie Watts was an unlikely candidate for rock stardom.
He was quiet, drily funny and unfailingly modest, characteristics theoretically better suited to his initial profession as a graphic designer than the scream-rent world of 60s pop. Furthermore, by his own admission, he didn’t particularly care for rock’n’roll (“I didn’t know anything about it … I used to hate Elvis Presley. Miles Davis – that’s what I considered someone,” he told an interviewer in 1993) and had initially had to have the rhythm and blues so beloved of his bandmates explained to him: “I didn’t know what it was. I thought it meant Charlie Parker, played slow”.

Premier League backs stance in defiance of Fifa

Premier League clubs have united in defiance of Fifa and refused to release players for international duty in countries on the UK’s red list.
The escalating row over quarantine restrictions, and the lack of exemptions for players returning from red‑zone countries, led to Premier League clubs “reluctantly but unanimously” deciding to take action at a meeting on Tuesday. The Premier League, which has backed the clubs’ stance, has also registered its concern at Fifa’s decision to allow Conmebol teams to play three fixtures in the next two international breaks.

After a shaky start, this spooky tale gets smarter and scarier as the night goes on, cleverly entwining local history and folklore
A hefty storm is brewing outside a ramshackle office on the isle of Guernsey, carrying with it stories of ghosts and ghouls. Written by James Milton and Paul Morrissey, with localised stories of whispers in tunnels and faces in forests, When Darkness Falls smartly entwines history and folklore. After a shaky start, this is a show that gets smarter and scarier as the night goes on.
Working for the Guernsey Historical Society, John (Will Barton) has stayed late to record a vlog with a writer and paranormal researcher (Alex Phelps). Looking back on the ghost stories that haunt the ancient island, the writer tells John five stories, testing his lack of belief with tales of witches, apparitions and unresolved revenge.

As revealed on Monday by the Guardian, Tom Harrison and Sanjay Patel are among a group of leading executives at the England and Wales Cricket Board due to share a £2.1m payout when a five-year Long Term Incentive Plan matures in 2022.

Trustees of Morrisons’ pension schemes have broken cover to warn that a £7bn private equity takeover threatens to “materially weaken” their financial position, and demanded additional security over some of the supermarket’s assets.
Last week the Morrisons board agreed a debt-fuelled £7bn takeover by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, in the latest round in a fierce fight for control of the country’s fourth largest supermarket chain. The 285p-per-share offer trumped that of a rival suitor, Fortress.

Britain’s economy has been plunged into a supply chain crisis, with major retailers’ stock levels at their the lowest since 1983 as a result of worker shortages and transport disruption caused by Covid and Brexit.
In a development that suggests recovery from the pandemic could be at risk, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said stock levels in relation to expected sales fell to their lowest level in August since it began tracking retail industry trends almost four decades ago.

Protesters swooped on Cambridge Circus, in the heart of the capital’s theatre district, just after 3pm. Police managed to encircle gear brought in by activists, holding the middle of road as protesters danced around them to music from a mobile sound system.

Several UK energy suppliers have said they will raise the price of their standard gas and electricity tariffs to the maximum limit set by the energy regulator for the coming winter.
Ofgem’s price cap will climb to its highest level since it was introduced in early 2019 owing to a surge in global gas market prices. The regulator said that for 11 million households who pay by direct debit, energy bills would increase from an average of £1,138 a year to £1,277 from October.

                    <span>Ordinary Afghans will pay the highest price for the west’s defeated ambitions
It speaks volumes about the world today that a US president was more worried about the Taliban looking weak than about his western allies. Britain, France and Germany asked Joe Biden to continue evacuating civilians from Kabul past his self-imposed deadline of 31 August. But the US rejected these requests. Mr Biden wanted to end the chaotic TV scenes from Afghanistan that hurt his domestic poll ratings. But he also accepted that Kabul’s new rulers could not afford to look weak in front of their rival Isis, which is looking for an opportunity to embarrass its Taliban peer.
The west’s airlift will therefore be over by next Tuesday. It is the Afghan people who will pay the highest price for the west’s defeated ambitions for their country. They now face living under Taliban rule for a second time. There is no guarantee that a grinding civil war is over. The scale of the west’s failure is not just that the world’s biggest economies will almost certainly fail to evacuate all those who were employed by its armies and diplomats. It is that we have let down a generation of urban Afghans, especially women, who grew up believing that their lives would be better than their parents’.

                    <span>An embattled democracy’s struggles are not a priority for its western allies
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, could be forgiven for cursing his luck as the country celebrates the 30th anniversary of its independence from the former Soviet Union. On Tuesday, Mr Zelenskiy presided over a military parade in Kiev, attended by an impressive array of dignitaries and heads of state. But in a week when he hoped to concentrate the minds of western allies on Russian bullying and intransigence, their focus is firmly on Afghanistan.
The struggle to stay on the diplomatic radar has become a familiar one. On Monday, Ukraine held an attention-seeking summit on Crimea, illegally annexed by Vladimir Putin in March 2014. The European Union, with which Ukraine signed an association agreement months later, imposed sanctions, and refuses to recognise the territory as part of Russia. At the summit, the European council president, Charles Michel, promised that the EU would continue to “stand tall” against such violations of international law. But in truth, the Russian annexation is a fait accompli that no one now expects to be reversed. Sending late apologies, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel failed to appear at the event.

                    <span>Britain’s armed forces are dodging responsibility for failings in Afghanistan and Iraq, argues Prof Paul Dixon. RC Pennington fears military history is doomed to repeat itself.  Plus letters from Margaret Phelps, Diana Francis and Jim Golcher
Simon Akam is right, the military does want to ignore its failure in Afghanistan (Britain’s military will want to ignore its failure in Afghanistan. It must face reality, 22 August), but it does so by deflecting responsibility on to the politicians.
There is also a strong reluctance to publish books and articles that are critical of the military, even by those who served. All three books cited by Akam are by journalists who are ex-military.

In Italy, mandatory Covid tests required for travel have a fixed price of €15 set by the government, with a result provided within 20 minutes (Cowboy’ providers could lose approval to sell PCR travel tests, 23 August). This is a sensible and fair approach that is helping lead the tide of optimism in Italy. Perhaps it has something to do with the country’s health minister being so appropriately named Bob Hope (Roberto Speranza).

• “Research … does not suggest a direct correlation between the rises in gun sales and violence” (Editorial, 22 August). I don’t think I have ever read anything so ridiculous. Does the proliferation of mobile phones not lead to more phone use? If spoons were substituted for guns, I guarantee there will be less deaths but more spoon-related attacks.

                    <span>Arsenal manager urges supporters to get behind the team
Arteta’s side face trips to West Brom and Manchester City

Mikel Arteta has admitted turning Arsenal’s fortunes around will “take some time” and urged supporters to get behind the team when they travel to West Brom in the Carabao Cup tonight before facing Manchester City on Saturday.
The 2-0 home defeat against Chelsea on Sunday left Arsenal without a point or goal from their opening two Premier League matches to increase the pressure on Arteta after failing to qualify for European competition last season. That meant Arsenal enter the League Cup at the second-round stage for the first time since 1995.

One year later, Neil is deciding whether to return from a two-month holiday to a channel that, in his absence, has not only promoted Farage to be its star presenter but is rebuilding much of the rest of its schedule in the image of the Brexit party founder.

The return of Test cricket to Headingley after a two-year absence is bound to bring memories of Ben Stokes and that remarkable Ashes Sunday flooding back, be it the Western Terrace erupting after the winning runs were thrashed through cover or the sight of Australia’s cricketers collapsing to the ground in disbelief.
But while England’s predicament for the third Test against India, which starts today, is similar to the one faced before the all-rounder’s miraculous intervention in 2019 – sitting 1-0 down to the tourists, and in danger of surrendering their chances of a series win – times have certainly changed, most notably in regard to the players present.

Britain was not expelled from the European Union, although some of the dismay at the consequences of Brexit would make more sense in that scenario. Customs checks at the border are likened to a blockade. Rules that apply to all non-EU countries are described as punishment beatings. The expectation that Boris Johnson uphold the treaty he signed is cast as unreasonable spite.
This is all consistent with the sacred rule of English Euroscepticism, according to which “Europe” must always be understood in terms of things done to us by them; never things we do to ourselves.

                    <span>It nurtured the likes of Helen Mirren and Zawe Ashton but its headquarters were cramped and miserable. Now a revamp has added a touch of Broadway glamour to the famous institution
A pink neon sign glows beneath a light-studded ceiling in the new entrance lobby of the National Youth Theatre, bringing a touch of Broadway glamour to the Holloway Road. Projecting out on to the pavement, occupying what was once a grotty car park on this busy London street, the new pavilion provides a suitably theatrical welcome to the revamped home for the institution – which had been all but invisible until now.
“Even one of the local councillors didn’t know we were here,” says the NYT’s artistic director, Paul Roseby. “Our sign was hidden behind the trees, the front door was always closed and people were shuffled in through a side entrance into a miserable lift lobby. Everything about the place was unwelcoming.”
After a £4m makeover, led by architects DSDHA, it’s now impossible to miss it. Clad in glossy green glazed bricks, oozing the jovial civic air of a Victorian pub, the new structure houses a community studio right on the street, with big shop windows giving passersby a glimpse of the action inside. “All we’re missing is a Hollywood-style Walk of Fame,” says Roseby. “One day I hope we’ll have stars in the pavement between here and the Odeon.”

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

An army of volunteers could be needed this winter to tackle rising staff shortages in care homes fuelled by the looming requirement for all care home workers to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, providers have said.
As the health secretary, Sajid Javid, urged care workers to book their jabs in time to meet the 11 November deadline for all staff in registered care homes in England to be fully vaccinated, the Independent Care Group said operators could be forced to hand back contracts to councils or close care homes and relocate residents because of a staffing crisis, exacerbated by ongoing vaccine hesitancy among a minority of staff. It is leading calls for retired nurses, doctors, carers, to be trained and DBS-checked to fill vacancies in case of a feared “winter meltdown” in staff numbers.

It was a different kind of airport though, one of sweeping colour, soft purples and greens, one awash with music and a place which gave flight to themes of creativity, endeavour and possibility. It also had 380 volunteers dressed in hats with big purple propellers on them, and you don’t get that at London Luton.

                    <span>Inspired by a Guardian article, the theatre’s surreal and spellbinding show AI is a collaboration between humans and the system GPT-3
Last autumn, a deep-learning computer programme wrote an essay for the Guardian. The GPT-3 system argued that humans had nothing to fear from robots. Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, read it and felt inspired. Could there be a future in creative collaboration between AI and humans? If AI could write an article, could it create a play too, in real time, before an audience?
The Young Vic’s new show, AI, explores these questions, casting the same technology as its virtual star. The production is not so much a piece of theatre as dramaturgy, rehearsal and workshop all in one, and contains its own riveting meta drama: a play is constructed over multiple evenings, culminating in a short show that combines human direction and performance with machine imagination and stagecraft (the use of algorithms to create its soundtrack, for example).

                    <span>Some experts fear climate crisis is leading creatures back to area where they were hunted almost to extinction
Blue whales, the world’s largest mammals, are returning to Spain’s Atlantic coast after an absence of more than 40 years.
The first one was spotted off the coast of Galicia in north-west Spain in 2017 by Bruno Díaz, a marine biologist who is head of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute in O Grove, Galicia.

                    <span>The leaked Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was the latest in a long line of early sneak peeks that have helped certain films create or sustain buzz
Social media platforms were buzzing on Monday after a post emerged that appeared to show the trailer for Marvel’s much-anticipated Spider-Man: No Way Home. Despite the poor quality of the clip, which seems to be filming a phone playing the watermarked trailer, fans across the world squinted at the footage to ascertain what lies ahead for Tom Holland’s Peter Parker as he appeared to encounter Doctor Strange, and some faces from the past. It was catnip for Spidey followers, who had become frustrated with the lack of promotional material for a film that is less than four months from cinemas. It has also been the subject of furious speculation, as Marvel’s multiverse arc opens the possibility of several Spider-men crossing paths.

House sales tumbled by almost two-thirds in July after tens of thousands of homebuyers rushed to complete their purchases in order to beat Rishi Sunak’s end-of-June stamp duty holiday deadline.
Following a record surge in activity in June, when 213,370 UK homes changed hands, transactions slumped 62% to 82,110 in July according to official data, after the government scaled back its tax break for buyers in England and Northern Ireland.

                    <span>Watching the Paralympics, we will witness that rare thing: disabled people who have the right support and funding

The Paralympics begins this week, and we’re about to see some fantastic sport, from Ellie Simmonds in the pool to Sarah Storey in the velodrome. But, unfortunately, we’re also about to hear lots of cringe-worthy takes on disability.
The most jarring opinion I have repeatedly come across online is the idea, rooted in the “disabled shirker” narrative, that Paralympic athletes represent what all disabled people could achieve if they just applied themselves. If Hannah Cockroft can wheel 100m in 17.42 seconds, then surely the rest of us can at least make our way to a job interview?

                    <span>Hasan Piker, a leftwing commentator with a huge online following, has attracted criticism after buying an expensive new home. But shouldn’t the left be concentrating on other things, such as getting into power?
Hasan Piker, AKA Hasan the Hun, AKA “woke bae”, has bought a house. If you’re extremely online then you’ll know exactly what this means and already have a strong opinion about it. If you are a normal, well-adjusted, human being then you will have no idea what I’m talking about. So, in brief: Piker is a 30-year-old dude who has gained a massive following through leftwing political commentary on the streaming service Twitch. Spending several hours a day ranting about politics on the internet hasn’t just earned him more than a million followers, it’s also made him a lot of money: Piker has just bought a $2.7m (£1.9m) house with a swimming pool in West Hollywood. Cue screams of “class traitor” and “hypocrite!”
Piker’s new pad has drawn a lot of criticism from fans who think he has betrayed his socialist values. It has also drawn predictable ire from the rightwing media, who have used the story to try to prove socialists don’t have any values. There is nothing conservatives love more than an opportunity to write a story along the lines of “FRAUD: self-proclaimed socialist buys something!” They seem to think that you can’t possibly critique capitalism if you own any sort of property. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example has been criticised by rightwing commentators for owning a nice jacket and a Tesla; Bernie Sanders has been slammed for owning three houses; Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter and self-described Marxist, has been dubbed a hypocrite for buying multiple houses.

Several students and members of staff experienced nausea and some watched their arms or legs turn blue after using kitchen facilities and a drinks machine at the university’s Institute of Materials Science on Monday, Hesse state police reported.

What’s the secret to great Spanish cooking?
Neil, Richmond
To read a list of Spanish pantry staples is to feel instantly hungry. Extra-virgin olive oil, salt and sherry vinegar, as Andalusian master chef Dani García of Bibo in London points out, make an excellent gazpacho dressing, and are also the foundational trio of Spanish cuisine. To these, add aromatics: white onion (for sweetness), lots of garlic, pimentón (smoked paprika) and saffron, the latter both in moderation.

                    <span>Musically-minded villain doesn’t really make this a feminist film, or bring much coherence to the mayhem she orchestrates
Another entry to chalk up in the neo-giallo wave currently being led by Prano Bailey-Bond’s Censor, this also flips the misogynistic precepts of the genre – in this case making the murderous point of view very much female. Kamia Benge plays music student Alexis, a young deaf girl who is far from being traumatised by an incident of terrible violence in her home, and instead finds that a meat tenderiser’s squelchy impact causes her to see a constellation of hallucinogenic lights – along presumably all the feels.
Years later, her hearing returned, Alexis (now played by Jasmin Savoy Brown) and fellow student Marie (Lili Simmons) are recording in an S&amp;M dungeon when the flesh-strikes start tickling her dormant synaesthesia – and she tries pushing the gimp beyond his limits. Out walking one night on a break from her music, Alexis shoves a street harasser in front of an SUV – causing a full-on multi-coloured synaptic big bang. Sensing the possibilities, this uncompromising avant-gardist decides to take her musically motivated pain infliction much further, giving new meaning to the term sick beats.

                    <span>There was no need to put a rocket under the housing market. The consequences are now all too clear
Rishi Sunak’s approval ratings tell their own story. The chancellor’s stock is high, because the Treasury’s furlough scheme has limited the job losses from the pandemic. But while Sunak has had a much better crisis than some of his colleagues, his record is far from flawless.
Two errors of judgment stick out: the “eat out to help out” discounts for diners, blamed for a wave of infections last autumn, and the decision to raise the threshold on stamp duty for home purchases in England and Northern Ireland from £125,000 to £500,000.

I am disappointed to note that a certain mirth has attended the news that Beefy Botham has been made a UK trade envoy. There seems to be some sense that his lordship is not up to the job, despite being a former cricketer with his own wine range, and despite the position of trade envoy being one that even Prince Andrew could manage for many years.
Not that Beefy has stepped directly into Andrew’s sweat-free shoes – Lord Botham’s appointment is Australia-specific, announced on Monday by pitilessly bubbly trade secretary Liz Truss. As she put it, “Ian will bat for business Down Under” – a statement that underscored the fact that if cliches were trade, Liz would be running a huge surplus. Alas, not everyone is as meaninglessly upbeat as her. (They couldn’t be: it requires suspending all critical faculties in the service of positioning oneself as the sort of glass-half-full person who would make a nice badminton partner or chancellor of the exchequer to a man who can’t bear bad news.)

“Our catchphrase was, ‘What are they going to do, sack us?’” says Adam Hills. “We were only meant to be on air for 10 days, so we were happy to push boundaries. Little did we suspect we’d still be here nine years later.”
The Last Leg started life as a Paralympics spin-off to highlight Channel 4’s coverage of the 2012 London games. Host Hills called it “Three guys with four legs discussing the day” – he was born without a right foot, while sidekick Alex Brooker had his twisted right leg amputated when he was a baby.

                    <span>Online communities are not just used for propaganda but are valuable fundraising tools and crucial to recruitment
The Taliban took over Afghanistan in two weeks, ending 20 years of fighting with western troops and the Afghan national army. Many factors, such as a problematic peace deal, a lack of political will among the former Kabul administration to fight the Taliban and rampant corruption contributed to the group’s rapid advance and the fall of Kabul – but notable among them was a successful modern media strategy.
Prior to 2001 the Taliban banned the use of the internet, dismantled state-run television stations, ordered citizens to stop watching TV altogether and banned music. But after they had been ousted by international forces, the group rapidly expanded its online presence, starting in 2003 with a new insurgency. They launched a new radio station called Voice of Sharia, which had its own website, Al Emarah. Despite numerous attempts to block and remove it, Al Emarah has remained the official website of the Taliban. The site primarily contains battlefield news and videos, as well as the Taliban’s official statements. In the aftermath of their defeat, the Taliban focused their efforts on reviving the group online, “a virtual emirate”, as one scholar called it.

                    <span>Spotted lanternflies are eating crops of apples, grapes and hops, and destroying native trees such as maple, walnut and willow
The official public guidance is simple and to the point: “Kill it! Squash it, smash it … just get rid of it!”
Such is the threat posed by a summer invasion of troublesome spotted lanternfly insects in the north-east that Pennsylvania’s department of agriculture has resorted to the unorthodox language in its advice on dealing with the pest.

                    <span>When I booked a solo hiking trip in the Canary Islands, I expected breathtaking scenery – not a terrifying panic attack
After watching Pedro Almodóvar’s Broken Embraces, which draws heavily on the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, I was determined to visit. A Google image search of the island made my head fizz: black sand beaches, alien-green ponds, mountains, great pyramids of ochre dirt and dead lava. In the summer of 2016, I finally booked a solo hiking trip there to mark the completion of my first book, Anxiety for Beginners. It was breathtaking, in all kinds of ways.
In the excitement of having written a book, the difficult experiences I had reflected upon in my childhood and teen years (a near-fatal illness and quite a difficult home life) had begun to feel a little academic – I wasn’t connecting to the person I had talked about on the page. I realised it wasn’t just the content of the book I had needed to process, but where I was in my life.

Halve and stone 400g of ripe apricots. Top and tail 200g of blackcurrants and add them to the apricots. Finely grate a small lemon over the fruit and toss gently to mix. Break 4 eggs into a jug blender or food processor, then add 75g of plain flour, 85g of caster sugar, 250ml of double cream and 225ml of full-cream milk. Process briefly, just enough to mix the ingredients together.

                    <span>Lockdown or no lockdown, the video-call date is here to stay. Experts reveal how to look your best, keep the conversation flowing and turn that online spark into a face-to-face meeting
As if first dates aren’t awkward enough, along comes video dating to add an extra layer of tech frustration and misinterpreted body language to the mix. During lockdown, video calls – either within a dating app, or on platforms such as Zoom – took off. But as restrictions lift, many dating experts predict the format is here to stay – or at least that it has become a helpful additional step. Dating apps rolled out video call functions last year, and Hinge found that 65% of people who had been on a virtual date planned to continue post-pandemic. Of Tinder’s younger users (Generation Z daters, in their late teens and early 20s), half have used video dating. So you may as well perfect your on-screen hairstyle, decide what to wear on your upper half and embrace it. Here are some tips on how to succeed.

In 2010, the One Million Trees initiative was announced by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai. The aim of the launch was to increase green areas in Dubai through afforestation, while contributing to overall beautification of the city.

During months of lockdown, homeworking and homeschooling, many families have relied on screens to teach and entertain their children during the pandemic.
We’re interested to hear from parents about their children’s screen time: Has the time your child spends in front of screens increased since the pandemic began, and if so, how do you feel about it? Do you think this has affected their behaviour or development? Are you glad about the myriad forms of entertainment and learning screens can offer, or do you wish your child spent less time in front of a screen?

Dame Zandra Rhodes has announced she had designed a line of homeware products for the Swedish furniture chain, a decision she made after painting her Billy bookcase “an iridescent Frida Kahlo blue”.

                    <span>The San Onofre nuclear power plant shut down years ago – but residents and experts worry what will happen with the waste left behind
More than 2 million visitors flock each year to California’s San Onofre state beach, a dreamy slice of coastline just north of San Diego. The beach is popular with surfers, lies across one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the Unites States and has a 10,000-year-old sacred Native American site nearby. It even landed a shout-out in the Beach Boys’ 1963 classic Surfin’ USA.
But for all the good vibes and stellar sunsets, beneath the surface hides a potential threat: 3.6m lb of nuclear waste from a group of nuclear reactors shut down nearly a decade ago. Decades of political gridlock have left it indefinitely stranded, susceptible to threats including corrosion, earthquakes and sea level rise.

The mobile phones of nine Bahraini activists, including two who were granted asylum protection and are now living in London, were hacked between June 2020 and February 2021 using NSO Group spyware, according to new findings by researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.
A report due to be released on Tuesday will reveal that the hacked activists, some of whose phones were being monitored by Citizen Lab researchers at the time they were hacked, include three members of Waad, a secular leftwing political group that was suspended in 2017 amid a crackdown on peaceful dissent in Bahrain.

British tourists face difficulties in proving their vaccine status in Europe following a delay in linking the NHS Covid pass to the EU’s system due to gaps in the British government’s application to Brussels.
An IT tie-up would ensure automatic recognition across the 27 member states of the information held on the NHS app, facilitating both international travel and access to hospitality where proof of vaccine status is required.

In recent years, Love Island has become as ingrained in the British calendar as April showers in spring, and that sludgy stuff that appears in the road when cars drive over fallen leaves in autumn. Love Island is summer, summer is Love Island and – as all seasonal phenomena must – it drew to a close last night. Deflate your novelty doughnut-shaped rubber ring; hang your bikini over a chair to finally dry.
The thing about events that come around every year, however, is that while they’re sometimes comforting, they can also be boring. Last night, denied of the banter outcome (that is, a win by Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran, a couple with the delightful, fizzy energy of two Beroccas dissolving in the same glass), we instead looked on politely as Liam Reardon and Millie Court were crowned the winners of Love Island 2021, the prosaic prom king and queen of the villa.

                    <span>Covid and the boom in streaming platforms are being touted as a huge threat to cinema-going. But so was telly. And surely we’re all desperate to leave the house and make a big social occasion of it all?
So are we in or out? Is this going to be the old normal or some new normal that the business still hasn’t yet grasped? As we look forward to what’s on offer in cinemas this autumn, we see new films mixed in with a deja-vu raft of old product delayed from the distant “before times” of pre-Covid. These films are beginning to feel like pizzas removed from the freezer cabinet, thawed out, and then unhygienically put back in the freezer. And of course we are all still absorbing the fact that Covid conforms neither to the accepted news cycles or movie distribution release structures. There could still be a fourth or a fifth wave. Cinemas could still be shut down again.
Covid might have changed the movie world temporarily or permanently or not at all, but as we fret fruitlessly about the discomfort of wearing masks in cinemas, the revolution could have already arrived in the new economy of streaming – which had been changing the game anyway.

Margie remains completely still. Around her in the sun-dappled woods, six dogs catch her scent and begin to circle. She pulls her head and legs inside her shell and hinges it shut, tight as a trap, but the dogs are clearly professionals.
Ruger, a one and a half year old Boykin spaniel, prevails. He clamps his jaws around Margie’s shell and carries the 25-year-old eastern box turtle like a trophy to the feet of turtle tracker John Rucker.

This law follows earlier restrictions by Viktor Orbán&#x27;s government on trans rights and adoption by gay parents. Patrik and Zsolt think gay people are the latest scapegoats for the governing Fidesz party, but Budapest&#x27;s Pride parade is an opportunity to protest against the new laws and to rally support.

                    <span>Laws intended to tackle child abuse are resulting in young men in consensual relationships being imprisoned. Activists argue a more nuanced approach is needed
Mani*, 21, began dating Noor*, 17, two years ago. They couldn’t see each other during the Covid lockdowns, but when restrictions began to ease, they would meet on the deserted banks of a canal in a small town in Tamil Nadu. The couple hoped to marry one day, but then Noor fell pregnant, and life turned into a nightmare.
Two months ago, Mani was charged with rape under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) law. After 48 days in jail, he was released on bail. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment.

Planting trees without plastic tree guards should be standard practice, a UK study has found, as leading conservation charities and landowners seek sustainable alternatives to reduce plastic waste.
The Woodland Trust has announced it is aiming to stop using plastic tree guards by the end of the year. It is trialling plastic-free options at its Avoncliff site in Wiltshire, including cardboard and British wool. The charity plans to plant 10 million trees each year until 2025.

Not too long ago, Pakistan and Afghanistan were called Af-Pak: two countries joined at the hip, doomed to live and die together. You didn’t get to choose your neighbours, we were told. Geography, we were taught, was our destiny.
There was a lot of talk about geostrategic significance – which was the Pakistan military’s way of saying there were great advantages to be derived from our unfortunate neighbours.

                    <span>I fell hard for life in the Vosges in France. But when it got dark I couldn’t helped being spooked by every rustle, bark and footstep I heard. Then a night drinking outside changed everything
Eighteen-and-a-bit years ago, pushing 40, tired of England and keen to spend more time with my daughter, who was growing up in France, I packed in my job, left London and moved to the Vosges mountains in the east of the country. It was an idyllic spot: a little stark, vaguely unkempt, full of dark forests, crystalline lakes and gnarled locals with chainsaws in their sheds and bulldozers in their gardens. When they weren’t turning trees into firewood, they were digging out ponds – or possibly graves. In the second world war, they told me, there had been a murder near my home; the killer had buried his victim in a cabbage patch. But I digress.
Home was a draughty stone shack a couple of miles from the nearest village, down a dirt track flanked by spruces and silver birch. My nearest neighbour was a three-minute walk away, and when the birches were in leaf you couldn’t see another house. Indoors, I was plagued by dormice, and a shrew once dropped from the bedroom ceiling. Outside, there were red squirrels, buzzards and small animals that ran and squeaked in the undergrowth all day long. Sometimes I would open my front door to find a doe and her fawns cropping the lawn. I fell hard and fast for the Vosges.

                    <span>Trans children and their families still often face suspicion and suppression, but attitudes are changing
‘My preconceptions about trans people came from the media, and I certainly hadn’t heard of trans children. So it just flummoxed me having an assigned male child who didn’t have especially ‘feminine’ interests and yet was saying consistently, ‘I’m a girl.’”
Kate was telling me about her eldest daughter, Alex. (Names of all trans young people, and of their parents, have been changed for their privacy.) It was a warm July evening, and we were sitting in the kitchen of their family home, in a comfortable British suburb populated by middle-class couples with young families. Alex, still at primary school, is trans. A few years ago, her mum assumed she was a boy who was clumsily trying to ask for typically feminine things. “I remember I used to have conversations with her at a very young age in the car because she’d get really upset. I’d say: ‘But I don’t understand what would be different if you were a girl? What can’t you do that you could do if you were a girl?’ I’d ask: ‘Do you want a doll?’ She’d just reply: ‘I don’t like dolls!’”

Its sturdy presence has threaded through more than 2,000 years of history, fuelled by fans that were said to have ranged from the Carthaginian general Hannibal to Roman legions.
These days, however, the longstanding tradition of swordmaking in the Spanish city of Toledo has dwindled to just two artisan swordmakers – the last living link to a tradition that stretches back millennia.

This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from earlier in the year. This episode was first broadcast on 24 May.
Email and text frauds are nothing new, but with a boom in online shopping during the coronavirus crisis, their anonymous perpetrators have hit on a lucrative twist. Rachel Humphreys hears from Rose, who thought little of filling out a web form to arrange the redelivery of a pot of face cream and set off a chain of events that would wind up with a fraudster emptying her bank account.

New Zealand is bracing for its biggest coronavirus outbreak yet as cases rise, the locations of interest balloon to more than 400 sites, and the number of close contacts swells to 14,000 people.
On Monday, the country recorded 35 positive cases, bringing the total number in its outbreak to 107 – half of whom were Pasifika peoples.

Joe Biden faced mounting pressure at home and abroad on Monday as he raced against time to deal with evacuations from Afghanistan, a surging coronavirus pandemic and a vital congressional vote on his domestic agenda.
The US president’s job approval rating fell below 50% for the first time, according to an NBC News poll, with just 25% approving of his handling of Afghanistan, which was overrun by the Taliban this month far quicker than he predicted.

Texas Republicans brought back their voting bill Monday with no changes as some Democrats returned to the Capitol for the first time since ending their holdout, making it clear that the bill is on track to become law after their 38-day walkout.
Dozens of people showed up to testify before lawmakers to seize their last chance for public input on the the bill that will tighten voting rules in ways the GOP says will ensure election integrity and that Democrats say amounts to voter suppression for disabled people and minorities.

Obesity in women has previously been linked to health problems in their offspring. Among them, studies have suggested women who are overweight when trying to conceive are more likely to have a baby with serious birth defects.

The woman, identified only as “Jane Doe”, said Kelly had once beaten her with a shoe and wept when she also claimed that she had contracted herpes after having sex with him. She said he hadn’t disclosed he had a sexually transmitted disease.

The record-shattering rainfall that caused deadly flooding across Germany and Belgium in July was made up to nine times more likely by the climate crisis, according to research.
The study also showed that human-caused global heating has made downpours in the region up to 20% heavier. The work reinforces the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s landmark report this month that there is “unequivocal” evidence that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause of worsening extreme weather.

Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.

                    <span>The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami is a story that didn’t need to be overdramatised. But Channel 5 appear to have missed the memo with this formulaic, melodramatic mess
The colossal scale of the Boxing Day tsunami – a 9.1 magnitude earthquake under the Indian Ocean displacing 30tn litres of seawater that hit the coasts of mainland Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India in waves that rushed at 500mph – would compel even if it were not for the human catastrophe that accompanied its incomparably destructive force. A quarter of a million people were killed. Entire towns and communities were wiped out. Survivors’ stories are uniformly harrowing.
There have been a number of dramas – most notably the Abi Morgan-scripted miniseries Tsunami, the Aftermath in 2006 – but Channel 5’s three-part film, following the minute-by-minute progression of the tsunami from the moment the two tectonic plates 19 miles under the sea finally ruptured at 7.58am on 26 December 2004, is one of only a few documentaries about it. Dr Xand van Tulleken presents the main thrust of the story – travelling to the affected areas as he outlines the terrifying phenomenon’s journey and interviewing those who were caught up in it. Raksha Dave visits scientists who explain the facts behind the waves’ emergence, evolution and effects.

“Any athlete you talk to, they have resilience,” said Shahrad Nasajpour during a press briefing in Tokyo on Monday. “Part of it comes from the athletic background, so any athlete you talk to they have it. But when you are a refugee athlete or Paralympian, which makes it even harder, the adversity behind makes you more perseverant in your life and in your career.”
Nasajpour, who has cerebral palsy, left his native Iran in 2015 and was granted asylum in the US. He was instrumental in setting up the Paralympic refugee team which competed for the first time in Rio in 2016, and indeed formed 50% of its number. Now, as part of a six-strong team, he will be competing in the F37 discus once again and when the Games get under way in Japan on Tuesday the resilience, perseverance and athletic talent that Nasajpour represents will be the qualities organisers hope to project to a watching world.

                    <span>London Wonderground
Don’t expect the shock of the new from the BBC Radio 4 stalwart, but audience suggestions and music really lift the second half
Is it a live show – or an impersonation of a live show? BBC Radio 4 favourite Dead Ringers takes up residency at the London Wonderground, with a compendium of sketches to tickle their fans. Many have already been broadcast; all are recited script-in-hand. Within those parameters, Duncan Wisbey, Debra Stephenson and Jon Culshaw deliver a likable hour of mimicry, in which the voices are always enjoyable, even when the jokes are uninspired.
Of course, we don’t expect the shock of the new from this 20-year-old institution. If we did, Culshaw’s dress sense – he’s wearing a smoking jacket – would soon disabuse us. Give or take a barbed remark from Wisbey, this is genteel satire-lite that couldn’t be more “Radio 4 comedy” (unreflective, a little pleased with itself, blandly non-partisan) if it tried. The opening stages, parodying the Today programme, are full of predictable news-based gags, making sport of sex-mad Johnson, abnormal Gove and policy-free Starmer. Elsewhere, there’s an off-putting fixation on the idea that Andy Murray is dominated by his mum.

Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11.59pm, just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face an impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations which he denies.

Covid-19 deaths in the UK have reached their highest level since mid-March, data shows. The seven-day average for deaths within 28 days of a positive test now stands at 100, figures released by Public Health England on Monday show, a number that was last exceeded on 18 March.
Tributes to those who have died in the recent wave included some from the family and friends of Samantha Willis, 35, a mother of four from Derry who contracted Covid-19 while heavily pregnant and died 16 days later after having given birth to her daughter Evie Grace.

A Seychelles giant tortoise, a species previously thought to be a strict herbivore, has been filmed chasing and eating a baby bird in a “horrifying and amazing” attack, with researchers stating it was the first documented example of deliberate hunting in the wild by the species. 
The video, taken on Fregate Island in July 2020, shows a female giant tortoise slowly stalking a lesser noddy tern chick, snapping at it unsuccessfully before delivering a lethal bow by clamping its jaws directly around its head.

Tom Harrison and a group of senior executives at the England and Wales Cricket Board are poised to share a projected £2.1m bonus pot despite making 62 job cuts last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The most recent ECB accounts show that a five-year Long-Term Incentive Plan is due to be settled in cash in 2022, with the Guardian having learned that Harrison, the board’s chief executive who was paid £512,000 last year despite a voluntary pay cut, and Sanjay Patel, managing director of the Hundred, are among its intended recipients.

                    <span>Speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival about the scandalous lack of representation and disgraceful conditions my colleagues endure means underlining systemic failures
• Actors told they’re ‘too disabled’ for disabled roles in UK television
I had mixed feelings on being offered the MacTaggart lecture this year. The first was surprise: had anyone ever heard me speak? I once did a Bafta speech that Piers Morgan described on Twitter as the worst in the history of the awards. The second was disbelief that I had been afforded such an honour. The third was a sense of extreme responsibility. I knew it was an opportunity to talk about disability – or the lack of disability – on TV, how television gets key discussions wrong, and how I might dare represent that cause.
The issue of representation has reared its head in the past 10 years in particular. I am not going to use the word diversity because I don’t love the word. Diversity feels celebratory: “Look how diverse we are, aren’t we wonderful.” Representation implies a responsibility. If TV is not representative then it fails. And when it comes to disability, the failure is really stark.

Actors have been told they are “too disabled” to play disabled roles in popular television series, with parts instead going to able-bodied people, according to a leading screenwriter who has called for television companies to adopt quotas for people with disabilities.
Jack Thorne said funding for shows featuring disabled characters is difficult to obtain, disabled writers are regularly unable to attend script meetings because production offices are inaccessible, and recalled the time a friend who uses a wheelchair was forced to crawl along a muddy floor to reach her desk while working on a film shoot.

Ending lockdowns and other public health restrictions once 80% of the adult population is vaccinated could result in 25,000 deaths in total and 270,000 cases of long Covid, new modelling warns.
The work by researchers at three leading Australian universities predicts more than 10 times as many deaths as the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins the national four-phase roadmap. That plan was adopted by national cabinet in July but is subject to different interpretations by state and territory leaders.

                    <span>Lack of planning and coordination has left the west scrambling to do the right thing
At the weekend, in advance of Tuesday’s crisis meeting of G7 leaders, Boris Johnson tweeted that it was vital for the international community to work together to “ensure safe evacuations, prevent a humanitarian crisis and support the Afghan people to secure the gains of the last 20 years”. Had this exhortation been made at June’s G7 summit in Cornwall – when America’s intention to pull out of Afghanistan at reckless speed was already known – it would have been a little more impressive and meaningful.
Delivered belatedly against a backdrop of lethal chaos and confusion at Kabul airport, the prime minister’s words serve only to underline how little planning and coordination took place when both were urgently required. As a result of Joe Biden’s precipitate haste to get the withdrawal over and done with, and the negligent response of allies such as Britain, a humanitarian crisis is already in train. For tens of thousands of justifiably terrified Afghanis, the evacuation process is a dangerous lottery that represents a betrayal of the trust they placed in the west. The “gains of the last 20 years”, such as greater freedoms for women and girls, will now be subject to the internal politics of the Taliban, as it decides which face it wishes to present to the world.

                    <span>The liberalisation of betting has had some damaging effects and the industry should stop denying it
New Labour liberalised gambling in Britain with the 2005 Gambling Act, which introduced one of the most permissive regulatory frameworks in the world. The idea was that more betting would deliver economic benefits, and in one sense it did. The gross take from gambling has nearly doubled, with punters losing £10.2bn a year. The industry’s marketing spend has boomed. And HM Revenue and Customs has gained too: Denise Coates, who runs the Stoke-based gambling giant Bet365, paid £573m in taxes in 2019-20 – over £100m more than anyone else.
But along with the increase in gambling came rises in the harms associated with it. When the legislation was passed, concerns were focused on supercasinos. But what happened, instead of the creation of giant hubs, is that gambling (like so much else) moved online and to smartphones, where in-play betting during the course of a football match or other event became one of the most popular ways to bet. The other big change was the spread of fixed-odds betting terminals, from which gambling companies earned huge amounts: £1.8bn in profits each year until the maximum stake was slashed from £100 to £2 in 2020, following a public outcry and the high-profile resignation of a Conservative minister, Tracey Crouch.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Deaths from Covid-19 are now averaging 100 a day across the UK, according to official data, and scientists have warned that case rates will jump again when millions of pupils return to schools next week.
The seven-day average for deaths within 28 days of a positive test now stands at 100, figures released by Public Health England on Monday show, a number that was last exceeded on 18 March.

Labour has called for an inquiry into allegations that Boris Johnson broke the ministerial code by using a taxpayer-funded plane for a byelection campaign visit.
The claim was prompted by a report saying the Conservative party had not declared any spending relating to travel in the accounts it submitted for the Hartlepool byelection – even though the prime minister flew to the north-east for a visit that involved electioneering.

The long-running battle to build an underground nuclear waste facility in the north of England has run into fresh problems, as communities reacted with shock to the news that they were being considered as locations. 
The north-east port town of Hartlepool is one of the sites in the frame as a potential site for a geological disposal facility (GDF), while a former gas terminal point at Theddlethorpe, near the Lincolnshire coast, is another. Cumbria, where much of the waste is stored above ground, is also being considered.

A little over a month into the resumption of racing with full attendance and the crowd figures, at the sport’s biggest venues at least, are as strong as anyone could have realistically hoped to see. Two major Festivals – Glorious Goodwood and York’s Ebor meeting – have welcomed racegoers at pre-Covid levels, with the four days on the Knavesmire last week pulling in more than 83,000 spectators including 20,000 on Friday, a record for the third day.

Dozens of cross-party MPs have signed a letter to the defence secretary calling on him to evacuate all the guards who provided security for the British embassy in Kabul.
Despite a commitment from the Foreign Office on Friday that visas would be given to all the Afghan security staff contracted through the international security firm GardaWorld to protect the embassy, the guards have still been given no information about if and how they may be helped to leave the country.

A few years ago, I was in India on an England cricket tour, watching net practice. It was a baking hot day at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi, and for the observing media the only available shade was next to a small marquee – really, just a glorified tent – that had been erected for the batsmen to pad up and the bowlers to take a breather. It was while perching in this very spot that I became aware of the surreal conversation taking place on the other side of the canvas.
“Have you guys heard of Julian Assange?” one of the England players was asking his teammates. “It’s a mad story. I was up till about 4am reading about it. He’s the Wikileaks hacker who published all these secrets about the US government and all their wars and stuff. And so what the US government did, they basically framed him for rape and tried to get him extradited to Sweden. It’s mad.”

The emergency meeting of G7 nations on Tuesday – called by Boris Johnson as this year’s chair of the G7 – is in essence a gathering of the vanquished but faces a threefold agenda: how to ensure as many Afghans as possible can leave Kabul, and whether the US is prepared to stay beyond the original 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of all US forces; how a resettlement programme can be coordinated for the medium term; and finally, how to encourage the Taliban to form an inclusive government, including by threatening sanctions or withholding recognition.
But each country will bring its own concerns and an ugly postmortem on Joe Biden’s handling of the crisis cannot be ruled out.

                    <span>Readers respond to Alexei Navalny’s message from prison on steps that the west can take to tackle corrupt regimes
Alexei Navalny rightly asks: “If corruption is preventing us from finding solutions to the problems of the ‘big agenda’, has the time perhaps come to raise it to a priority on that agenda?” (Only action against corruption can solve the world’s biggest problems, 19 August).
In respect of the UK, this seems unlikely to happen because corruption – “the exploitation of an official position for personal gain” – is rife in the UK government also, albeit in a slightly less serious form than in certain other countries. For what is the funnelling of government contracts to manifestly incompetent companies run by cronies, or by political donors, if it is not corruption? What is the exercise of ministerial prerogative to benefit some individual, who shortly thereafter makes a donation to party funds, if not corruption?

                    <span>With children’s care in crisis, it is not enough to just paper over the cracks, writes Sue Hardman, while Prof Mike Stein recommends the implementation of progressive income tax and wealth reform to properly fund public services
Your editorial on children’s care in crisis (19 August) states that there has been a huge increase in referrals to social services, and notifications relating to domestic abuse. The article states that there is “no scenario in which increased spending can be avoided” on children’s care.
My fear is that any increase in resources will at best paper over the cracks, and be allocated to the sharp end of child protection out of sheer necessity. But if we truly want to make a difference to our children, then we need much, much more support for early intervention, particularly with regard to those children who have witnessed domestic abuse. NSPCC research reports that one in five children may witness domestic abuse. Any child who sees such abuse is at risk of suffering from poor mental health, not only in their younger years, but well into adulthood too.

Growth is slowing and price pressures are mounting. Consumers are anxious and an important commodity is in short supply. That was the state of the UK in the mid-1970s, when a single word was used to describe a combination of recession and a rising cost of living: stagflation.
And, in a much milder form, it is the malaise that is afflicting the economy today. The shortage is of computer chips rather than crude oil but the latest snapshot from IHS Markit/Cips suggests businesses again face supply and demand constraints.

Mogwai, Nadine Shah, Fontaines DC and more mesmerise in the festival’s overwhelming, glorious comeback
‘This is friggin’ overwhelming,” exclaims Nadine Shah, grasping for words to sum up the hyper-emotional, multi-sensory overload that was returning to a music festival. Everyone present for the Tyne and Wear singer’s revitalising set of blown-out rock’n’soul early evening Friday will have known exactly what she meant.
Arms jabbed, throats and noses swabbed, antiseptic liquids flowing along with the real ale and the tears: Green Man was back. As with most festivals, last year’s Covid-related cancellation imperilled this carnival of pastoral-psychedelic delight beneath the Welsh mountains. But its late summer berth allowed organisers to gamble on restrictions lifting in time for a full return in 2021. Fans kept the faith – most tickets were rollovers from 2020 – and were repaid with a programme that, despite few international artists, still somehow felt as solid as ever: a magical mixture of cosmic rock, alt-folk, ecstatic jazz and sanitised hands-in-the-air club music.

                    <span>‘I wrote it on a $50 piano with eight or 10 keys missing, but I could hear in my head the notes that weren’t there’
All fairytales that are read to little girls feature a Prince Charming who comes and saves them. But Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland did not. Alice was on her own, and she was in a very strange place, but she kept on going and she followed her curiosity – that’s the White Rabbit. A lot of women could have taken a message from that story about how you can push your own agenda.

                    <span>The former PM has some nerve to say the west should stay on in Afghanistan to protect the ‘gains’ of his 2001 invasion
Imbecilic, tragic, dangerous and unnecessary are the words used by Tony Blair to describe the US withdrawal from Afghanistan – and Britain’s as well. The former British prime minister believes the west should stay to protect the “gains” achieved by his original invasion in 2001, and by implication by the deaths of 457 British soldiers. As it is, Britain has been “relegated from the top division” of world powers, its enemies are “cheering” and its word is no longer relied on.
The final duty any prime minister owes his successors is silence. Otherwise he invites the obvious retort: but it was your fault.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Finance ministers, central bank governors and political leaders are hard at work preparing for the 2021 G20 heads of state and government summit in Rome on 30-31 October. With the Covid-19 pandemic stretching well into its second year, the meeting will come at a time of heightened uncertainty about public health and the global economy. And though the mechanisms of international cooperation have been weakened by the pandemic and remain bruised by Donald Trump’s legacy, they are more important than ever.
“Cooperation” need not refer to international coordination of national monetary or fiscal policies. For the most part, countries on their own can move those levers in whatever direction is best for them. Instead, the G20 should focus on financial stability, trade and vaccination. This is in addition to other important areas, especially the existential issue of global climate change, which should and will receive a lot of attention.

Considering it is known as London’s “worst attraction”, the Marble Arch Mound was strikingly busy when the Guardian paid a visit. But, then again, it is now free – and many people were only there to see if it was as bad as was being made out.
“Underwhelmed is probably a fair description of what we think,” said lawyer John Strange, visiting with his wife, Christine. “The views are not great, although you can pick out a few landmarks. There’s a lovely view of Battersea Power Station.”

                    <span>From Boris Johnson’s pledges that don’t add up to Sajid Javid’s visit to a ‘new’ hospital, NHS staff are being taken for fools
In my first year as a doctor, I witnessed the fetid reality of crumbling NHS real estate. Arriving at work one morning on the emergency assessment unit – the frenetic hub through which most of the hospital’s acutely unwell patients passed – I discovered it had ground to a malodorous halt. Men in hard hats were shouting orders to nurses, porters were evacuating patients on trolleys. I was told a main waste pipe on the floor above had ruptured, with predictably rancid and unhygienic consequences. So much for being an NHS teaching hospital of global renown: we were literally awash with slurry.
I was reminded of these unsavoury events by Sajid Javid, who tweeted last week: “Looking forward to opening one of new 48 hospitals [sic] later today.” Imagine bragging about building all those new hospitals when the existing ones are so rundown and dilapidated, they can’t even contain their human excrement.

Squirrelling away little parcels of ’nduja, the intensely spicy and garlicky spreadable sausage from Calabria, in the fridge or freezer is the type of modern-day household management that I feel Mrs Beeton would appreciate; it’s the culinary equivalent of having some frankincense and myrrh in your back pocket. Its rich, rounded flavour comes from a chilli particular to Calabria, and its flavour melts and seeps into other ingredients, lending them some of its gutsy, sassy attitude. It is beautifully feisty in this seasonal tagliatelle.

                    <span>Tom Cruise doesn’t just have a single chicken tikka masala when he goes to Birmingham – he has another one straight after. Has any man ever been more on-brand?
When Tom Cruise commits to something, he commits. When a Mission: Impossible stunt called for him to climb up the outside of the world’s tallest building, he actually climbed up the outside of the world’s tallest building. When Collateral required him to become an invisible assassin, he temporarily became a Fed-Ex driver to teach himself anonymity. When he fell in love with Katie Holmes, he did it with such couch-leaping intensity that it derailed his career for half a decade.
So when Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, he really went to Birmingham to have a curry. When Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, he did it with the same vigour that he uses to ride motorbikes or jump out of planes or scream at crew-members for not following Covid compliance protocols. Which is to say that when Tom Cruise went to Birmingham to have a curry, Tom Cruise went to Birmingham and had two curries, one after the other.

Thousands of activities providing life-saving support are being cut due to the government’s decision to reduce aid spending to 0.5% of gross national income.

Horrifying scenes are unfolding in Afghanistan. Taliban forces are reportedly going door to door, making blacklists of anyone who has worked with the former government. Even if Britain had not played a part in what’s unravelling right now, we would have a moral duty to act.
In this context, announcements from some UK regional leaders that they will accept Afghan refugees are welcome. But a years-long wait for resettlement cannot be the only protection we offer. The events unfolding in Afghanistan, with people forced to flee without a moment’s notice, show what it means to become a refugee and call into question an already rotten asylum system, which is due to go from bad to worse if the government’s new borders bill is passed.

                    <span>Campaigners say Britons are facing problems with Home Office over rights to return to UK
Ministers have been accused of breaching their promise to secure the post-Brexit rights of thousands of British nationals who settled in the EU and married foreigners. 
Campaigners at British in Europe (BiE) have written to the Foreign Office minister Wendy Morton and the immigration minister Kevin Foster telling of the “heartbreak” and “distress” endured by British citizens who are facing problems with the Home Office over their rights to return home to the UK.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Britain’s economic recovery from lockdown has slowed sharply in the past month despite the removal of most remaining pandemic restrictions, as businesses suffered the worst shortages of workers and materials in decades.
The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed that growth in private sector output slowed to a six-month low in August.

                    <span>Climate-conscious individual choices are good – but not nearly enough to save the planet. More than personal virtue, we need collective action
Personal virtue is an eternally seductive goal in progressive movements, and the climate movement is no exception. People pop up all the time to boast of their domestic arrangements or chastise others for what they eat or how they get around. The very short counterargument is that individual acts of thrift and abstinence won’t get us the huge distance we need to go in this decade. We need to exit the age of fossil fuels, reinvent our energy landscape, rethink how we do almost everything. We need collective action at every scale from local to global – and the good people already at work on all those levels need help in getting a city to commit to clean power or a state to stop fracking or a nation to end fossil-fuel subsidies. The revolution won’t happen by people staying home and being good.
But the oil companies would like you to think that’s how it works. It turns out that the concept of the “carbon footprint”, that popular measure of personal impact, was the brainchild of an advertising firm working for BP. As Mark Kaufman wrote this summer:

Haley Carter, a decorated US marines veteran and former assistant coach of the Afghanistan women’s national football team, has expressed her disappointment at senior military and political leaders for their handling of the evacuation from Afghanistan.
Carter, who served two tours in Iraq, said: “I would really like to see some senior military and political leadership step up. I’m incredibly disappointed with the information that’s coming out of the Pentagon because it’s just not good enough. On behalf of my players and on behalf of military personnel there working their butts off to pull this off I’m also incredibly frustrated and I don’t know how much longer what’s happening is maintainable.

                    <span>Pretend you’ve got one foot in the Med with this cheerful medley of seafood in a chilli-and-tomato sauce that’s just made for tossing through pasta
Somewhere – probably in one of the shoe boxes in a larger box, Russian doll-style, under the bed – is a strip from a magazine. It is a cartoon of a man sitting at a table eating, while under the table his feet are in two trays, one containing water, the other sand. Over the table is a striped umbrella, across from another man. Both are delightedly drinking well-decorated cocktails and wearing sun hats and sunglasses, while on the other side of the room is a cat, looking unimpressed, presumably because his litter tray is being used for another purpose, or maybe because he is simply unimpressed.
When I ripped the strip, I had a particular friend in mind. One who refuses to be defeated by anything, especially regarding food. When it rained on the day of a barbecue, she was up on the roof suspending a makeshift awning. If rain turned into a storm, she would drag the grill into the largest available space and hand out cardboard for fume wafting. Her usual response to bad news or bad days is to invite people over for a meal, often with a theme, and she generally invents a new drink – the parma violet is particularly memorable, although later painful. If you are having a bad day, she will run you a hot bath, make you chicken and barley soup, and either talk, not talk, or keep you company while watching five hours of TV.

                    <span>Ashleigh, 33 and Matt, 32, met at a fancy dress party in Vancouver. They live in London with their son and three-legged cat
Matt had been living in Vancouver for a year when he was invited to a student fancy dress party in the spring of 2014. “I’d moved to study for a master’s degree in entomology,” he says. “Coming from Ohio, it was the biggest city I’d ever lived in. I’d never even ridden a city bus before.” The event had a lumberjack theme, popular at Canadian house parties at the time. “Everyone had to dress up in plaid and overalls, and there was a giant wooden Jenga game. You had to wear a hard hat to play,” he says. When he spotted Ashleigh across the room, he couldn’t resist going to say hello. “I thought she looked just like Kate Bush. I’d recently discovered her music, so I went to speak to her.”
Ashleigh had moved to Vancouver from Toronto to be with her boyfriend, but it wasn’t working out. “I had a job in a museum, but was living in a cockroach-filled apartment and had no friends. I wanted to meet new people,” she says, and an acquaintance invited her to the party. When Matt approached, she was busy trying to negotiate the party playlist with another guest. “I used to have a student radio show and was really into music,” she says. They talked for a while before Matt got the courage to tell her she looked like Kate Bush. “People have actually said that about me before,” she says.

                    <span>From the right way to exercise, to what to eat and drink and the case for HRT, experts explain how women can prepare for midlife changes to their bodies
Sometimes your body notices things before your mind does: you might think you’re so far away from the menopause that a hot flush is just a thing you can fake to get out of a boring situation, but your midriff knows better. Lucinda Meade, 57, is a physiotherapist and personal trainer. She has trained many clients through the menopause and says it tends to start with surreptitious weight gain around the middle, which they then can’t shift. It may be accompanied by aches and pains in smaller joints, and an unappetising smörgåsbord of “mood changes, sleep changes, annoying visits to the GP to be given antidepressants”.
All this makes perfect sense from a hormonal perspective, as another trainer, Sarah Overall, 51, describes: “Oestrogen governs so many of your bodily processes, and one of the things it’s involved in is water regulation. It’s a lot easier for tendons and ligaments and joints to become dehydrated. And that can also lead to a resurgence of old injuries.” Plus, “when your female hormones decrease, you go from having a gynoid shape, carrying fat on your hips and thighs, to android obesity, abdominal fat, which is a male shape.”

Mark Sanford is not the first Republican to turn against former US president Donald Trump and pay a political price. But he is unique in publishing a memoir that links his decision to lessons learned from an extramarital affair and his attempt to cover it up.
Sanford was the governor of South Carolina when, in 2009, he flew to Argentina to be with a woman who was not his wife but told his staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. The falsehood was rapidly exposed, made lurid headlines and ended his 20-year marriage.

Annie Murphy moves straight from Schitt’s Creek to another swearily titled series, this time a bold meta-TV experiment. Part classic canned-laughter sitcom, part dark crime drama, Murphy stars as Allison, a sitcom character who constantly has to stomach her doofus husband’s sexist jokes. But the moment she’s away from him, the show morphs into a different beast, and she plots to bump Kevin off by any means necessary.

My favourite part of childhood summer holidays with my dad was our trip to the Yorkshire Dales agricultural show, a respite from his usual gruelling regime of mountain walks and examining dead fauna. Between prize rams and displays of trimmed leeks we watched the fell-running races: infants and gnarled pensioners scampering up and then down a sheer crag, all for a biscuit and a certificate.
“Look at the little bastards!” Dad would exclaim, gesturing incredulously, plastic pint glass slopping bitter as wiry five-year-olds whizzed past, legs a blur. Lumpen by his side, mouth crammed with cake, I would feel an obscure longing: why wasn’t I a fearless, muddy-kneed dynamo?

                    <span>The MP was cleared last month of housing fraud. Finally able to speak about her ordeal, she opens up about her controlling ex-husband, the family that disowned her and her political future
When Apsana Begum found out she had been acquitted of housing fraud by a jury at Snaresbrook crown court, she fell to her knees and wept.
“It was such an emotional moment,” says the 31-year-old Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse. “For at least 18 months, I have just tried to hold it all together.” We are meeting at a cafe in her constituency, chosen for its tucked-away location – if Begum is spotted on one of the busier streets, she will be accosted constantly by well-wishers. “It’s where I grew up,” she explains.

                    <span>The Brazilian butt lift has become the world’s fastest growing cosmetic surgery, despite mounting concerns over the number of deaths from the procedure. What is driving its popularity?
This week we are revisiting some of our favourite episodes from the year so far. This episode was first broadcast on 2 March.
Rachel Humphreys talks to Guardian writer Sophie Elmhirst about the increasing popularity of the Brazilian butt lift (BBL), which is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery in the world. Since 2015, the number of butt lifts performed globally has grown by 77.6%, according to a recent survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The BBL began in Brazil, birthplace of aesthetic surgery and the myth of the naturally “sticky-outy” bottom, the kind seen in countless tourist board images of bikini-clad women on Copacabana beach. As part of her research, Sophie spent time with the British aesthetic surgeon Dr Lucy Glancey and her patient Melissa*, who was planning to have her second BBL. Sophie tells Rachel why she thinks more and more women are demanding the procedure despite the risks – the BBL has been called the world’s most dangerous procedure.

More than 80 private Covid-19 testing companies could lose government approval to sell PCR travel tests following a review by ministers into misleading costs from “cowboy” providers.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said on Monday that 82 providers have been issued a two-strike warning for displaying lower prices on the gov.uk site than are available at the point of checkout, making up about 18 per cent of the companies on the government’s approved list.

Marseille players did not return for the restart of their Ligue 1 match with Nice after ugly clashes with home fans, forcing the referee to abandon the game.
The game was originally suspended in the 75th minute when Marseille players and Nice fans had to be separated after bottles were thrown between the two during their league match. An on-pitch melee ensued and the game had to be delayed by the match officials.

Rangers have launched an investigation after the video, from a supporters’ bus, emerged on Sunday afternoon, when Steven Gerrard’s side were in Dingwall for a 4-2 win over Ross County. Fans were seen singing racist songs and making offensive eye gestures to mobile phones.

Boris Johnson will personally lobby Joe Biden at the G7 leaders summit, No 10 said on Sunday night, pleading with him to keep US troops at Kabul airport beyond the end of August, after a weekend of tension between the UK and its closest ally.
With the Taliban tightening their grip at the airport, Downing Street confirmed the PM would lobby the US president on Tuesday at the virtual meeting. The news came as Taliban forces sought to assert their authority, blaming the US for the “anarchy” at the airport and insisting they were the only ones capable of restoring order. Throughout the day, Taliban fighters fired their guns into the air and used batons to force people into orderly queues in an attempt to halt the desperate scenes in which at least 20 people have died.

When Ruby Wax Met … (BBC Two) gives us a double whammy of Wax, then and now, and proves to be an absorbing analysis of celebrity, fame and the massive cultural shifts that have taken place over the past four decades. In the 90s and early 00s, Wax pioneered documentary-style celebrity interviews, with the camera often rolling before she and her subject had even met. She spent time with A-list stars such as Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn and OJ Simpson (more on him later) and was granted a level of access that is unheard of in this age of brand management and “controlling the narrative”.
Now a writer, comedian and mental health campaigner, Wax says she has not seen these interviews for 25 years: “It’s another life. It doesn’t even feel like the same skin.”

That defeat intensified the already considerable pressure on a defiant Mikel Arteta, whose side – admittedly weakened by Covid – have not only lost their first two games of the season but are still to score a goal.

Carnoustie’s 18th has caused such championship carnage that one wonders about the utterly warped mindset of the person who designed it. “Home” is an understated name for a hole that should come with an X rating.
Nanna Koerstz Madsen is the latest golfer to come a cropper right in front of the Carnoustie Hotel. Amazingly, this capitulation did not even include a trip to the infamous Barry Burn. She was in with a live chance of becoming the first Dane to win a male or female major when taking to the 72nd hole in a 12-under-par tie with Anna Nordqvist.

The seventh season of ITV2’s reality TV staple has not appeared sanitised as many predicted, after producers introduced duty of care protocols after the death of previous islanders Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, and host Caroline Flack, who all died by suicide within a period of 20 months.

Brighton and Hove council, which has been under Green party control since last year, has banned toxic weedkillers that include chemicals such as glyphosate after a petition from residents.

With many parts of Australia still in lockdown, connecting with others can feel increasingly challenging.
Whether video calls are stifling your usual banter with friends, or the problem is actually hearing them at all over a patchy internet connection, Zoom fatigue is real.

States are continuing to push back against the terms of a nationally agreed plan to open up the country once vaccination rates hit 70% and 80%, warning the worsening Covid crisis in NSW could yet be a dealbreaker.
As a pared-down federal parliament prepares to sit in Canberra on Monday amid the ACT’s lockdown, the prime minister Scott Morrison is insisting that growing case numbers are not a reason to abandon the national plan agreed to by all states and territories.

                    <span>The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. It is now set for its highest number of gun killings in 20 years
As Covid cases surge once more in the US, another public health crisis is pummelling the country too. Last year, gun killings soared by around 4,000, to almost 20,000 in total – the worst single-year increase on record. So far, 2021 looks even worse. In the first five months alone, more than 8,100 people died. America is set for the deadliest toll in nearly two decades.
Alarmingly, there is also a surge in gun purchases. The US already had more guns than people when sales began rising a few years ago. But last year saw a 64% jump compared with the previous year, to an estimated 20m guns. Around a fifth of buyers were first-time owners. The pandemic sparked a rush to purchase firearms, and some bought because so many others were doing so. The backlash against Black Lives Matter protests may have played a part. Black Americans saw the highest increase in gun ownership and, reportedly, Asian Americans also bought more guns, as hate crimes have risen. Sales have continued to grow this year, with manufacturers struggling to produce enough ammunition.

                    <span>An acute shortage of staff offers an incentive to improve a stressful working culture
White Heat, by Marco Pierre White, is one of the most influential recipe books of the past 30 years. Published in 1990, its edgy black and white photography popularised an idea of the chef-as-hero, immersed in the creative Sturm und Drang of a frantically busy restaurant kitchen. Its cover features a handsome 28-year-old Mr White in a butcher’s apron, looking moody and a little like Jim Morrison.
For most chefs the reality has always been much less romantic. Long, unsociable hours are often poorly rewarded, and a sometimes brutal workload makes cheffing one of the most stressful ways to earn a living. Burnout is commonplace, and a healthy work-life balance difficult to maintain. One 2019 survey found that eight out of 10 employees in professional kitchens had experienced mental health problems during their career. Research by the Unite union discovered that 52% of chefs have a negative view of their jobs and only 22% would recommend the life to school-leavers. Happily, there are some tentative early signs that the hospitality hiatus caused by Covid may lead to change for the better.

Following up earlier concerns about medical gloves for the NHS being produced in Malaysia, where there have been consistent reports of forced labour in factories, Emily Thornberry called for an urgent response.

The children’s author and illustrator Jill Murphy, who has died of cancer aged 72, was loved across generations for picture books that capture the essence of childhood in a realistic yet magical way.
Her career began at the age of 24 when her first book, The Worst Witch (1974), was published. An immediate success, it has consistently been on every list of top recommendations for seven-year-olds ever since. Equally successful have been her picture books about the everyday life of both the Bear family in Peace at Last in 1980 and the Large family in Five Minutes’ Peace in 1986. They and their sequels have been go-to books for children and parents alike with their humorous interpretations of the trials of parenthood.

                    <span>Glasgow-based choreographer Mele Broomes’ intelligence stands out amid the cascade of online dance and circus offerings from this year’s festival
Watching recorded dance on your laptop at home couldn’t be further from the Edinburgh fringe experience: the buzz on the streets, the overload of shows, the odd venues and out-there experiences. But there’s still plenty that’s out there on the digital side. You can get your fix of, say, naked experimental circus, in Race Horse Company’s O’DD for example. It’s not wholly naked, I should say: later in the solo, Rauli Dahlberg’s body wrapped in clingfilm, flipping on a trampoline is rather mesmerising. 
There are more trampolines in a meditative quartet Ground Unplugged; four dancers on trampettes locked in a synchronised bounce. Or there’s Touchdown, a half-dance, half-physics lecture from Taiwan, in which Cheng Hao combines discussing the reckless and unpredictable nature of electrons with insomniac musings on the meaning of life, while seemingly peeling himself from the ceiling.

Opting for hydrogen that is made using fossil fuels rather than renewable electricity could create up to 8m tonnes of carbon emissions every year by 2050, according to an analysis of government data.
The figures show that the use of fossil-fuel hydrogen, or “blue hydrogen”, would create the same carbon emissions each year that more than a million petrol cars would produce, compared with using zero-carbon “green hydrogen”.

‘He is one of the best players in the world,’ says Spurs coach

Nuno Espírito Santo praised Harry Kane for helping Tottenham Hotspur to victory at Wolves in the striker’s first appearance of the season. With Kane’s future remaining uncertain as Manchester City contemplate whether to make another attempt to prise him from north London, the player came on as a 71st-minute substitute at Molineux, where Spurs won 1-0 thanks to an early penalty by Dele Alli.
Kane was applauded on to the pitch by the travelling fans, a gesture he reciprocated after the final whistle. “He did well, he helped the team,” said Nuno of the striker who could have marked his return with a goal but saw his shot saved by José Sá. “He is still in the process of improving his fitness. But he is one of the best players in the world. You can see he helped the team in possession.”

                    <span>The ex-Inbetweener’s new work-in-progress standup show, about breaking beyond being typecast, has a self-lacerating character
The maladroit comic parlaying their anxiety into humour is as old as standup itself. But it’s a highwire act: other people’s neuroses can be funny, or – one wrong step – troubling instead. Is it unfair to expect sure-footedness from Trying Not to Panic, the standup debut of ex-Inbetweener Joe Thomas? Perhaps – it’s a work-in-progress after all, like so many of the offerings on this year’s Edinburgh not-quite-the-fringe. Comedians have had few opportunities to hone their shows, or their craft, over the past 18 months. It’s not been the optimum period in which to launch a new set, much less a new standup career. (A difficulty with which fellow Inbetweener Simon Bird has also wrestled.)
So: the good news is that this is a striking debut from Thomas, here to lament his career stasis and how the Channel 4 sitcom for ever defines him in the public perception. And the less good news? Well, I’m not sure the show’s humour is sufficiently buoyant – yet – to lift audiences above Thomas’s pit of despair. Some of the gags are awfully cynical, and the self-lacerating character of the comedy left me uncertain whether to laugh with Thomas, or worry for him.

                    <span>Theatr Clywd, Mold
Letting the audience choose props and costumes adds both absurd and affecting possibilities to this selection of 15 new short plays
Directed by Theatr Clwyd’s artistic director, Tamara Harvey, Curtain Up is an appropriately celebratory title for the company’s three-week season of 15 new short plays by writers from Wales, performed by a cast of 30. For each of the three weeks, five plays are performed by 10 actors at each performance.
With each play at little over 10 minutes in length, it allows for swift and playful variations in dramatic tone and formal experimentation. In the first week’s plays, Samantha O’Rourke’s Finding Feet was a movingly heartfelt monologue of love at first sight, while in The Ongoing Eternal Search for “Da” by Mari Izzard, sexual tensions were inflamed to Nintendo sound effects.
The central conceit common in all of these dramatic vignettes is that each contains an unspecified significant object. These props are chosen by the audience at the beginning of each performance, as well as a costume, unknown to the performers. We are also invited to intervene in the casting of roles. The performance begins, and the five plays unfurl according to the audience’s interventions, in this case performed by the first week’s uniformly great cast.

                    <span>Readers despair at the Tory government’s treatment of the people who risked their lives to work for it in Afghanistan
You have to admire the genius of the UK’s refugee policy: first, no one who gets here unofficially can be considered for asylum and the only way to get here is by official routes – but there are no official routes in (UK to take 20,000 Afghan refugees over five years under resettlement plan, 17 August). And second, with the Afghan crisis, we are told by Whitehall that “we don’t want to do this on the basis of whoever can get themselves to Kabul airport over the course of the next week … that means most people will be coming via third countries”. And there is the genius of the approach: anyone coming via third countries will be told that they should claim asylum in the first one they come to, absolving the need for the UK to take any at all. Catch-22 made real.
And we have to endure boasts about the UK’s long record of welcoming refugees – one MP was heard bleating on BBC Radio 4 last week that Britain leads the world in taking people in. Lord Dubs was quoted in the same report as saying that if Canada can take in 20,000 refugees now, why can’t the UK do better than 20,000 over five years?

                    <span>Sue Miller and Sean Tompkins on the importance of retrofitting and reuse of materials in construction in order to reduce the UK’s carbon emissions
Your article on the importance of retrofit and reuse of buildings over new-build is most timely (Editorial, 18 August). As the planning bill makes its way through parliament this autumn, it could be amended to reflect the shocking disparity in carbon emissions that you highlight. Indeed, as the bill is likely to be debated while the UK hosts Cop26, it would seem perverse of the government not to take the opportunity to bring the planning system and construction industry into line with the Cop26 objectives. 
Sue Miller 
Liberal Democrat, House of Lords
• Changes to VAT rates on the refurbishment and repair of buildings are long overdue. There are nearly 30m buildings in the UK, and approximately 28m of these will need to be retrofitted by the end of 2050 to meet our net zero commitments. Given that the energy used to run our homes accounts for over a quarter of all CO2 emissions, there is an urgent need to do more.

Afghanistan is facing a potentially catastrophic perfect storm of bank closures and shortages of hard currency on top of the suspension of money transfers by companies that sustain the key flow of remittances to Afghans from abroad by family members.
With ATMs in cities emptied, and banks and the main Sarai Shahzada financial exchange in Kabul still closed, the country has faced a series of economic shocks since the Taliban seized power a week ago.

Stefan Löfven said on Sunday that he will step down as Swedish prime minister and head of the Social Democratic party in November, after seven years in power.
The unexpected announcement – made during his annual summer speech – came before next year’s general election and after Löfven in June became the first Swedish leader ever to lose a motion in parliament.

                    <span>If anything encapsulated a trying afternoon for Manchester United, it was the sight of Paul Pogba being booked for a crude challenge as the clock ticked into second-half stoppage time, seconds after the Southampton striker Che Adams made a superb sliding tackle on Bruno Fernandes. United wiped the floor with Leeds last weekend but had to settle for a point here as Mason Greenwood equalised to extend their unbeaten away league run to 27 games, matching Arsenal’s top-flight record.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side were erratic and off-colour, teasing only patches of class for the noisy travelling fans. Southampton proved fiendish opponents, successfully shackling United’s glittering cast and could have earned victory on another day. For Solskjær, the warning signs were there long before Adams’ shot beat David de Gea, via a wicked deflection off Fred, with half an hour gone. “We lost our heads when they scored,” Solskjær said.

The couple, aged 42 and 38, allegedly ran an association that performed ceremonies involving psychotropic substances for as much as €150 (£129) a session. Weekend retreats were also on offer at a cost of up to €350 (£300).

Northern leaders have reacted with dismay to further claims that HS2’s eastern leg to Leeds may be scrapped, while some “red wall” Tory MPs celebrated the mooted demise of a “hugely expensive white elephant”.
All summer, leaks from Whitehall have suggested the government is likely to ditch plans to extend the high-speed rail to Leeds. The latest, in the Sunday Mirror, quoted an anonymous source as saying that halting the eastern leg wouldsave £40bn and “there’s no way we’re going to see this built in our lifetimes”.

                    <span>From Neil Young to Keith Richards, a generation of musicians revered Phil and Don’s haunting music
• US music star Don Everly dies aged 84
Among the hundreds of hours of outtakes from the recording sessions that eventually became the Beatles’ Let It Be album, there is a version of Two of Us, taped on 25 January 1969. As John Lennon and Paul McCartney harmonise, the latter says to the former: “Take it, Phil”, a reference to Phil and Don Everly, the duo upon whom the pair had originally attempted to model themselves. On an early holiday, Lennon and McCartney attempted to impress local girls by telling them they had a band back home and they were “the British Everly Brothers”.
Shortly afterwards, the pair temporarily stopped working on the song entirely and began performing a ragged cover of Bye Bye Love instead. It’s both oddly sweet – a fleeting moment where the ill-tempered sessions actually achieved their aim of returning the Beatles to their roots – and oddly telling. At the end of a decade in which they had done more than anyone to alter rock music entirely, shifting its parameters until it was occasionally unrecognisable from the state in which it had started the 60s – and rendering the likes of Don and Phil Everly old news in the process – John Lennon and Paul McCartney still wanted to sound like the Everly Brothers. Throughout it all, McCartney later wrote, “their music echoed through my mind”.

                    <span>Any evaluation of the campaign must prioritise genuine investigation over reputation management
It was an extraordinary volte-face. On 7 August Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff and professional head of Britain’s military, wrote an op-ed on Afghanistan in the Times stating that it was too soon “to write off the country”. “There are increasing signs that the population is rallying in defiance,” he added. Eleven days later, after the Taliban had taken Afghanistan’s provincial capitals, followed by Kabul, and the Afghan army – raised by the west at a cost of $83bn – had melted away, Carter appeared on television. “You have to be very careful using the word enemy,” he told Sky News. “People need to understand who the Taliban actually are … They are bound together by a common purpose which is they don’t like corrupt governance … I do think that they have changed.” 
The general deserves some compassion. Like the rest of the leadership of Britain’s army, the post-9/11 wars defined his professional life. Carter commanded a brigade in Iraq in 2003-04 and later led a “regional command” in Afghanistan. His recent public pronouncements suggest an understandable desire not to undercut the sacrifices of his troops. Nonetheless, Carter’s dramatic pivot, combined – more bluntly – with the fact that he is still in post, underlines an important point. There is an urgent need within the British military now for a root and branch appraisal of why this has all happened. Yet, due to a variety of factors, both inside and outside the military, a full postmortem is unlikely.

                    <span>‘Freedom day’ was supposed to bring business as usual but Nando’s is out of chicken and carmakers are low on chips
First there were empty supermarket shelves and “pingdemic” staff shortages; now Nando’s is out of chicken and the car industry short of chips. It’s an unusual state of affairs for a country where normality was supposed to resume a month ago.
After the lifting of most pandemic restrictions on the government’s 19 July “freedom day”, the long hard slog of Covid-19 was meant to be all over bar the shouting. Britain’s economic potential would be unleashed, allowing for the fastest growth since the second world war.

Nicole Ari Parker has been billed to replace Kim Cattrall in the Sex and the City reboot, after the backlash that accompanied the news that the era-defining show’s most iconic character was done with the series.
Ari Parker, known for starring in the acclaimed series Empire as well as Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights, will reportedly replace Cattrall as the fourth member of the New York friend group. According to the Mail on Sunday, Ari Parker, 50, will play Carrie Bradshaw’s new best friend, documentary-maker Lisa Todd Wexley.

                    <span>First I got sunburn, then one of the worst cases of chickenpox the doctor had ever seen. I was supposed to be on holiday, yet I was the tourist attraction
The hottest summer nights of my life were in Australia around the Christmas of 1988. My brother was on a gap year with a mate, working in a factory in Dandenong, a suburb of Melbourne. They were living in a tiny, scruffy caravan in an overgrown field when I went to visit. It had come with air-conditioning, they explained, but on their first night it shook violently for a few seconds upon being switched on, before dying.
The heat in this oven they called home was simply appalling. I slept not at all. But this was only the third-most terrible night of my life; the second-worst and the very worst were still a couple of weeks away.

When the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was published in early August, it confirmed what was already being made increasingly obvious by 2021’s extreme weather events: the burning of fossil fuels is “choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk”.
While the report’s main headlines weren’t news to many – especially climate scientists, who have been sounding the alarm for decades, and the fossil fuel industry, which has spent billions obscuring the truth about climate change – one cohort in the UK was mostly able to continue with their days unaware of its implications: young children.

Coronavirus – latest updates

A Covid-19 testing company co-owned by a former Labour justice minister and a Labour councillor has been accused of failing to deliver kits and test results and not refunding customers, forcing them to fall back on the NHS.
RT Diagnostics is one of hundreds of firms that won government approval to sell PCR tests to travellers planning to enter England, after ministers decided to leave provision to the private sector, under a system that has drawn criticism over allegations of poor service against several companies.

Ali Jawad posted a picture of himself on a table top this weekend. Mask on, power shake to hand, Jawad’s arms were raised in celebration. The British powerlifter, who was born without legs and also deals with the debilitating effects of Crohn’s disease, had made it to the athletes’ village in Tokyo. “Arrived in the Paralympic village!! Absolutely amazing view from our rooms,” he wrote, adding a drooling emoji to reinforce the point.

The first time the Taliban took Kabul, 25 years ago they tortured and killed former President Mohammad Najibullah, dragged his body behind a truck through the streets, then hung it from a lamp-post.
Last week, with Kabul surrounded and a second victory almost inevitable, the Taliban ordered their troops to hold back from entering the city, to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. When they did march in, it was to a soundtrack of their commanders offering an “amnesty” for anyone who had opposed them over the last two decades.

A former defence minister has said the UK failed to “stand up” to the US over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, amid more questions about Dominic Raab’s holiday-induced absence last weekend.
Raab, the foreign secretary, has faced repeated demands to resign for remaining until Monday on a family holiday in Crete while the Afghan government collapsed, and delegating tasks to junior ministers.

The obituary of Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) had already been written.
Yet as Germany’s election campaign is about to enter its home stretch, it is the centre-left party of Olaf Scholz that is enjoying a surge of energy as its rivals start to lag.

                    <span>Season four of the drama based on Margaret Atwood’s novel has seen Elisabeth Moss’s June in near-constant peril. However, it seems her latent rage could be the thing that sets her free
I find myself wondering why I am still so invested in The Handmaid’s Tale on a weekly basis, as the camera slowly closes in on Elisabeth Moss’s face, her character June pained and broken by cruelty after cruelty. The apocalyptic drama is coming to the end of its fourth run, and when this season began, it found itself boxed into an inevitable corner. How could it sustain the story far beyond Margaret Atwood’s novel, without keeping its characters in a cage, and becoming an unrewarding display of relentless misery?
It had begun to go around in circles. June would defy the rules, escape the authorities, get captured, undergo torture, and then begin the whole cycle again. It made it hard for viewers to feel satisfaction in her victories. What was the point in rooting for her, if she would inevitably end up back at the start?

Forty years ago a small group of women, along with a few men and children in buggies in tow, left their homes in Wales to protest against the arrival of US nuclear warheads at RAF Greenham Common. The steps they took that day would lead to the establishment of the Greenham women’s peace camp, which at its height gathered more than 70,000 women for direct action and became the biggest female-led protest since women’s suffrage.
Now hundreds more will march 130 miles to mark the 40th anniversary of the camp and call for the original women who led it to be remembered and respected as much as the suffragettes.

Channel 4’s successful decade-long mission to make the Paralympics a fixture on prime-time TV could be cast aside by a new owner if the government sells the state-owned broadcaster to the highest bidder, according to a former chairman and chief executive.
Channel 4 plans to broadcast a record 1,300 hours of coverage of the Tokyo Games, almost three times the amount the BBC managed with its Olympic coverage, cementing its place as the world’s leading Paralympic broadcaster.

This is the most extraordinary summer I can remember. The day on which monsoon-style rains smashed my tomato plants to rags was followed by one so hot and dry I could barely find the energy to toss a salad. This is the future I guess, when those of us who like to cook not only seasonally but also for the weather will be kept on their toes. (Last week we went from eating tomato salad in the garden to wanting pie and mashed potatoes by the fire in the space of 24 hours.) I am getting used to planning no further ahead than my next meal. A certain spontaneity is required if we are to cook in tune with this crazy, unpredictable weather.
There was a tray of sardines at the fishmonger’s the other day – silver, black and gold with eyes as bright as jewels. An all too rare sighting of a seasonal fish I first met as a kid, tucked up in golden tins of tomato sauce that you opened with a little metal key. Then we ate them on toast for tea.

                    <span>Foreign secretary agrees to visa waivers for group of 200 but British Council staff still in limbo 
More than 200 Afghan journalists who worked with the British media are to be granted access to the UK after an appeal by a coalition of British newspapers and broadcasters.
Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has agreed to issue visa waivers for the group after officials said the government recognised the risks they took in pursuit of media freedom and the defence of human rights through their work.

                    <span>He’s been shadow chancellor, and he wowed the crowds on Strictly. Now Ed Balls has written a book that’s part memoir, part cookbook. He talks about kitchen confidence, failing at diets – and why politics is still a hot subject for him
Ed Balls is unhappy about the mess. They say you can judge a cook by how he cleans and Britain’s one-time education minister, shadow chancellor of the exchequer and most popular Gangnam Style tribute act is surrounded by broken shells, tiramisu, pasta sauce, soup and – to his mind most offensively – runny custard in a hard pastry base. There are Le Creusets and frying pans and bowls and sieves, the detritus of any self-respecting cookery photoshoot.
“It’s very upsetting,” Balls, 54, protests, brandishing a creamy whisk. “I’m a clean-as-you-go chef. I don’t want people to get the wrong idea. This is more like Yvette’s kitchen,” he adds, throwing his wife, Yvette Cooper MP, under the slovenly bus. “She’s like a snail, you can see wherever she’s been. It’s one of the reasons she doesn’t cook. At a certain point I just decided it was easier for me to do it.”

                    <span>Embracing its strange past is a blessing for Trasmoz as thousands flock to its witchcraft attractions
Tucked into the foothills of northern Spain, the village of Trasmoz attracts thousands of tourists each year. For many, the allure is not its half-ruined castle nor stunning mountain backdrop but rather a curious quirk of history: Trasmoz is Spain’s only excommunicated and cursed village.
“So far, being excommunicated and cursed hasn’t been bad for us,” said Lola Ruiz Diaz, one of the 47 or so people who live all year round in Trasmoz, some 50 miles north-west of Zaragoza. “It’s turned out to be a point in our favour.”

                    <span>The foreign secretary was in good company in woefully misjudging the Taliban threat
Many of the excitable characters who impulsively phone talk radio stations without having thought through their contradictory positions are rightly horrified by footage of desperate people falling off planes into the chaotic inferno of hate of Biden and Johnson’s bodged British and American withdrawal from Afghanistan. Others, explaining that Brexit was about stopping refugees and immigration, want everyone there to be left to die, as sorting out the mess we have made is apparently not our business. Admittedly, I have the same attitude to the toilet bowl after an ill-advised lamb phaal, but I am just a 53-year-old “so-called” comedian, not an elected leader of the free world with blood on his hands.
On Wednesday, I drove distractedly across England listening to a baffling prime minister’s questions. Various politicians, trying to read the fickle electorate’s current position on the hate/compassion mood board, swinging again like it did after the death of little Alan Kurdi, explained how welcoming Britain has always been to refugees. I stopped to eat an artisanal steak pie at the Rollright Stones and wondered how our legendarily welcoming nature squared with the government’s new nationality and borders bill, which aims to criminalise anyone who attempts to seek asylum and anyone who attempts to help anyone seeking asylum. Even lifeboat men and women risking their lives to dredge dying children from the Channel could be criminals it seems, the horrible bastards. A fake Home Office website called Migrants on the Move, like the fake Conservative Campaign HQ factcheckUK site Dominic Raab defended during the last election, even purports to offer objective but deliberately discouraging advice to would-be Britons. Who even knew that the UK was full of venomous hamsters and that, in Kent, human hair is illegal?

Nordelta is Argentina’s most well-known gated community: an enclave of spacious homes for the rich amid a dreamy landscape of lakes and streams north of Buenos Aires.
But environmentalists question its very existence because it is built on the wetlands of the Paraná, the second most important river in South America after the Amazon.

                    <span>According to addiction expert Dr Anna Lembke, our smartphones are making us dopamine junkies, with each swipe, like and tweet feeding our habit. So how do we beat our digital dependency?
Dr Anna Lembke, a world-leading expert on addiction, is concerned about my “phone problem”. During our interview I confess, in passing, to having an unhealthy attachment to my iPhone, checking it every few minutes like a compulsive tic (sound familiar?) Lembke is having none of it. She wants me to abstain from using it for at least 24 hours by locking it in a drawer and going out. The first 12 hours will be filled with anxiety and Fomo, but as time unfolds, I’ll experience a sense of “real freedom”, will gain insight into my relationship with my digital companion and will “resolve to get back to using it a little differently”, she says, speaking with a soothing yet firm tone.
I’d do well to heed her advice. As the chief of Stanford University’s dual diagnosis addiction clinic (which caters to people with more than one disorder), Lembke has spent the past 25-plus years treating patients addicted to everything from heroin, gambling and sex to video games, Botox and ice baths. The bespectacled 53-year-old psychiatrist has written an influential book about the prescription-drug epidemic, delivered Ted Talks on America’s opioid crisis and appeared as a talking head in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma to discuss the drug that is social media. She’s a whiz on why we get hooked on things – and how we can enjoy pleasurable things in healthier doses.

Being in someone’s else’s house when they are not there (and you’re not a burglar) is a contemplative experience, like walking round a film set. It may be people that make a home, but an empty home, that once held people, still holds something. I’m in my mother’s house and she’s not here, because she’s away and even though I’ve been here a hundred times since I left home, this time it feels different. I fill the sink with cups that I only wash on a need-to-use basis, and I eat chicken fillets and berries, like a forager with access to a deli counter. I live like this for days. I visit the dentist and then my old friend, Andrea, picks me up and feeds me pizza and the most glorious five-ingredient (chocolate, eggs, sugar, butter and flour) Claudia Roden torta di cioccolato from Roden’s The Food of Italy, which I urge you to buy and try.

Depending on where you look on social media, making money seems to be straightforward. Learning how to buy a property in the UK with no money, or getting the basics of being a day trader in 30 minutes, are both lessons on YouTube, along with a plethora of advice on how to earn from cryptocurrency. Meanwhile “finfluencers”, with varying degrees of knowledge, have blossomed on Instagram and TikTok.
But the standard of advice varies widely from grounded, sage information on how to invest, to unregulated personalities offering shallow quick takes without fully setting out the pitfalls of what might happen to your money.

Last July, Filippo Mancini, a fourth-generation ice-cream maker, ran the Belly Banger competition from his shop on the esplanade at Prestwick beach in Ayrshire.
Punters paid £7.50 for 12 scoops – “whatever flavours you wanted, a wee biscuit in the top and some cream”. They had 15 minutes to eat them. If they managed it they got a certificate and their money back. Mancini, who says about a dozen people succeeded, plans to run the competition again this September.

                    <span>Having suffered a 90% drop in population, they still face extinction in Britain – but a new initiative offers a glimmer of hope
A hundred and fifty water voles were last week settling into new homes on the riverbanks of Hertfordshire. The animals had been released from pens the previous week as part of a campaign to halt the devastating drop in Arvicola amphibius number across the British Isles over the past 50 years.
Once widespread in the UK, water voles – whose most known incarnation is Ratty in Wind in the Willows – have suffered a 90% drop in population since the 1970s. Feral mink, which kill young voles in their nests, in combination with major changes in land use, have resulted in the widespread eradication of a species that was once a ubiquitous presence along the banks of Britain’s rivers.

My friend is trying to buy a flat in Bristol, and each time he sends me a link with a little question mark, I get a complicated rush. Looking at property websites has been an anti-pleasure of mine for many years now, and sometimes I browse as meditation, other times masochism, often as a sorbet-like palate cleanser before paddling into a crisis.
But this week the flat he was viewing had an oddness to it and it took a minute for me to work out what was wrong. I realised, with unsurprised shock, that the furniture was not of human size. The rooms had been staged – with a chest of drawers the width of a shelf, a single bed had been made up with two pillows to appear as a double, and so on – with a certain poetry. The decoration was to nobody’s taste, which I respect – pastel velvet cushions, many small and sharp-angled mirrors, a wide-backed chair masquerading as a sofa, a cheese plant instead of a wardrobe. The flat was furnished for an unhappy couple seen from a distance and still he was outbid, which is good because it means I can carry on looking.

                    <span>Many of us have been confounded by recent figures, but the British model remains flawed
British capitalism seems to be on a roll. A million job vacancies were advertised in July, a new monthly record. Early signs are that unwinding the furlough scheme, now under way, is not going to cause a sharp rise in unemployment.
House prices are rising at the fastest rate since 2004. Public borrowing in July halved compared with last July. Many new companies are being created. Business confidence is rising. The recovery is moving so fast as threats of lockdown recede that the UK on average will get back to pre-pandemic levels of output before the year is out. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, can indulge his boss’s tantrums; his political position could hardly be stronger.

Long before he was a cinematographer, Roger Deakins was a photographer. The film-maker’s eye that has earned Deakins 15 Oscar nominations (and two Oscars) in celebrated work with the Coen brothers, Sam Mendes and others first found its expression in documentary photography of rural north Devon in the early 1970s.
Some of those formative pictures of farm hands and country fairs are collected in the first monograph of Deakin’s photography work. They take their place alongside images such as this one, which was taken on the set of The Reader, the film of Bernhard Schlink’s Holocaust novel, made in Germany in 2007. Although Deakins says he often used a still camera to take photographs of locations or to plan lighting rigs for particular scenes, occasionally, off duty and off set, he returned to his first vocation, just looking for little moments that captured his attention.

The question I am a 43-year-old woman. I have a happy marriage and amazing kids. During lockdown my 76-year-old mother, who is a widow, has coped well, launching herself into reading, gardening and clearing out stuff in the house, with never a word of self-pity.
Now that things have opened up and we can visit again, the distance requires that we stay over. My problem is that, on returning to my childhood home, I revert to being a teenager.

‘The number of ex-players being diagnosed is frightening’

The former Liverpool and England midfielder Terry McDermott has revealed he has been diagnosed with dementia. McDermott, 69, announced on Liverpool’s website that he is in the early stages of Lewy body dementia.
“I’ve got to get on with it and I will. It’s the way I’ve been brought up. Nothing has come to me easily,” McDermott said. “I’m not frightened of taking it on and also, as we’ve seen, there are a lot of former players in a worse state than me.

It is credited with preventing the worst global recession since at least the second world war from turning into something far worse. But after the injection of trillions of dollars into financial markets to cushion the blow from Covid-19, the era of quantitative easing could be coming to an end.
This week, attention will turn to the gathering of central bank chiefs in Jackson Hole for clues about how the US Federal Reserve plans to bring its vast QE bond-buying programme to an eventual halt after more than a year of emergency stimulus.

Israeli aircraft struck Hamas sites in Gaza late on Saturday, the military said, in an escalation of hostilities after earlier cross-border gunfire seriously injured an Israeli soldier and wounded 41 Palestinians, including two critically.
The injuries came during a Gaza protest organised by the enclave’s Islamist rulers, Hamas, and other factions in support of Jerusalem, where Palestinian clashes with Israeli police helped spark an 11-day Israel-Hamas conflict in May.

Afghanistan is facing an “absolute catastrophe” involving widespread hunger, homelessness and economic collapse unless an urgent humanitarian effort is agreed in the wake of the US withdrawal, world leaders are warned today.
With growing anger over Britain’s chaotic evacuation effort and people killed in a crush around Kabul airport yesterday, a meeting of G7 leaders has been hastily arranged for early this week. Senior figures in Kabul warned that the latest chaos is combining with drought, huge displacements of people and economic paralysis to create a disaster requiring immediate international action.

Even Jorginho finds the idea that he could win the Ballon d’Or this year hard to accept. He did not take it as an insult when he heard Antonio Cassano, the former Italy striker, say that any journalist who votes for the Chelsea midfielder “should have his licence taken away”.
Instead of picking a fight with Cassano after finding him on an Italian beach earlier this summer, Jorginho found common ground with the 39-year-old, agreeing that it would be a scandal if he takes the Ballon d’Or off Lionel Messi. “Now I admire Jorginho even more,” Cassano said last week. “We were talking for a good 90 minutes. He is an exceptional guy: very intelligent, humble and polite.”

The celebrated leader Ole Gunnar Solskjær channels most often is Alex Ferguson, not Theodore Roosevelt, but even as he seeks to borrow from his mentor’s blueprint, the Manchester United manager turned to a past US president to argue Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford should be spared the sort of vitriolic reception that greeted David Beckham after the 1998 World Cup.
While Rashford is sidelined by a shoulder injury, Sancho, another to miss a penalty in England’s fateful Euro 2020 final shootout, could make his first appearance on enemy territory at St Mary’s on Sunday.

Paul Stirling’s 61 from 36 for the Brave was the game’s top score, with Ross Whiteley’s 44 off 19 adding a big finish. But could James Vince’s unrelenting roster of bowlers tame Phoenix’s merciless big-hitting?

The agency set up to investigate alleged war crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan is unlikely to be able to send investigators to the Taliban-led country for some time. 
Experts have described the fall of Afghanistan’s government as a setback to potential evidence-gathering activities stemming from the Brereton report, even though it is possible the Taliban would be receptive to such investigations.

Until that moment the now 31-year-old had romanticised Australia. As a young engineering student in Brazil he had been working to develop methods to safely recycle old photovoltaic (PV) solar cells but when he tried to take it outside the lab, he found himself hamstrung.

                    <span>With fans back at the Emirates, Sunday’s derby with Chelsea will show how much goodwill the manager has in reserve
Everybody wants their own Pep Guardiola. Everybody wants to find a former player, steeped in the traditions of the club, who can bring great success, preferably by using products of the academy. But the problem with geniuses is that there aren’t many of them about.
It’s also the problem of clubs: for all the talk of identities and DNA, very few of them actually have a cogent philosophy that binds first team to youth sides, or at least not one that has been in place for long enough to turn out a player who can return almost two decades after their debut to find an academy still turning out players shaped by the same prevailing idea.

Keir Starmer has told Labour that it has to modernise and become “the party of the next 10 or 20 years” if it is to stand a chance of winning the next election, as he vowed to place winning above his popularity across the party.
In an interview with the Observer after a summer tour in which he met voters his party has lost in recent elections, the Labour leader said he would use the forthcoming annual conference to paint “in primary colours” the kind of country a new Labour government would champion.

Lauds ‘generous’ Gabriel Jesus for role in 5-0 win over Norwich

Pep Guardiola challenged Jack Grealish to copy Raheem Sterling and become as prolific as his new teammate after he opened his Manchester City account on his home debut.
Grealish became the first £100m player to score in the Premier League when he kneed in City’s second goal in a 5-0 thrashing of Norwich, getting the champions a belated first win after losing to Leicester in the Community Shield and then Tottenham last week.

                    <span>Admitting cowardice is a subversive act within cultures that demand lip service
Most of us aren’t brave. We wouldn’t protest in the streets of Kabul as armed and triumphant clerical reactionaries fingered their guns. I am hardly breaking news when I say that fear makes us keep our heads down and conform. But how we conform makes a world of difference. Oppressive regimes, organisations and political cultures insist that we pretend to go along with them willingly. On occasion, the most courageous way to fight them is simply to admit we are afraid.
Outside abusive personal relationships, fear produces sycophantic subservience in two areas that dominate life in otherwise safe and democratic countries. In most workplaces, managers allow little or no free discussion or criticism. The cases of dictatorial power that have become famous are when managerial megalomania has led corporations to disaster – Enron, for instance, or NatWest. But anyone who looks honestly at their working lives will accept that in many hierarchies most of the time men and women in superior positions demand subservience and, like absolute monarchs, are shocked when they do not receive it.

The final major of 2021 may deliver the most extraordinary story of all. In among the big names on a gloriously tight leaderboard at the Women’s Open sits Louise Duncan, the 21-year-old amateur champion. The only time Duncan had cause to frown on day three here was when she was reminded she is not eligible for the £640,000 bounty on offer to any professional winner. “Thanks for that,” said Duncan, a University of Stirling student. “I could be drowning my sorrows tomorrow, tears rolling down my face.”
Imagine being so tantalisingly close to such riches one cannot claim.

A murder investigation has been launched after a man was stabbed to death in south-west London. The 22-year-old was found after police were called out at 3.45am on Saturday to reports of a disturbance in Clarence Street, Kingston.
The Metropolitan police said a 19-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and possession of an offensive weapon, while an 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both men are in custody at a south London police station.

Alan Johnson grew up in working-class Notting Hill, London, in the 1950s, raised by his teenage sister after their mother’s death. He left school at 15 and worked as a postman, a union leader and a Labour MP and cabinet minister under Tony Blair. The spry author of four award-winning memoirs, retirement is not his style. He left politics in 2017 and now, at 71, is publishing his first work of fiction – a thriller – The Late Train to Gipsy Hill.
I gather you wanted to be a writer before you ever thought of becoming a politician?
When the Beatles’ Paperback Writer came out in 1966, I wanted to be a paperback writer. I’ve dedicated The Late Train to Gipsy Hill to my amazing English teacher ­– Peter Carlin. He had natural authority, a mellifluous voice and never went anywhere near the cane. I not only admired him, he was the first teacher I liked. He treated us as adults. I submitted short detective stories to him: Inspector Andrew and Mr Midnight. Mr Carlin said: “Alan, have you ever thought of sending these off?” When I got the inevitable rejections, he said: “Don’t give up. All great writers could paper their walls with rejection slips.” I sent him a facsimile of the book’s dedication for his 90th birthday.

A sex swing inspired by the floating palace hotel in Udaipur – it was what Swansea had been calling out for,” says Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen over the phone, the morning after last week’s debut episode of the long-awaited Changing Rooms reboot sashayed back to our screens. Its return, after a 17-year hiatus, comes on Channel 4 rather than its original BBC home.
Llewelyn-Bowen transformed an almost entirely beige living room into a peacock and flamingo-inspired space with shell chandeliers and suspended seat. It was, as it happened, what these Swansea residents wanted – and it is also one of the most talked-about programmes of the summer.

A preventative measure, the move would enable policymakers and affected populations to be more prepared for what are being described by experts as “silent killers.”

Some economic effects of the coronavirus are obvious. Pre-pandemic, the share of retail sales conducted online had taken around eight years to go from 10% to 20%, but then in nine months shot up to 36% in January 2021.
But perhaps more surprising was a recent dramatic headline from Bloomberg: “UK Wage Growth Hits a Record as Vacancies Pass 1 Million”. This was based on estimates from the Office for National Statistics’ monthly wages and salaries survey that average regular pay had increased by 7.4% over the past year. So why should we be cautious in interpreting this huge rise?

Coronavirus – latest updates

The Covid Delta variant has swept across south-east Asia over recent months, prompting lockdowns and overwhelming hospitals – from Malaysia to Thailand and Indonesia. Now the impact is being felt in the Philippines, just as the country’s chronic lack of health workers reaches a crisis point.
“The disease has become very aggressive,” said Michael Bilan, who works on a Covid ward in Manila. This time, patients tend to require a higher amount of oxygen, for longer, he said. The number of Covid patients is also at a record high: last week, 277 were receiving treatment. New wards have been opened to meet demand.

                    <span>The professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience discusses his work to develop a scientific explanation for how the brain conjures consciousness
For centuries, philosophers have theorised about the mind-body question, debating the relationship between the physical matter of the brain and the conscious mental activity it somehow creates. Even with advances in neuroscience and brain imaging techniques, large parts of that fundamental relationship remain stubbornly mysterious. It was with good reason that, in 1995, the cognitive scientist David Chalmers coined the term “the hard problem” to describe the question of exactly how our brains conjure subjective conscious experience. Some philosophers continue to insist that mind is inherently distinct from matter. Advances in understanding how the brain functions undermine those ideas of dualism, however.
Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, is at the leading edge of that latter research. His Ted talk on consciousness has been viewed more than 11m times. His new book, Being You, proposes an idea of the human mind as a “highly evolved prediction machine”, rooted in the functions of the body and “constantly hallucinating the world and the self” to create reality.

                    <span>Writing a diary is a great way to offload – and, if memory fails, it’s a wonderful window on the past
I still get funny looks from people when I mention that I keep a diary. Maybe the practice strikes them as shifty or weirdly old-fashioned. It’s true that I never feel more furtive than when my wife finds me writing it at our kitchen table – it’s like being spotted entering a confessional box in church. What exactly have I got to tell this black book about a life that we share all day, every day? What secrets can I possibly be keeping?
The answer: nothing of any great note, and yet so much of my life is in it. I started writing a journal (as I used to call it) when I went on holiday. Twenty years ago I decided to go full-time and since then I’ve kept it more or less every day. Why? I suppose it began as an experiment – and became an obligation. You can’t hold back time, but you can try to save the past from being completely erased. It often feels trivial to record things as they happen (a stray remark, hearing a song, fleeting moments of doom or delight), but later they may prove useful, or instructive, or amusing. It also maintains the illusion of diligence – that you’re not just pissing away the days. A diary is good exercise for the writing muscle, the way a pianist practises scales or a footballer does keepy-uppies. During lockdown, like everyone else, I got into routines that felt numbing in their repetition and diary-wise left me short of material. I took recourse to discussing the books and box sets I was involved with – not exactly Pepysian, but it got me through.

Joan Bennett may not be a Hollywood name that readily trips off the tongue. Blame an incident in 1951, when the man she was with, her agent and lover, Jennings Lang, got shot twice – once directly in the groin. Before it, Joan was a pioneering film-noir femme fatale, star of the films of Fritz Lang. She’d also just played Liz Taylor’s mother in Father of the Bride, and was building a career in TV. After the shooting, her career collapsed, never to fully recover. Lang’s attacker continued his career much like before. He was the film producer Walter Wanger, Bennett’s husband, to whom she would stay married for the next 14 years.

A driver was raped after she stopped to check if a child was safe after spotting an empty car seat in a layby, police have said.
Thames Valley police said the woman was raped in a layby on the A4 in Thatcham, Berkshire, opposite the junction with Cox’s Lane, in an attack late on 16 August.

                    <span>The ‘forever war’ has finished with a debacle. If this marks the end of American interventionism, what will take its place?
A few months ago there were US bases all over Afghanistan where you could immerse yourself in Americana, buy Coke and Snickers bars from vending machines and watch live sport on TV.
Now the outpost has shrunk to one side of Kabul airport, a chaotic remnant of a 20-year stay where rearguard troops are trying to salvage the last scraps of dignity and honour, seemingly tossed aside by the political leadership in Washington, by trying to extract American stragglers and Afghan allies. Those allies, once inspired by talk of democracy, women’s rights and the free press, are now faced with the awful life-and-death dilemmas of preserving evidence of their work for or with the US-led coalition, in the hope of last-minute salvation, or destroying it, in a bid to escape execution.

The North Atlantic measurably widened last week. The more Joe Biden tried to shift blame for the Afghan chaos, the bigger the gulf with America’s UK and European allies grew. This US president, who preaches the virtues of multilateralism yet acted on his own, has done more in a few weeks to undermine the western alliance than Donald Trump ever did with all his bluster.

                    <span>(The Last Music Co)
The late bandleader’s 70-year career packed in restless shifts of style, virtuoso skill and guest spots from jazz’s best
When Chris Barber died, aged 90, in March, he had only recently retired after leading a band for 70 years. You can’t celebrate that with an album and a few notes, especially with music as popular and wide-ranging as his. So what we have here is a package of four CDs and a book tracing Barber’s career as one track follows another. With its leader playing trombone, and occasionally double bass, Chris Barber’s Jazz Band combined New Orleans-style traditional jazz with whatever else caught his fancy. The results were sometimes quite spectacular.
The eighth of these 69 tracks, from 1956, has the band’s banjo player, Lonnie Donegan, singing Rock Island Line with bass and washboard accompaniment. It sparked a nationwide craze for amateur skiffle groups, without which there would have been no Beatles. Unlike other trad bands, Barber’s never got stuck in a rut. Every record, every tour was a fresh start. As the tracks roll on we hear blues, gospel, ragtime and guest stars such as Louis Jordan, Joe Harriott, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Dr John, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. One late recording, from 2010, features a lively Jools Holland.

                    <span>Renovating this old workhouse is a chance to let a designer’s imagination run free
As Victorian workhouses go, St Clement’s in Bow, east London, is unexpectedly beautiful. A grand ode to Italianate architecture, the building, which was also a former psychiatric hospital, is relishing its newfound revival as affordable housing, part of a regeneration project by the Greater London Authority. Just metres from the chaos and traffic of Mile End Road, the elegant courtyard and grounds of St Clement’s offer a hushed reverence to those living in this vast Grade II listed slice of 19th-century architecture and the sense of community is palpable.
Inside a ground-floor flat, sunlight floods across the sitting room of Tom Bax and his partner Dr Richard Cole, lighting up the bright hues that are painted on each arched window frame. Sculptural lighting, fitting for the elevation of these 19th-century rooms and a rich colourful narrative is interwoven throughout.

                    <span>Stockton-on-Tees is leading a radical rethink of our urban centres, which is now even more urgent as Covid takes its toll
A few months before the pandemic struck, Nigel Cooke found himself under incredulous interrogation at a Local Government Association get-together in Loughborough. As the Stockton-on-Tees councillor responsible for regeneration, it had been Cooke’s call to buy up a vast shopping centre that has dominated the town’s high street since the 1970s.
“Word had got round that we’d bought a shopping centre that had come on the market,” says Cooke. “The gist of the response from fellow councillors was: ‘Are you mad? There’s no future in shopping centres’. I said: ‘We’ve not bought it to run as a shopping centre. We’ve bought it to knock it down’. They said: ‘You’re even madder than we thought’. No one had thought of doing what we’re doing.”

                    <span>The road to Tokyo has been hard but the British wheelchair racer is confident she can add to her five Paralympic gold medals
Hannah Cockroft prepared for the Tokyo Paralympics in the best way she knows how: breaking world records. “Wait a minute …” she says, trying to pull together her performances at the World Para Athletics grand prix in Switzerland. “… so across the four I broke the 100, 200, 400 and 800. But over the four I broke them seven times.”
Cockroft has consistently been setting the bar ever higher since she announced herself to the world at the 2012 Paralympics. After the London Games she went seven years unbeaten in the four distances she competes at the T34 wheelchair category, winning five Paralympic gold medals. That solitary defeat, to her British teammate Kare Adenegan in 2019, caused her to rethink her approach and launch another period of dominance on the track. To call her a natural-born competitor may be underselling it.

                    <span>With Afghan citizens’ data now in the hands of the Taliban, assumptions about controls that check misuse of intelligence are wide of the mark
In the summer of 2013, shortly after Edward Snowden’s revelations about the surveillance capabilities of the American National Security Agency (NSA) began to appear, I had a private conversation with a former cabinet minister about the implications of the leaks. At one stage, I mentioned to him a remark attributed to a prime architect of some of the NSA systems – that they had taken the US to “a keystroke away from totalitarianism”. The MP scoffed at the idea. What I needed to remember, he told me, in that superior tone that toffs adopt when speaking to their gardeners, was that the US and the UK were “mature democracies”. In such polities, the chances of anyone coming to power who might have the inclination to use such power for sinister purposes was, he said, zero.
Three years later, the US elected Donald Trump. Five years after Trump, look around: an increasing number of democracies are now run by autocrats of various stripes. Think of Orbán in Hungary, the Law and Justice party in Poland, Duterte in the Philippines, Erdoğan in Turkey, Modi in India, Bolsonaro in Brazil and others in Latin America. None of these autocrats has any scruples about using intelligence collected by state agencies against critics, dissidents and potential opponents. In fact, they positively relish being just a keystroke away from totalitarian control.

Back then, Piketty’s work on inequality was reported all over the world and sparked soul-searching among elites from Wall Street to Main Street. Some were surprised that Xi was paying attention, too.

In the same week that this interview emerged, Craig topped Variety’s list of movie star salaries, reportedly earning $100m following the sale of two sequels to the highly enjoyable mystery Knives Out, which leaves a lot of giving away to do.

                    <span>Director Michael Sarnoski promises a revenge thriller but delivers something much quieter and more profound
A truffle-hunting pig has been kidnapped. Her grizzled owner, Rob (Nicolas Cage), abandons a quiet, off-grid life in the woods and sets out on a recovery mission, chauffeured by a yuppie-ish truffle buyer named Amir (Hereditary’s Alex Wolff, dressed in pale blue linen and a flashy Gucci belt). It is soon revealed that Rob is a former superstar chef.
Forget the title: this film isn’t really about a pig. Instead, it’s an understated indie drama more interested in nostalgia, daddy issues and the restaurant industry in Portland, Oregon. Co-writer and director Michael Sarnoski has an eye for unadorned natural beauty, and Patrick Scola’s sensual cinematography celebrates the golden light that streams through a kitchen window and the textures of the Pacific north-west’s autumn foliage. It appears Sarnoski values no-frills authenticity on the plate too, having Rob unleash a haughty diatribe against the pretensions of molecular gastronomy over a dish of scallops “bathed in the smoke of Douglas fir cones”.

Breakthroughs and booster shots: what you need to know

Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, has refused to apologise for blaming rising Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths on unvaccinated African Americans, comments one Black Houston official called “racist and flat out wrong”.

The importing to the UK of puppies aged under six months could be banned under tight new welfare standards proposed by the government. 
The pushback against the “grim trade” of puppy smuggling will prevent puppies from being separated from their mothers too early, which puts them at increased risk of illness and death, said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. They can currently be imported from 15 weeks old.

We grew up without money: two rooms and an outside loo. I remember shyly cowering behind the coal shed as Mum tried to photograph me, but by the age of four I was playing Mia Farrow’s daughter in The Great Gatsby. I loved the fantasy of acting, the contrast of the worlds in which I lived. It’s not that one was better, but going from life with not very much to this extravagant, surreal set opened my eyes to possibilities.
Dad was charming and a genius with numbers – he was also deep in the organised crime world. In the 60s, he worked with both the Kray twins (Reggie was my brother’s Godfather) and their arch enemies, the Richardsons. He went to prison quite a few times and Mum would never take us to visit him. Still, he was my dad who I loved deeply.

A government extremism adviser has admitted during a private meeting that it is wrong to label Extinction Rebellion (XR) supporters as “extreme”, despite the home secretary, Priti Patel, condemning the group as “criminals” who threaten the nation’s way of life.
John Woodcock, the former Labour MP who was asked by the Home Office this year to examine disruption and violence by extreme political groups, sought to reassure XR activists that he did not regard the movement as uniformly extreme during a Zoom video conference call last month. “You’re worried that I want to label everyone who supports XR as extremists and that is certainly not the case,” he said.

It was going to be the Pandemic Olympics; the cheerless games that would inspire ambivalence at best. And then sport did its thing. Despite the lack of crowds and the looming threat of Covid, Tokyo was amazing. It also became something else: the mental health Olympics.
When Simone Biles pulled out of the gymnastics events, she brought an unprecedented focus on the psychological challenges of elite sport. One of the greatest athletes of all time had decided to prioritise her mind over the will – and enormous pressure – to win. “There is more to life than just gymnastics,” she said. After taking stock in a Tokyo gym, she returned to the beam event, taking a bronze medal in what might have felt like one of her biggest victories.

If you wanted to launch an overt attack on 30-year-olds, I could think of little better than rebooting Gossip Girl (Wednesday 25 August, 10.35pm, BBC One; all episodes on iPlayer), a series that ran for five years between 2007 and 2012, made stars of Blake Lively, Penn Badgley and Leighton Meester, and introduced an entire generation to the concept of typing something mean very quickly on a BlackBerry. The screaming, crying, skull-cracking sound you can hear in the distance is a generation of original viewers – “But, hold on, they are remaking Gossip Girl? The series of my youth? They are remaking it because … 14 years have gone by? Meaning I am no longer … young?” – going through a profound existential crisis. If they can find time to, anyway, between planning their weddings or doing mortgage calculations on Santander’s website.

                    <span>Bromley, Kent: How we look at nature is very important. So I decided to look twice at this strange tree
Nature often shows that life and death are intertwined, and I have learned that what is important is how we perceive this. I went for a walk to my local woods. I loved the warm hug of the sun, the smell of refreshing rain-dampened grass and the soothing melodies of the birds. In that moment I was at peace, filled with a feeling of pure happiness and calm. Then I stumbled across a tree in the open field. It made me stop and think. I felt joy and sadness, because half of it was full of life and half was lifeless.
I stared and marvelled at how the tree could balance both life and death, yet still look so beautiful and serene. This made me realise how life and death coexist and that I had a choice to make on how I perceived this scene before me. Taking a deep breath, I looked at the tree again. This time I saw beauty throughout. On one side, the luscious leaves protected a bird’s nest. But also, the dead branches were serving as a perch for birds, and the hollow trunk was a shelter for small animals and a multitude of insects such as beetles. I saw positivity. What do you see?

A few dark clouds, remnants of the storm that whipped up the North Sea the night before, still hang in the big Lincolnshire skies, above a coastline famed for its kiss-me-quick holiday towns such as Skegness and Mablethorpe. But push on north towards Cleethorpes and the mouth of the Humber, past the caravan parks and imposing sea walls, and the shoreline becomes much wilder, a mix of mud flats and salt marshes, backed by a wide expanse of sand dunes frequented by a few hardy dog walkers.
This is the eastern outpost of Dynamic Dunescapes, a £10m project supported by Natural England and conservation groups including Plantlife and the Wildlife Trusts, which aims to bring new life to sand dunes, with a radical approach to their management.

The Taliban’s sweeping advance last week has sparked fears that Europe could face a migration crisis similar to that in 2015, with people fleeing persecution or further conflict.

Valmeyer was a small commuter town made up of mostly middle-class families who worked in nearby St Louis, Missouri. Almost overnight, the community became a model of what it means to become climate resilient.

Waking up in a mental institution is a strange experience made slightly more bearable by the drugs administered the night before arrival. It’s an odd sensation to come round on a ward – in my case, one at the Hollymoor psychiatric hospital in Birmingham – and not recognise your own body. It took a while for my hands, feet and legs to understand that they were attached to my body. I just lay there for an hour trying to make sense of what was going on.

                    <span>The speeches, the tears, the jokes, the dad dancing – after months of missing out on social events, it’s all wonderful
I went to a wedding at the weekend. That shouldn’t be a remarkable statement, but of course it is. It’s been a strange summer: the promise of normal life returning hasn’t quite materialised. Instead it has felt tentative, cautious. So I wasn’t sure how this big social event would feel. There was no cap on numbers, no social distancing, no miserable insistence on everything being outside, despite the season’s atrocious weather. It was a proper wedding, in the old style. And it was wonderful.
After 18 months of deprivation, I forgot what it was like to feel part of a community. Robbed of really celebrating these major life milestones – birthdays and anniversaries, births and christenings, weddings and funerals – life has felt atomised and dreary. That sense of connection you get from being around other human beings, including those you don’t know well, has been absent. So a huge, unapologetic, exuberant wedding was always going to be quite the experience.

                    <span>If Brexit and Covid wasn’t enough, the extra cost of using a mobile in the EU is making a comeback
If you are planning a winter holiday elsewhere in Europe this year, get ready to pay more to use your mobile phone while away – as roaming charges are about to make a very unwelcome comeback.
Having repeatedly indicated in the run-up to Brexit that they had no intention of reintroducing roaming charges for UK customers heading to mainland Europe, EE and Vodafone have recently announced that customers will start paying to use their phones in the EU from January onwards.

Not so long ago it may have seemed more like a futuristic vision of the workplace – or a hospital.
But the hands-free door handles, self-cleaning surfaces, antimicrobial paint, air-monitoring display tools, UV light disinfection robots, and 135 other measures at an office block in Bucharest are here to stay, say the creators behind what they are touting as one of the world’s most virus-resilient workplaces, which they hope will become the new normal in office design.

                    <span>There are plenty of tourists, but UK hospitality firms are plagued by labour shortages this summer
For Lynton, a small village perched on a picturesque hill overlooking the north Devon coast, this year’s summer tourist season has been exceptional. Holidaymakers from all over the UK have descended in huge numbers, arriving by coach, by car and on foot.
The scenes are perhaps unsurprising, given how many households have decided against international travel this year when faced with the expense and uncertainty of Covid rules. In July, the Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that an extra £30.5bn and 300,000 jobs would be injected into British travel and hospitality sectors if tourists across Europe switched foreign holidays for domestic ones – with Devon one of the biggest recipients of this shift.

Jesy Nelson is having her photo taken. For the first time in her career, it’s all about her. She is no longer one quarter of the hugely successful girl group Little Mix. Nelson is about to release her first solo single and she says she is happier than she has been in years. But you wouldn’t know it: she looks painfully self-conscious, unsmiling and anxious.
Photos done, she disappears to change clothes. When she returns, she’s unrecognisable. Dressed in black T-shirt, leggings and platform trainers, Nelson is all smiles; warm, giggly and uninhibited. I tell her I’ve never seen such a contrast. She laughs. “When I’m in front of a camera, I don’t know what to do. The other three girls would be in the weirdest positions and look fabulous. If I did it, I’d look awful.”

                    <span>Vaccine efficacy against infection is waning slightly with time – but efficacy against severe symptoms remains strong
Federal health authorities have recommended booster shots for all adults who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with either the the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, citing evidence that suggests breakthrough infections could become more common over time.
The plan has faced scrutiny. Some US scientists have said data was insufficient to support the decision, and vaccines remain highly effective against severe disease requiring hospitalization and death. The World Health Organization harshly criticized US leaders for using vaccines to provide a third shot to people, even as most around the world haven’t had one.

For Donald Trump, the former US president, beating the drum of “America first” was something of an obsession. “The future doesn’t belong to the globalists,” he once told the UN. “The future belongs to patriots.”
Last year, he was rejected by voters in favour of Joe Biden, a committed internationalist who vowed: “America is back.” Yet the past week has shaken the faith of old allies and led some to question whether a strain of the “America first” mantra lives on.

There were 536 serious incident reports in England during 2020/21, up 87 (19%) from 449 in 2019/20, and an increase of 41% on the number of incidents recorded five years ago. Children aged under one accounted for 36% of notifications last year.

The inscription on the gravestone proudly attests to how far Marcus Venerius Secundio, a former slave of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, went in life. In order of importance, he lists his achievements after being liberated. The first was his role as custodian of the Temple of Venus, built soon after the creation of Pompeii as a Roman colony.
He also joined the ranks of the Augustales, a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship. But perhaps the most telling indication of his eventual status was that he financed entertainment events in Greek and Latin.

At least 12,000 people have been evacuated via Kabul airport since the start of a tumultuous rescue effort last Sunday. They include a mix of western government staff and aid agency workers, as well as Afghan residents who have worked with western governments or their agencies, or are perceived to be particularly at risk due to the nature of their work, such as journalists, translators or human rights activists.

                    <span>Royal Court, London
Dutch singer Wende performs songs conceived by playwrights – on topics from bloody battles to online dating – with magnetism and a talent for storytelling
In this glorious experiment with mixed results, five playwrights – EV Crowe, Sabrina Mahfouz, Somalia Nonyé Seaton, Stef Smith and Debris Stevenson – were asked for ideas for songs, the brief no stricter than that. Conceived by Chloe Lamford, the result is an ethereal, mishmashed concert with an always brilliant band and bewitching lead singer, but varied quality of songs and lack of a through-thread.
The show – which I see a preview of – is meant to be in the much larger auditorium downstairs, but flooding has pushed it to the Court’s smaller space upstairs. The intimate nature is perfectly suited to the cosy show, with the band clustered in a circle, their instruments almost on top of each other, the audience crowded on three sides. When we’re encouraged to join in for a chorus (don’t worry, participation is minimal), there’s a sense of being gathered round a crackling fire.

St Helens score four tries in one-sided victory

There has been no shortage of unforgettable performances to settle derby matches between Wigan and St Helens in years gone by. And while this was a comprehensive victory for the reigning Super League champions, the clearest indicator yet about the gulf in class between these two famous clubs at present is that, really, St Helens had to be nowhere near faultless to inflict such an embarrassing defeat on their great rivals.
Wigan’s inconsistency has haunted them throughout 2021 while the Saints have lost only three games in all competitions as they relentlessly kept up their push for the treble here. But one stat above all else sums up this miserable performance from the Warriors: on the night they received more yellow cards than they scored points.

After the fractured skull and eye socket came the ankle ligament damage. Kevin De Bruyne has spent the summer being hurt, returning from injury and playing through the pain barrier.
His Premier League campaign began as his Euro 2020 ended, with De Bruyne a fitness doubt. He made a swifter-than-expected recovery – another recurring theme – to play for the last 12 minutes in Sunday’s defeat at Tottenham. But he missed training on Friday, leaving Pep Guardiola unsure if his talisman will face Norwich on Saturday. The Etihad Stadium will be packed for the first time since a De Bruyne masterclass against West Ham in February 2020, but he may be a spectator as his stop-start year continues. He is becoming a constant concern.

                    <span>Liverpool hope to reward Egypt international’s prolific form
‘I am involved in pretty much everything in club,’ manager says

Jürgen Klopp has confirmed talks are under way on a new contract for Mohamed Salah as Liverpool look to reward the Egypt international’s prolific form and end speculation over his Anfield future.
The 29-year-old has two seasons remaining on his current contract, an incentivised deal worth up to £200,000 a week, and would be expected to receive a significant increase given his influence on the team and his global status. Liverpool have secured Virgil van Dijk, Alisson, Fabinho and Trent Alexander-Arnold on new long-term extensions recently and Klopp said last week that he expects Jordan Henderson, the captain, to follow suit. The Liverpool manager has confirmed he is also involved in efforts to extend Salah’s hugely successful Anfield career.

For the long-suffering Rockets fans, the agonising wait for a Lord’s final goes on for another year.

The White House’s readout of a call between Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron on the crisis in Afghanistan leaves out an impassioned plea from the French president that the US and its allies have a “moral responsibility” to evacuate Afghan allies.
The French government’s readout of the conversation was released on Friday, a day after the call took place, and indicates that Macron emphasised ensuring the safe evacuation of Afghan citizens who assisted American and European troops over the past 20 years at great risk to themselves and their families.

                    <span>Resistance to measures to limit disease spread are part of history. How extreme they are depends on what leaders do, and what they allow
In the pandemic’s second year, a transnational, conspiracy-minded protest movement is becoming more vocal, and in some cases more violent, in pushing back on measures to limit the spread of new variants of the Covid-19 virus. False beliefs about the vaccines and the virus can now spread worldwide on the internet at the speed of thought. For this reason, many have pointed to online disinformation as the motor of of antivax protests.
That may be so but in other ways the protesters are following patterns which have been observed throughout recorded human history, which has seen civilisations rise and fall to the rhythm of novel epidemics.

It’s a blustery Wellington night and we’re on the brink of the second nationwide lockdown of the pandemic. There’s a measured knock at my flat door. Jemaine Clement shakes my hand warmly and removes his boots. We’re meeting off the back of the global success of his comedy series Wellington Paranormal and he is in an ebullient mood. He’s also in a thirsty one: tonight the former door-to-door orange juice salesman is plumping for copious glasses of water instead. 
Paranormal is one of two spinoffs from his and Taika Waititi’s vampire film What We Do in the Shadows. It stars Shadows’ police officers Minogue (Mike Minogue) and O’Leary (Karen O’Leary), recruited for the paranormal unit by Sgt Ruawai Maaka (Maaka Pohatu). The trio, and their colleague Const Parker (Tom Sainsbury), are oblivious, bungling and affable. Clement explains the importance of Paranormal being a collegial shoot.

                    <span>Like a bizarro David Beckham, anything that could go wrong for the Manchester United defender has tended to do just that
The straw that appears to have broken the camel’s back could scarcely have been more innocuous. On the first Sunday of October 2017, Phil Jones tweeted a reply to Simon Wood, a Masterchef-winning restaurateur who had used Twitter to flag up the presence of the Manchester United defender in his premises earlier that evening. “Fantastic food,” wrote Phil, by way of acknowledgement for the shout-out. “Me and the wife will be back soon. Thank you.”
It was in keeping with the kind of mundane to and fro in which Jones occasionally engaged on a social media account that seemed to be curated by the player himself rather than a team of in-house social media strategists. Promotional tweets, presumably posted at the behest of his sponsors Adidas, were occasionally punctuated by birthday greetings and other supportive messages for strangers and colleagues alike. Not the kind of content a man would expect to get his two million followers exercised.

A government source said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, expects teachers to be able to tackle the risks from incel culture through the relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) curriculum within schools.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Retailers are warning of further disruption on Britain’s high streets from shortages of stock caused by Covid and Brexit, after official figures revealed an unexpected fall in sales last month.
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said there were mounting problems for the industry after a month when a hoped-for rise in spending following the end of most pandemic restrictions failed to materialise.

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has hit the highest annual level in a decade, a new report has shown, despite increasing global concern over the accelerating devastation since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019.
Between August 2020 and July 2021, the rainforest lost 10.476 square kilometers – an area nearly seven times bigger than greater London and 13 times the size of New York City, according to data released by Imazon, a Brazilian research institute that has been tracking the Amazon deforestation since 2008. The figure is 57% higher than in the previous year and is the worst since 2012.

Jacinto Romero Flores, who covered politics and crime in the municipality of Zongolica, was shot dead in the township of Ixtaczoquitlán on Thursday.

                    <span>Car salesman Paul Drummond lets American slip into gear
England’s Georgia Hall shares halfway lead with Mina Harigae

It doesn’t seem to have been much of a hardship for Paul Drummond to take a week off from his family’s car sales business in Carnoustie. Drummond, a 31-year-old plus-two handicap who caddies at the championship links in his spare time, finds himself on the bag for Lexi Thompson at the Women’s Open. The spontaneous alliance is working a treat thus far; Thompson added a 70 to Thursday’s 69 to ease into contention on the Angus coast. Drummond, in branded gear, looks every bit the tour caddie.
Thompson’s regular looper, Jack Fulghum, was unwell amid severe heat at the Olympics. It appears the partnership may have formally ended in any case. Thompson made contact with the Carnoustie caddie master last weekend, with Drummond duly recommended for the highest-profile role of his “other” job. Even the language barrier has delivered no problems. “He speaks very slowly to me,” said the Floridian Thompson of her Scottish assistant. “I’m fully trusting him on his numbers and whether to hit it left or right of the pin and he has been spot on.”

                    <span>Painter of huge portraits that explored the relationship between painting and photography
In the 1960s Chuck Close, fresh from art school, was sitting in a New York restaurant when Jasper Johns walked in, passing by his fellow diners in total anonymity despite the older painter’s great fame. After seven decades of self-portraits, Close, who has died aged 81, never suffered the same fate, his face recognisable to generations of museum-goers. In 2017 this storied career abruptly ended following sexual misconduct allegations.
Close painted on a huge scale, the acrylics or oils flatly applied with little discernible brushstrokes. He always started with a photograph as source material, rigidly divided by an overlaid grid, which he would replicate, colours and forms, square by square, on to canvas using a variety of tools including razorblades, electric drills and airbrushes. The artist also brought the faces of his peers from obscurity, completing portraits of Kiki Smith, Alex Katz, Cindy Sherman, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists, as well as the more readily recognisable Barack Obama, Al Gore, Brad Pitt and Kate Moss.

A relative was shot in the head in the melee of people trying to leave, and so she spent the evening trudging to a market to buy alcohol and gauze for his wounds. The hospital had run out.

The Plymouth gunman was not charged or cautioned after he carried out a vicious assault in a city park last year, but instead was allowed to take part in a four-month rehabilitation scheme, it has emerged.
Jake Davison’s legally held shotgun was confiscated after he began the Pathfinder scheme and a worker from it found out he had the weapon and informed Devon and Cornwall police. But the shotgun was handed back last month after he finished the programme.

                    <span>Vast disparities in income may have lost some of their power to shock. But they remain a gross injustice
Public anger about the vast salaries extracted from business by the highest-paid people surfaces less often than one might expect, given highly conspicuous levels of inequality and rising poverty. Sir Philip Green and Fred Goodwin are rare in having become notorious big earners: Sir Philip because of the collapse of BHS, as well as his own inflated rewards and oligarchic lifestyle; Mr Goodwin because he exemplified a greedy banker type at a time when anger at banks was at its peak.
More recently, a colossal £75m bonus paid to the chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, resulted in his departure from the business. But Mr Fairburn – who was reported earlier this year to have failed to keep a promise to set up a charity – did not become a household name.

Dominic Raab appears to have been saved this week by Boris Johnson’s exceptionally high threshold for sacking ministers. For now, the foreign secretary has joined the reshuffle waiting room, sitting in ministerial limbo alongside Gavin Williamson and Priti Patel.
The prime minister has faced pressure from within his own party as well as from the opposition to remove them all – over Williamson’s failure on exams for two years in a row, the finding that Patel bullied staff, and Raab’s ill-advised holiday at the height of an international crisis.

                    <span>The past year has rightly shifted the way that cultural value is estimated
In living memory, there has been no worse year for museums and galleries, along with many other arts organisations. With closure forced on them by the pandemic, they were unable to earn money from ticket sales, shops or cafes; when they reopened for a time last summer, and again this spring, they had to cope with reduced footfall and the costs of expensive interventions to render them Covid-safe. Some of their funders, especially local authorities, have suffered gravely too, with cuts at times passed on.
The Museums Prize, run by the charity Art Fund, has a distinguished history of rewarding excellence in British institutions. Often in the past the focus has been on multimillion-pound, attention-grabbing capital projects. The past two years, though, have seen a shift in the focus of the prize – one that may portend a wider change of emphasis in how cultural value is estimated. In 2020, the prize, which was already in process when the pandemic hit, was split between the shortlisted candidates, the prize money having been doubled to £200,000. This year, entrants were asked three simple questions: what did you do that showed imagination and determination? How do you think this made a difference? How will you build on this in the future?

                    <span>Literary prize culture favours young and marketable writers – and the new Futures scheme is simply adding to the problem
Last week, the Women’s prize announced a new award in partnership with Good Housekeeping magazine. “Futures” will provide promotional support to 10 female writers of fiction in the UK and Ireland who have published one book. The award, however, has an age limit of 35.
It’s great to encourage young writers, so what’s the problem? The arts world is already deluged with age-limited awards. Big prizes include the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year award (for under-35s), the Dylan Thomas (for under-39s) and the Rooney prize (for under-40s) in Ireland. There are also a host of smaller age-limited grants, residencies and other opportunities, not to mention publicity campaigns similar to Futures, such a Granta’s Best Young British Novelists (for under-40s) and their Best Young Spanish Novelists (who, for some reason, have to make it even faster, by the age of 35). The assumption, it seems, is that older writers are so culturally or financially secure that they have no need for money or recognition.

                    <span>Readers respond to a feature on women forced out of work by menopause and a report on suggestions that menopause should be a protected characteristic under the Equality Act
Middle-aged women and others going through the menopause experience unacceptable discrimination. However, the law as it stands means legal cases challenging menopause-related discrimination need to be brought on grounds of sex, age or disability.
If the law currently works inadequately, should menopause be added to the list of grounds recognised by the Equality Act 2010 (Equality laws could be changed to protect women in menopause, says MP, 18 August)? In our view, menopause-based discrimination highlights instead the relevance and value of an “intersectional” approach. This recognises that discrimination is often due to a combination of social biases. Kimberlé Crenshaw, who developed the term in the late 1980s, focused on the disadvantages that black women faced and the inadequate response of American anti-discrimination law to their experiences.

                    <span>The legacy of Boris Johnson’s initial approach to the pandemic can be measured in lives needlessly lost and ruined, says Michael Rosen
Your report on US officials’ reaction to Boris Johnson’s initial coronavirus policy, to aim for herd immunity (Trump team thought UK officials ‘out of their minds’ aiming for herd immunity, book says, 19 August), confirms what many of us have been saying for some time. If we follow the timeline of what he said and did in the months leading up to the first lockdown of 16 March last year, we can indeed see quite clearly that herd immunity was the first go-to policy.
Some examples: Johnson saying on 3 February that he was against “market segregation” as a way of dealing with the coronavirus – in other words, he was against a government-led intervention policy that might hamper trade. Later, on 3 March, he described how safe it was to shake hands with Covid patients and said that he would go on doing so. On 12 March, Robert Peston, presumably armed with his usual first-hand knowledge, wrote in the Spectator how herd immunity was the policy of the day. As late as 13 March, government scientists, speaking on BBC Two’s Newsnight and Radio 4’s Today programme, spoke openly of herd immunity as being the inevitable or necessary approach.

Morrisons shares have surged again as investors bet the £7bn price tag on the company could go higher still amid a private equity bidding war for control.
They closed up 4% at 291p, 6p more than the 285p a share offer lodged on Thursday by US group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R). The £7bn offer is £300m more than the £6.7bn on the table from rival suitor’s Fortress but the share price move suggests the winner may have to dig even deeper as that 6p equates to more than £150m.

More than 9,000 Covid infections were linked to Euro 2020 football games monitored for the government’s mass events test scheme, and scientists have said the tournament generated “a significant risk to public health”.
An analysis of the third and final stage of the research programme, released on Friday, found that more than 85% of all the infections connected to the 49 days of various outdoor sport, music and entertainment events came from the eight Euros games involved, and mainly the semi-final and final.

                    <span>The UK’s most popular expletive has changed after a 27% drop in cursing over 20 years
So it’s farewell to bloody Nora. The f-word has become Britain’s most popular swearword, overtaking “bloody”, as the nation’s use of expletives has dropped over the past two decades, a linguistics study has found.
Data on the use of 16 swearwords in the 1990s and the 2010s shows the f-word was the most frequently used, taking the title from “bloody” which was beaten into third place by “shit”.

Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries not interfere in Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul, saying the west “must stop the irresponsible policy of imposing foreign values from abroad”.
In extended remarks, Putin said he hoped the Taliban would “guarantee the security of locals and foreign diplomats” and that the country would not break apart after the withdrawal of US-led forces.

Jonnie Peacock has a new look for 2021. His blond hair is no longer in a nice schoolboy short back and sides, but tied in an unruly topknot. He has a wiry beard to go with it too. He looks less like he’s about to challenge for a third consecutive sprint title at the Paralympics, than lead a horde of Vikings on a spot of light pillaging.

                    <span>Face blindness meant the photorealist artist, who has died aged 81, had to dismantle and reconstitute, making every cell of his pixellated portraits ever more dramatic

Chuck Close, painter of outsized photorealist portraits, dies aged 81

Hugely enlarged, Chuck Close stares back at you from behind his glasses, a cigarette lodged in the corner of his mouth. It is a face with a what-you-looking-at stare, and you look back, dwarfed by his image, thinking get-out-of-my-face in return.
Taking us from the top of his head to his sprouting chest hair, via every pore and bristle, the artist’s unkempt anti-grooming and non-coiffure, the trickle of smoke exhaled from his nostril, Close’s 1967-8 Big Self-Portrait charts every centimetre of his black and white photograph, which was gridded, enlarged and copied on to the canvas, then painted using a spray gun. All the aberrations of the original photograph, with its blank background and out-of-focus ear, are retained in the painting. The tip of the smouldering cigarette looms out at you. It makes you want to duck. Painted when Close was in his late 20s, the self-portrait was Close’s big move, both calling card and confrontation.

Spain has offered itself as the EU’s hub to take in Afghans who have collaborated with its institutions over the years, as Germany said there was an emerging consensus within the bloc to also ease passage for a limited number of other people in need of protection from Taliban reprisals.
However, migration experts warned that the vast majority of Afghan citizens already displaced by the fighting that brought the new regime to power will be left stranded unless European states proactively work to negotiate a safe corridor out of the country.

As the story goes, Jason Statham’s impromptu standing back somersault during a real-life pub lock-in with Guy Ritchie was not only the inspiration for a scene in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but also ended up launching his career. “Before all of his fame with the movies and everything, he was a proper diver who trained at Crystal Palace,” recalls Gill Snode, a co-founder of Crystal Palace diving club.
Yet while Statham went all the way to Hollywood after being one of the thousands of promising young athletes who trained at the National Sports Centre, south London’s current crop of divers appears to have been forgotten.

                    <span>Our battle to restore a statement to a Manchester exhibition was really about what can and can’t be said in cultural spaces
On Wednesday, protesters in Manchester reclaimed one of the city’s main cultural institutions. Despite the rain, pro-Palestine activists gathered in front of the closed doors of the Whitworth gallery, part of the University of Manchester. It was because of their persistent action, and 13,000 letters sent to the gallery, that part of our exhibition, a printed statement titled “Forensic Architecture stands with Palestine”, has been reinstated. The exhibition, which we insisted be shut as a result of the statement’s unilateral removal, has now reopened.
On Sunday 15 August, a blog post on the website of UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) announced that, following the group’s intervention, the statement had been removed from our exhibition, Cloud Studies. When we first heard of the news, we were not altogether surprised. The same group had already criticised a statement of solidarity with Palestinians published on the Whitworth’s website in June, and succeeded in convincing the university to have it removed. And this was hardly UKLFI’s first attack on us as an organisation. In 2018, when we were nominated for the Turner prize, UKLFI urged the Tate not to award the prize to us on the outrageous grounds that documents that we had published in relation to Palestine amounted to “modern blood libels likely to promote antisemitism and attacks on Jews”.

The ongoing disaster in Afghanistan is only the latest fiasco to provoke fury at the unseriousness of Boris Johnson’s government. In fact, for the past 20 years British and American conservatism has seemed ever more unrealistic: its policies ever more like fantasies, its relationship with the truth ever looser, its leaders ever less focused and competent.
This persistent unrealism has had terrible costs. And yet, without seeming to have mastered the basics of governing, conservatives still win plenty of elections, and dominate how politics is talked and thought about. To many voters and commentators, conservative government, however much it fails in practice, is still the realistic option.

                    <span>New releases by three pop icons reveal their extreme attempts to protect themselves from the damage caused by fame. Pop stardom has never seemed less aspirational
The mechanisms of pop stardom have never been subject to as much scrutiny as they are now. Britney Spears’ conservatorship struggle exposed their potential for (alleged) abuse. Raye recently split from her major label, Polydor, after she reached breaking point and shared her frustrations about not being allowed to release her debut album despite signing in 2014 and helming numerous massive hit singles. Former X Factor winner Rebecca Ferguson has called for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged widespread music industry wrongdoing. That labels should root out exploitative and predatory behaviour and protect exposed young stars is a baseline requirement. But increasingly it seems that the existential state of pop stardom – particularly for young women, subject to greater scrutiny than their male peers and often held to contradictory standards – is intolerable beyond any level of protection.

Murdoch’s News UK business complained that a BBC Two documentary unfairly suggested the Australian-born media mogul “exercised malign political influence” through his ownership of news outlets. It said the BBC programme was biased and failed to give enough weight to more positive appraisals of Murdoch’s career.

                    <span>Excitement is building for the Games even in this strange fifth year of the cycle with athletes facing mounting pressure
There’s still something inside me that knows it’s a Games year. Even though I last competed at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, it’s almost like my body has become attuned to being ready. You wake up and there’s this feeling: “Wow, I know something special is happening.” And that’s true even in this strange, fifth year of the cycle.
I have a sense of excitement as the Games approaches, but – fortunately – I don’t have any of the pressures; the pressures of qualifying for the Games and now of making sure you’re ready for them. It’s about this point in the buildup that athletes start to really worry. You’re trying to get your form right. But you’re also paranoid about getting injured, and about staying away from anyone who might have a cold. This year, of course, there is Covid to think of too. You catch that, you’re potentially out of the Games or even worse. I can’t imagine what it must be like getting ready for Tokyo right now, people must have wrapped themselves in cotton wool.

Police preparing for a new campaign of Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests in London have said they will not be deterred by a recent supreme court ruling that obstruction can be a legitimate and lawful form of protest.
The Ziegler judgment, handed down by the supreme court in June, had ruled that the exercising of protest rights could constitute a “lawful excuse” for obstructing the highway, even if the protest is considered disruptive.

Protests have erupted in Pakistan’s port city Gwadar against a severe shortage of water and electricity and threats to livelihoods, part of a growing backlash against China’s multibillion-dollar belt and road projects in the country.
This week, demonstrators including fishers and other local workers blocked the roads in Gwadar, a coastal town in Balochistan. They burned tyres, chanted slogans and largely shut down the city, to demand water and electricity and a stop to Chinese trawlers illegally fishing in the nearby waters and then taking the fish to China. Two people were injured when the authorities cracked down on the protesters.

About nine in 10 people in the UK are still wearing face coverings at least some of the time despite them no longer being compulsory, official figures show.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) data suggests face coverings in some settings could be one of the Covid-enforced changes to daily life in the UK that remain after the pandemic has subsided.

My wife and I have decided to move with our two young sons to her home country. It was a difficult decision and we spent a long time making it, but we believe it’s an opportunity for a better life that we have to take now.
My mother-in-law is not well and we have not seen my wife’s family for two years. However, my parents are struggling to accept our decision. They doubt the wisdom of the move, and initially took the view that my wife had pressured me into going. My wife found this hurtful; especially that my parents did not appreciate why she might want to spend time with her own mother. I was also infuriated by the notion that I was incapable of making such a momentous decision with my eyes open – and in support of my wife. I have kept all this from my parents because I do not want conflict and to leave in such an atmosphere.

Wes Streeting can’t claim to be his inner-city comp’s most famous alumni. That claim goes to the Hollywood actor John Boyega who, like the shadow child poverty secretary, also came from a council estate and went on to Westminster City school, which was in special measures during Streeting’s time.
Now, Streeting says, opportunities are rapidly diminishing for state school pupils like them. His own school has had to make hard choices about funding extracurricular activities, meaning after-school drama there – despite its Star Wars-famed alumnus – has been a casualty.

Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement would make it “impossible” for the UK government to refuse a second independence referendum but environmental campaigners expressed disappointment that the text fell short of calling for an immediate end to oil and gas exploration.

With reports of the Taliban going door to door searching for people who worked with the former Afghan government or western countries, claims have also emerged of Taliban fighters torturing and killing members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan after overrunning their village last month.

Commitments to reduce waiting times for diagnosing endometriosis from over eight years to less than 12 months, offer individual care plans after a woman’s first miscarriage and widen access to specialist menopause services form part of the Scottish government’s first women’s health plan, published on Friday.
The plan, which was informed by women’s own testimonies, is described as “the first stage of a long-term commitment to reducing health inequalities for women”. The 68-page document also pledges to appoint a national women’s health champion, establish a research fund to close gaps in scientific and medical knowledge and improve information and public awareness of heart disease symptoms and risks for women.

The Duke of York faces an “uphill struggle” to combat the impact of the sex offences allegations made against him and has already lost in the court of public opinion, leaving his reputation “highly tarnished” and a return to royal duties impossible, experts have said.
Following a damaging two weeks in which Andrew’s accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre lodged a civil lawsuit in New York alleging he had sex with her when she was 17, and a source claimed he was a “person of interest” in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, the duke is now caught “between a rock and a hard place,” said one expert.

What are workers’ rights if they are asked to go back?


As the pandemic struck wealthy economies in early 2020, workers (in white-collar jobs, at least) found themselves carrying out their duties from home. Now that vaccination programmes are continuing apace, more companies are grappling with how – and whether – to end the great enforced experiment in home working.
The answer is far from settled, with Apple telling its global workforce on Friday that they will not return to its corporate offices until January at the earliest, amid concern over the spread of new coronavirus variants. The tech company’s original plan to bring staff back in on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays in a hybrid home-working pattern had already been delayed from early September to October.

                    <span>Uncorrected proofs of upcoming novels have been selling for large sums on eBay and Depop – despite the practice being banned by publishers
When advance reading copies (ARCs) of Sally Rooney’s new novel Beautiful World, Where Are You were sent out in May, there was a flurry of social media posts. A lucky selection of editors, writers and influencers flaunted their copies; others bemoaned not having been granted one. Soon listings for proof copies (which are clearly marked “not for resale”) started to appear on trading sites such as eBay and Depop. One copy, listed on eBay by a seller in North Carolina, sold in June for $209.16. Even the canvas tote bag that Rooney’s publicists had been sending out with the ARC copies was fetching prices in the region of $80. And this growing market for unpublished novels is not just a product of Rooney-mania: Jonathan Franzen’s Crossroads, which will be published in October,  sold earlier this month on eBay for $124.
Advance copies of popular and classic novels have long been collector’s items. A rare proof copy of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, for example, or classics by authors such as Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck can sell for up to £30,000. But this high demand for ARCs of books that are yet to be published has only emerged recently, fuelled in part by the rise of book bloggers and influencers.

Newbies on the tiller have an obvious tell: they zig-zag down the canal. That’s because they don’t give time for the boat to respond to their steer – it does take a moment. Bear this in mind, be patient and avoid oversteering. Remember you moor, rather than park the boat, and the canalside is a towpath, not the “bank”. Put time into planning your route: working out where to finish every day (preferably by a pub), building in contingencies in case of rain or other hold-ups, as well as things to do on land and, for trips longer than a weekend, water points. Embrace the change of pace and give yourself over fully to the way of the canals, where 4mph is top speed! Let getting to the pub on time or finding a good mooring spot be your priorities and try to leave everything else at home. David Lawrence, civil servant, London

                    <span>Precipitation was so unexpected, scientists had no gauges to measure it, and is stark sign of climate crisis
Rain has fallen on the summit of Greenland’s huge ice cap for the first time on record. Temperatures are normally well below freezing on the 3,216-metre (10,551ft) peak, and the precipitation is a stark sign of the climate crisis.
Scientists at the US National Science Foundation’s summit station saw rain falling throughout 14 August but had no gauges to measure the fall because the precipitation was so unexpected. Across Greenland, an estimated 7bn tonnes of water was released from the clouds.

The Home Office did not carry out any safety checks on the hotel where a five-year-old Afghan boy fell to his death, the Guardian has learned, amid calls for an independent inquiry into the suitability of his accommodation.
Mohammed Munib Majeedi died on Wednesday after falling out of a ninth-floor window at the OYO Metropolitan hotel in Sheffield city centre. He and his family had been placed in the hotel by the Home Office as part of a scheme to relocate Afghans who had helped the British embassy or army in Afghanistan.

A tsunami of electric vehicles is expected in rich countries, as car companies and governments pledge to ramp up their numbers – there are predicted be 145m on the roads by 2030. But while electric vehicles can play an important role in reducing emissions, they also contain a potential environmental timebomb: their batteries.
By one estimate, more than 12m tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030.

Is it possible to appear muscular while making a phone call? It is certainly the look that furiously committed political man Dominic Raab seems to have gone for, in an official picture released by his department as he attempts to retcon acting like a foreign secretary while Kabul fell.
The photo of oneself on the phone was a favourite of George W Bush, though I can never remember seeing one of his that didn’t feel worthy of the caption: “Look Daddy! They let me use a phone!” Still, let’s have a look at Raab’s take on the genre. Grasping his chair with one hand and surrounded by flags, he is leaning so ferociously into the call that he can only have honed his game demanding to know why hotel housekeeping had failed to make his towel into a swan that morning. “I couldn’t give a toss that you were busy, and no, a turtle was not ‘fine’! You can’t just phone in any quarter-arsed terrycloth origami and claim to be offering a five-star guest experience. I think you should consider your position. [PAUSE] I’m so sorry, Secretary Blinken. I just reflexively dialled 1.”

                    <span>We are in an emergency. Wildfires are raging across the world as scorching temperatures and dry conditions fuel the blazes that have cost lives and destroyed livelihoods.
The combination of extreme heat, changes in our ecosystem and prolonged drought have in many regions led to the worst fires in almost a decade, and come after the IPCC handed down a damning landmark report on the climate crisis.
But technically, there are fewer wildfires than in the past – the problem now is that they are worse than ever and we are running out of time to act, as the Guardian&#x27;s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, explains

                    <span>The EU and its members have already adopted hardline policies that make an Afghan refugee crisis unlikely
As the fallout from Afghanistan continues, EU leaders are working themselves into a frenzy over the risk of a replay of the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis. At a news conference in Berlin on Monday, Armin Laschet, Angela Merkel’s likely successor, argued: “We should not send the signal that Germany can take in everyone in need. The focus must be on humanitarian aid on site, unlike in 2015.” Though the French president, Emmanuel Macron, recognised Europe’s duty to take in some of the “rights defenders, artists, journalists and campaigners who are now threatened”, it came with a major caveat. “Europe cannot face the consequences of the current situation on its own. We must anticipate and protect ourselves against sizeable flows of irregular migration,” he said in a press briefing.
Their concerns obscure the reality that the EU and its member states have spent years taking hardline measures to reduce irregular migration. This will prevent a rerun of 2015, when more than 1.2 million refugees sought asylum within the EU (0.16% of Europe’s total population), sparking political opposition based on the supposed threat that these people posed to the EU.

After wine and canapes on a patio overlooking high-rises and greenery in an affluent part of Lagos, 15 guests assemble inside. They sit facing one another across a long dining table, brightly lit by a steel row of low-hanging lights. Nigerian cultural masks and artworks adorn the walls of the restaurant, which evokes a Nigerian home.
The dishes emerge: traditional egusi soup, but with the efo (spinach) crisp amaranth leaves. Grains of gari, or cassava root, typically pounded to make a kind of dough called eba, is instead lightly dusted over it. Unusually, there are croutons. “An egusi crouton,” a guest nods approvingly.

In 2014, I returned to my place of birth in Melbourne, Australia, to visit family. The 32-hour slog to the other side of the globe was uncomfortable, but it was nothing compared with what awaited me on the ground.
One night, the uncle with whom I was staying went to Tasmania to visit friends. Suddenly, place transformed into a horror house. It was about 9pm, the sun was leaving the horizon and the lawn, which had been baked into straw, was getting a much-needed reprieve. Sweat had welded my polyester shirt so tightly to my back that it almost took my spine with it when I finally managed to peel it off.

When the broadcaster, author and journalist Sarfraz Manzoor started his career, he wrote mostly about the British Muslim experience. But doing this soon grew to feel reductive. Editors would shoehorn his Muslim identity into pieces that were not about religion, or ask him to comment on Pakistani politics as if he were an international relations scholar, rather than the son of working-class immigrants who settled in Luton in the 1970s.
“I felt like people like me were given a postage stamp sized space in which to operate,” says Manzoor. Which is why, after the publication of his 2007 memoir Greetings from Bury Park, subsequently adapted into the 2019 film Blinded By the Light, he moved on to other topics. He presented documentaries for Radio 4 on everything from Little Richard and test cricket to George Harrison.

“Good times are about to arrive,” Narendra Modi tweeted to his followers in May 2014. The result of the 16th general election to the Indian parliament had just been concluded. The National Democratic Alliance, led by his BJP party, had emerged victorious with a full majority, upstaging the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. The tweet announcing the arrival of acche din was more than a euphoric proclamation of this electoral victory. It hinted at his plans for a fast track to capitalist prosperity, the acceleration of the fabled “Indian growth story”, which would lead the country to a $5tn economy and consequently the high table of the world’s great powers. The promised future was now within reach, or so it seemed.

My wife, Marion, and I moved to Braintree in 2013 to be near our daughter and grandchildren, and I was struck by how friendly some of the locals were. Strangers would often wave as I passed them in the street. Some of them would also say, “Hello, John!” My name’s Neil, but I let it pass.
On one occasion we were in a cafe when a man came over and said, “You’re John Jemison, aren’t you?”

                    <span>British MPs have turned on Boris Johnson – but what tidy end did they expect from this imperialist experiment?
Britain’s MPs this week uttered one long howl of anguish over Afghanistan. Their immediate targets were Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, politicians who just happened to be on the watch when Kabul’s pack of cards collapsed. But their real concern was that a collective 20-year experiment in “exporting western values” to Afghanistan had fallen into chaos. MPs wanted someone other than themselves to blame. A politician is never so angry as when proved wrong.

Sophie Carrigill has played wheelchair basketball all over the world for Team GB. She’s been an Olympic torchbearer, won a string of medals and captained her country. But nothing means quite as much as the prospect of Paralympic gold.
In 2016, Carrigill and her team finished a brilliant – but agonising – fourth place at the Rio Games. Now she wants to get on the podium, but the sport she loves has already changed her life. She tells Nosheen Iqbal the remarkable story of her journey from a life-changing accident as a teenager to realising how talented she was, and now a chance of glory at what could be the peak of her career. And she reflects on how much the perception of disability sport has changed since she started out, and how far there still is to go.

Almost half the world’s 2.2 billion children are already at “extremely high risk” from the impacts of the climate crisis and pollution, according to a report from Unicef. The UN agency’s head called the situation “unimaginably dire”.
Nearly every child around the world was at risk from at least one of these impacts today, including heatwaves, floods, cyclones, disease, drought, and air pollution, the report said. But 1 billion children live in 33 countries facing three or four impacts simultaneously. The countries include India, Nigeria and the Philippines, and much of sub-Saharan Africa.

                    <span>Romelu Lukaku returns for Chelsea, Raphaël Varane set for United bow and Burnley test Virgil van Dijk’s aerial mettle
Arsenal beat Chelsea twice last season, including a victory at Stamford
Bridge three months ago. Since then they have spent heavily on transfers that include a £50m centre-back. Their fans must be super-confident as they prepare for Sunday’s Emirates clash, especially those who have blanked out last week’s fiasco at Brentford. But Thomas Tuchel is sure to bear that match in mind as he prepares his strategy for Sunday, and his pre-match pep talk is likely to begin with a good old-fashioned “get into ’em”. Ben White performed no worse than many teammates last week but the expectation on him is higher following his transfer, so he needs to earn back some trust by rising to Sunday’s challenge, which will be particularly formidable if a highly motivated and supremely confident Romelu Lukaku is given the first start in his second coming at Chelsea. Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, needs to pick a balanced lineup and find a way to inspire some oomph. There are only so many more humiliations Arsenal can suffer before the manager gets the heave-ho. PD

Investigators were searching for clues in the unexplained deaths of a California couple, their baby and the family dog in a remote area of the Sierra national forest.
John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their one-year-old daughter, Muji, and their dog were found dead on a hiking trail in Mariposa county. A family friend had reported them missing Monday evening.

Joe Biden has said that he and first lady Jill Biden plan on getting a booster shot and is comfortable doing so while millions around the world remain unvaccinated because America has “provided more to the rest of the world than all the rest of the world combined”.
He added that the US will also provide an additional half a billion shots around the world within the first half of next year. Critics argue this remains a drop in the ocean in the context of what is needed.

For nearly a year and a half after the onset of the pandemic, the Cook Islands didn’t see a single tourist.
In early 2020 the south Pacific country was forced to close its borders to keep Covid-19 out. In doing so it shut the doors on an industry that contributes two-thirds of the remote island country’s GDP.

On one of the worst mornings it was the arrest of 53 campaigners, politicians and activists, many of them Wong’s friends, for having the gall to hold a pre-election poll.

Dry and windy weather hampered efforts to contain destructive fires that are devouring the bone-dry forests of drought-stricken northern California, as a small wildfire swept through a mobile home park, leaving dozens of homes in ashes and injuring at least one person.

Captain Carlson scores 82 in Glamorgan’s victory

Kiran Carlson looks like Joaquin Phoenix might if he ever took on happy roles. And maybe, if Hollywood ever decides to make a sports movie about Glamorgan’s Royal London One-Day Cup win, Phoenix will finally have one.
Don’t tell the Glamorgan captain that this competition doesn’t mean much any more. You could see how much it meant as he tracked the ball, flying from Liam Trevaskis’s bat into the hands of Nick Selman. Carlson was right next to him as the catch landed, and right on top of him a second later; the score was 238 for nine, and Carlson could finally be sure that Durham’s hopes were extinguished.

In short, this was a performance Rob Burrow would have been incredibly proud of. Burrow was renowned for many things as a player but whether it was then, during his glittering on-field career, or now, as he takes on his biggest fight of all with Motor Neurone Disease, you have always been guaranteed fight and spirit from the 38-year-old.
How the club he holds so close to his heart channelled those traits here to keep their hopes of a ninth Super League title alive. On the night Burrow was present as Leeds’ guest of honour, you felt everyone in attendance were steeled for an emotional evening. But as the words began to stream from the app which now helps Burrow communicate, it was impossible not to be moved.

Harry Kane not involved as Spurs labour to first-leg loss

If Tottenham really want to reach the Europa Conference League group stage, it might be time to call upon a top-class centre-forward. Paços de Ferreira deserved this win over a scratch selection, a first-half goal from Lucas Silva ensuring there was at least something to remember of a thoroughly tedious match. Even so, the Portuguese side were certainly not good enough to suggest a fully firing Harry Kane would have problems putting them away if picked for next week’s second leg; continued participation in this competition might be bittersweet as parting shots go, though, and there was certainly little indication in a featureless showing that Nuno Espírito Santo would lose sleep over an early exit.

A rescue helicopter carrying the survivor – a 30-year-old woman who appeared exhausted and shaken – landed at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria airport on Tuesday, after a cargo ship found her 135 miles off the coast.

Joan Smith, who has campaigned and written extensively on the subject of sexual violence, including columns for the Guardian, has said she was removed from her position as co-chair of the violence against women and girls (VAWG) board by email. She had held the unpaid independent scrutiny role at City Hall since 2013, having been appointed by the then mayor, Boris Johnson, and continued under Sadiq Khan.

                    <span>Witness describes mass panic during independence day rally in Asadabad, and in Kabul chaos continues at airport
Several people have been killed after Taliban fighters shot at crowds waving the national flag at an independence day rally, as protests erupted across Afghanistan in a sign of the dissent the Taliban may face as they attempt to govern.
At Kabul airport, chaos continued, preventing dozens of those eligible for evacuation by Britain from being able to reach the rescue aircraft. The Taliban maintained a heavy presence on the airport’s approaches and, in desperate scenes, babies were passed to US soldiers in the hope of giving them a life outside the country.

Dominic Raab is facing increasing pressure to resign, including from some of his own party’s MPs, after claims he effectively disappeared for more than a week while on holiday during the collapse of Afghanistan, delegating almost all duties to juniors.
Raab’s department did not deny he asked another minister to make a call on Friday to assist the evacuation of former British military translators while he was in Crete. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and SNP demanded Boris Johnson sack his foreign secretary if he did not decide to quit.

                    <span>Cheap money, the Delta variant and China’s sluggish performance add up to tough times ahead
Financial markets these days react to any whiff of tighter monetary policy in the US, so a little drama on Thursday was par for the course after the US Federal Reserve’s minutes suggested the winding-down of the huge pandemic stimulus programme could start soon. The Fed will still be buying assets in the autumn, but maybe not at the rate of $120bn (£89bn) a month. Commodities fell and shares globally took a hit. The FTSE 100 index dropped 1.5%.
Context is needed, of course. The Footsie had risen by 25% in a straight line, more or less, since the arrival of vaccines last November. If one goes back further to the start of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500, the main US index, has roughly doubled from its low point. So the odd percentage decline hardly shows up on a medium-term view.

Most of the 125-strong team of security personnel, employed by the global security firm GardaWorld, have been given informal notice that they no longer have jobs guarding the embassy, several said.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is facing calls to urge MPs to wear masks in the chamber, after cabinet ministers and many Tory backbenchers shunned the advice during a packed eight-hour debate on Afghanistan.
Although face coverings stopped being mandatory in most settings on 19 July, government guidance that face coverings should be work in “crowded and enclosed spaces” remains in place, and rules set down by the parliamentary authorities say they should be worn in the main debating space.

US officials thought their British counterparts “were out of their minds” in aiming for herd immunity as part of Boris Johnson’s initial policy on dealing with the coronavirus, according to a new book about the global response to the pandemic.
As the scale of the threat became increasingly clear in January and February 2020, officials in Donald Trump’s administration were trying to convince him to take the threat seriously, despite personal reassurances he had been given by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that it was under control.

With the Taliban now firmly in control of most of Afghanistan, British government figures have been wrestling with what that means for everything from counter-terrorism to the drugs trade and aid.
How soon should Britain’s battlefield foes be recognised as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan? What attitude should the UK take to the burgeoning resistance coalescing around former Afghan government figures as the threat of renewed civil war looms?

                    <span>After years of cuts, the pandemic has left social services and the young people they support brutally exposed 
About the only good thing that can be said about the worsening crisis in children’s social care is that it is being talked about. The extremely serious consequences of the pandemic for some of the most vulnerable children in the UK were predictable. To an extent, these risks were taken on board by policymakers, for example when they decreed that schools would remain open for those deemed to be in need of support.
But a year and a half into the pandemic, it is clear that children who rely on local authorities for some aspects of their care, if not all of it, have been left horribly exposed. Guardian reporting has uncovered huge increases in referrals to social services, children being taken into care, and notifications related to domestic abuse and exploitation. In Middlesbrough, for example, referrals rose 40%, while the former children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is so worried about grooming by criminal gangs that she is launching an independent inquiry.

                    <span>The UK should never have joined the US invasion, writes Dr Taj Hargey, and its reputation is being stained by America’s unilateral retreat. Plus letters from Jonathan Worthington and Sandra Khadhouri
In Wednesday’s revelatory parliamentary debates there was hardly any mention of the opportunist architects of the failed British involvement in Afghanistan (Tories rebuke Boris Johnson over ‘catastrophic’ Afghanistan failure, 18 August). Tony Blair and his new Labour clique blindly followed a retributive George Bush in invading and occupying Afghanistan. The ultimate blame for the UK’s futile 20-year presence there must be levelled at the slavishly pro-American New Labour party. Why did Blair, Jack Straw, Peter Mandelson and other complicit Labour figures buy in to the US plans that the only solution was to remove Osama bin Laden by full-scale military force? Was this overreach necessary to crush a tiny non-state actor? 
By tying itself to the apron strings of the US, Britain’s reputation has been stained by America’s unilateral retreat from Afghanistan. Had Blair taken a leaf out of Harold Wilson’s book – who famously refused Lyndon Johnson’s entreaties to join the US war in Vietnam – the UK would not now be in such an invidious position. When will Britain learn that its national interests are not always identical to, or in symmetry with, hegemonic America? At least some brave parliamentarians now share this view.

                    <span>The Law and Justice party’s authoritarian grip on the country’s politics has been weakened
At a glance, it has been business as usual this summer for Poland’s conservative-nationalist government. There has been a fierce row over attempts to introduce a disciplinary system to keep judges in line. A controversial new bill threatens to further compromise media independence, by banning non-European ownership of broadcasting companies. Both the European Union and the United States have railed at these latest anti-democratic manoeuvres, designed to strengthen the authoritarian grip of the Law and Justice party (PiS). But, despite all the international criticism, PiS remains ahead of its rivals in the polls.
So far, so familiar. But six years after PiS won power, turning Poland into a bastion of European illiberalism alongside Hungary, the party’s polarising playbook is not working the political magic it once did. This week Warsaw backed down on the judges dispute, which was in danger of becoming a tipping point in its vexed relations with the EU. Under pressure from Brussels, it has disbanded the supreme court chamber – packed with political appointees – to which court verdicts would have been answerable. Having gone to the brink, Poland blinked first.

Labour has accused the government of failing to prepare struggling low-income families for October’s £20-a-week cut in universal credit payments after it emerged that up to 2 million claimants were unaware of the imminent reduction.
Separate surveys carried out by poverty charities indicate that between 18% and 36% of claimants did not know their income will fall by £90 a week or £1,050 a year after September – the biggest cut to social security payments since the second world war.

Less seems to be more for Nelly Korda. Eyebrows were raised when the world No 1 opted to avoid pre-tournament media duties at the Women’s Open, with whispers abounding at Carnoustie as to why the recently crowned Olympic champion may opt to shun the limelight. The explanation for reticence, it transpired, was perfectly straightforward.
“I’ve had a long couple of weeks,” Korda said. “It was the day of my pro-am and I was just really tired. I wasn’t really hitting it well and just went to the range to try to prepare for the next four days. Sometimes you’ve got to give your body a break.” Pressure, what pressure? “It doesn’t matter what my ranking is,” Korda said. “Everyone’s going into this event prepared and wanting to win.

                    <span>Mike Lucraft responds to an article about Adam Crozier, who was in charge of Royal Mail when subpostmasters were accused of theft because of a faulty IT system
So, Adam Crozier, the new chair of BT, “spent two decades steering businesses out of corporate crisis” (Can Adam Crozier help connect BT to a bright future?, 17 August)? Really? From 2003 until 2010, when he was chief executive of Royal Mail (which then owned the Post Office), he oversaw the hounding of subpostmasters who were accused of theft and fraud because of the seriously flawed Fujitsu Horizon IT system that they were obliged to use. Under his watch, people were bankrupted and ostracised as prosecutions were pursued against them.
This scandal has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in English legal history (UK government sets aside up to £233m to cover Post Office payouts, 25 July). Only in the past year or so has there been any correction of the shocking wrong done to those subpostmasters. Nobody in charge at the Post Office or Fujitsu has ever been brought to book. And as for compensation, will it be the Post Office or Fujitsu or any of those who were in charge paying? No. It will be the taxpayer. So, Adam Crozier did not steer the Post Office out of any corporate crisis. He steered it headlong into one.

Jerhonda Pace resumed her testimony in Brooklyn federal court a day after telling jurors she was a 16-year-old virgin and a member of Kelly’s fan club when he invited her to his mansion in 2009.

At 10.5 metres wide, four centuries old and twice the size of its nearest cousin, an “exceptionally large” coral has been discovered on the Great Barrier Reef – the widest known in the area.
The coral is 5.3 metres tall, “hemispherical in shape” and 2.4 metres wider than the next widest specimen. It is roughly the length and height of a modern double-decker bus.

Geronimo, the condemned alpaca, has been granted another 24-hour reprieve, with its owner claiming the UK government hopes she will carry out its “dirty work” and put her beloved animal down herself.
“They don’t want blood on their hands,” said Helen Macdonald, a veterinary nurse. “They’re trying to wear me down and get me to euthanise a perfectly healthy animal. I’m not going to do that. Simple as that.”

The City of London will be the target of a new round of Extinction Rebellion protests aimed at highlighting the role of high finance in the climate crisis, starting next week and carrying on for at least a fortnight.
Thousands of protesters are expected to take part in a series of actions in the City, details of which are under wraps. These will target businesses headquartered in the Square Mile financial district, and will include site occupations. There are no plans to disrupt public transport, as has occurred during some previous actions.

The average custodial sentence length for violent crimes fell by 22% to 18.5 months and the figure for sexual offences fell by 12% to 52 months, the lowest figure since 2011, according to official figures.

                    <span>On dating shows and beyond, coupling up seems to be the key to success. But for every smitten pairing, there’s another capitalising on the popularity of the ‘showmance’ 
It is well known that sex sells, but, on reality TV, love sells even more. Nowhere is this better illustrated than on ITV2’s Love Island. Despite complaints about this season being bland, as well as concerns about the contestants’ conduct (Faye Winters’ tirade towards Teddy Soares broke the show’s record for Ofcom’s complaints, racking up nearly 25,000), it has attracted the biggest digital audience of any show this year.
As we prepare for its culmination next week, a slate of other dating shows are already vying for its place. For instance, Ready to Mingle, which starts on ITV2 next month. In the series, a woman searches for her perfect partner among 12 male suitors, but not all of the boys are single. I smell a smash hit.

Campaigners for clinically extremely vulnerable people have called for urgent government action to ensure they receive Covid booster vaccinations as soon as possible, after members of the government’s vaccines watchdog cast doubt on plans for them to begin early next month.
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises ministers, met on Thursday morning and some members believe that significantly more work is needed before booster jabs can be rolled out.

Sonny Chiba, the Japanese martial arts movie star who found late-career renown in Hollywood after outspoken admiration from Quentin Tarantino, has died aged 82 from a Covid-related illness. Variety reported that it had received confirmation of the news from Chiba’s agent.
With an acting career beginning in the 1960s with a string of roles in Japanese martial arts films and TV shows, Chiba became widely known in the west after being name-checked in True Romance, the 1993 thriller written by Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. By then, Chiba had become a star in Japan, appearing in titles such as the 1970s Street Fighter trilogy (and its spin-off, Sister Street Fighter), Bullet Train and Champion of Death.

Choruses of “Chelsea rent boy” could be heard from the away section with Liverpool quick to condemn the chants after the game, labelling them “offensive and inappropriate”.

Didier Raoult has built a worldwide following throughout the pandemic for his support of the malaria drug despite its failure in randomised control trials. Multiple studies, including by the Recovery trial and the World Health Organisation, have found hydroxychloroquine to be ineffective in treating Covid-19.

If historians of the future wish to understand the ignorance and hubris that accompanied the decline of the west’s power, this week’s emergency parliamentary debate on Afghanistan will provide an insightful case study. The delusions that have long characterised British foreign policy remained intact when Iraq was destroyed for the sake of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction; when British soldiers were forced into a humiliating retreat from Iraq’s southern city of Basra at the hands of Iranian-backed Shia militias; and when Libya was left as a failed state. It seemed unlikely that the Taliban casually waltzing into Kabul would finally break the spell.
Take the much celebrated contribution from Theresa May, who asked, “Where is global Britain on the streets of Kabul?” and rued the repercussions of Britain depending “on a unilateral decision taken by the United States”. The former prime minister is a fantasist: Britain has not had a foreign policy independent of the United States since the 1950s, and indefinite occupation of Afghanistan, which has been proposed as an alternative to withdrawal, effectively means transforming the country into a colony.

                    <span>In a message from his prison cell, the jailed Russian opposition activist calls for the west to take sanctions against oligarchs
Exactly one year ago, I did not die from poisoning by a chemical weapon, and it would seem that corruption played no small part in my survival. Having contaminated Russia’s state system, corruption has also contaminated the intelligence services. When a country’s senior management is preoccupied with protection rackets and extortion from businesses, the quality of covert operations inevitably suffers. A group of FSB agents applied the nerve agent to my underwear just as shoddily as they incompetently dogged my footsteps for three and a half years – in violation of all instructions from above – allowing civil investigating activists to expose them at every turn.
To be fair, a regime based on corruption can perform more elementary tasks to perfection. The judicial system – the first thing autocrats intent on robbing their nation take control of – functions perfectly on a quid pro quo basis. That is why, when I went back to Russia after medical treatment, I was taken straight from the plane to prison. There is not much to celebrate in that, but at least I now have time to read the memoirs of world leaders.

                    <span>Ayten Amin’s Souad is a razor-sharp portrayal of sisterhood and sexual awakening that is rarely represented on screen
When the Egyptian director Ayten Amin was 10 years old, a classmate’s sister killed herself. The news gripped the school. But, in a society where suicide is a sin, no one talked about it; instead, they mourned the girl as though she had died mysteriously, or in an accident. “When I was shooting my first film, it suddenly hit me,” Amin says over a video call from her home in Cairo. “How did my classmate feel back then? How did she grow up knowing what happened, but with no one talking about it?”
In her new film, Souad, Amin explores precisely this: the hidden lives of teenage girls in Egypt. It follows the title character (played by Bassant Ahmed) and Rabab (Basmala Elghaiesh), sisters of 19 and 13 living in Zagazig, a small city 40 miles north of Cairo in the Nile delta. To her family and friends, Souad is as religious as she is studious – but she lives a different life online. She has virtual relationships with men and becomes enthralled by the glamorous-seeming Ahmed (Hussein Ghanem), an influencer from the fashionable Mediterranean city of Alexandria. Their relationship begins to sour when Souad stands up Ahmed for a real-life date; it gets steadily worse as a cycle of sexts and arguments sets in. Then tragedy strikes.

The coroner overseeing the case of the Plymouth gunman, Jake Davison, who killed his mother and four other people, has asked a watchdog to examine whether changes to weapons licensing have been made since a man shot dead three women in the north of England almost 10 years ago.
At the opening of inquests into the deaths of Jake Davison and his five victims, it emerged that the 22-year-old apprentice crane driver shot his mother in the head and torso after an argument. He went on to kill four people he did not know, including a three-year-old girl, in nearby streets and a park. He then shot himself in the head, the court was told.

Shibe’s playing  buzzes with vitality in this revelatory new recording
You might think you know what Spanish guitar music sounds like, and you might think it an unexpectedly middle-of-the-road choice for Sean Shibe, who has always appeared more at home in programmes that set your ears slightly off-kilter: for example, juxtaposing whispering lute music with screaming electric guitar works by Julia Wolfe, as on his 2018 album softLOUD. But there’s nothing hackneyed about Camino. It’s a beautifully intimate recording, full of playing that is as far from classical-guitar cliche as a real flamenco dancer is from a postcard of a donkey in a sombrero.

It doesn’t look like the site of a groundbreaking historical project, but the small holes in a carefully excavated site behind where the goal once was tell a different story.

“The bullfighting festival is over,” the city’s Socialist mayor, Ana González, told reporters. “They have crossed various lines … A city that believes in equality between men and women, that believes in integration, that believes in open doors for everyone cannot allow these sorts of things to happen.”

In March last year, it was predicted that the global travel shutdown would cause international arrivals to plummet by 20 to 30% by the end of 2020.
Six weeks later, the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) revised their warning: international arrivals could fall by up to 80% – equating to a billion fewer tourists and the worst crisis in the history of the industry.

Music was like a totem pole for us, growing up in Belfast in the 70s. My mother was a singer and a dancer: she had a beautiful voice, and if there was ever a chance to get on the dancefloor, she’d take it. She loved Motown, but especially Ray Charles. I still love a ballad with a driving beat. And I still love to dance. My dad didn’t dance, so my mother was always dragging me on to the dancefloor with her when Ray Charles came on. I got used, at a young age, to clearing the dancefloor with my mother; putting on a show together. That was our bond. People would stand around clapping while we danced. That was my first public performance.

In late November 2007, Carl Cox’s DJing career was over – or so he thought. A few days earlier he had played a set at a festival in Caracas, Venezuela, as part of a tour of South America. The vibe was good and the crowd was bouncing. “I heard all these fireworks go: ‘Bang, bang, bang.’ Everyone was going: ‘Woooo! Yeeaaaah!’” Cox mimics dancing behind the decks. “Then there were more bangs and I thought: ‘Yay, more fireworks!’ But then I looked at the crowd and something was wrong. They were dispersing. I realised: ‘Fuck, that’s not fireworks, that’s gunfire.’”
Two rival gang members had met on the dancefloor and begun shooting. Cox got down on the floor and crawled to a backstage locker room where he and his tour manager barricaded themselves in. After an hour, they were escorted out to a car, past scores of police vans and ambulances. Four people had died and nine were injured. “Seeing people shot on the dancefloor and dying in front of me, blood everywhere …” Cox says, rubbing his eyes. “One minute we were having the time of our lives and the next we were cowering for our lives.”

In August 2018, the then 15-year-old Greta Thunberg started spending her school days outside the Swedish parliament calling for stronger action on climate change. It might sound perverse, a teacher supporting kids taking time off school, but spreading awareness of environmental issues is something I’ve always been passionate about. The challenge is finding a way to give them a meaningful climate education in the classroom.
As a middle school (aged nine to 13) science teacher, I’ve seen pupils react to the climate crisis in a number of ways. I still hear “my dad says it’s not real” every once in a while, but mostly they are interested. Interested in how oil companies obfuscated the truth, interested in the science, and interested in what the future holds now that we’re “running out of time”.

Fawzia Koofi, an Afghan politician and women’s rights activist, said the chaotic withdrawal undermined all leverage that the US and the Afghan government had had with the Taliban at the talks in Qatar.

                    <span>Hundreds of people on the runway, women and children screaming, and gunshots lighting up the sky: Afghan journalist Ramin Rahman spoke to the Guardian about his chaotic escape from Hamid Karzai international airport the day the Taliban took Kabul.
Rahman, 27, left Kabul fearing for his life. As &#x27;a progressive, outspoken journalist with tattoos&#x27; – he is basically the antithesis of what the Taliban stand for.
He described several hours of uncertainty and panic, running with hundreds of others towards US aircraft, and the agonising wait before the plane took off from Afghanistan

When Fred Schoeps bought a 150-year-old building in downtown Ithaca, New York, a decade ago, he was one of only a handful of building owners dedicated to ending their reliance on fossil fuels and reducing their carbon footprint.
His three-year renovation of the building, comprising three apartments above a skate store, included installing energy-efficient windows and insulation, plus fully electric appliances, heating and cooling systems.

Equipped with lovely melodies and a bombast-resistant sound, the New Zealander exchanges the spotlight for a sly reflection on true happiness
Plenty of mainstream pop stars have decided they no longer want to be mainstream pop stars. They’ve tried everything to achieve their goal, from making deliberately unlistenable albums, to – in the memorable case of the late Scott Walker – locking themselves in a monastery on the Isle of Wight.
But few have attempted to bid farewell to mainstream pop stardom as prettily as Lorde does on her third album. It opens with a guitar picking a gentle, woozy-sounding figure. A flute glides beatifically by and Lorde offers a grim depiction of life as a teenager superstar – complete with “nightmares from the camera flash” – before apparently saying goodbye to all that: “alone on a windswept island”, she “won’t take the call if it’s the label or radio”. “If you’re looking for a saviour,” she adds, “that’s not me”, which would sound a little self-aggrandising had the world of online fandom not become so overheated that whenever a female pop star posts anything on social media, the responses are clogged up by stans calling them “mum”, “queen” and “goddess”.

                    <span>She dated Elvis – then made him look tame with her growling, high-energy rock’n’roll. And at 83 years old, she still can’t quite embrace retirement
In 2019, Wanda Jackson announced her retirement from performing. She had been on the road for 65 years, during which time she had variously been a country star, a rock’n’roll pioneer, a gospel singer and a grande dame hailed as either the Queen of Rockabilly, or its First Lady. It was a career that had taken her from touring with Elvis Presley just as his career took off to collaborating with Jack White, but she was ready to stop travelling: she had suffered a stroke, “problems with my knees and such”, and Wendell Goodman, her husband and manager of 55 years, had died in 2017. She was, she says, “glad of the rest”.
And yet, here we are, two and a half years on. Jackson is peering out of my laptop screen from her home in Oklahoma: 83, sharp as a tack, fully madeup, elaborately coiffured and brushing aside queries about what happened to her retirement with a chuckle of “it’s hard to get a good girl down”.

                    <span>Establishing humanitarian corridors and monitoring human rights is crucial – and achievable – as the Taliban take control

Mark Malloch-Brown is a former UN deputy secretary general

I have seen this tragedy before. As a young UN planner in the late 1980s, I helped design the relief operation after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. More than a decade later, as head of the UN Development Programme, I led early relief and reconstruction efforts after the fall of the Taliban. In both cases, the fragile peace that followed conflicts was undermined by key actors in the international community, who stood back or actively opposed when their assistance was needed. The US armed the opposition to the government the Soviets left behind; and when a US-backed government then took power after 9/11, it faced opposition from America’s Asian rivals.

                    <span>If I exert control during sex, I don’t enjoy it. I prefer to lie back – but how do I square this with my beliefs?
I have been with my partner for almost six years and, for the most part, have enjoyed our sex. I prefer to ‘sit back and relax’ and my partner is OK with that. If I get on top or have too much control, I am unable to get out of my head and I feel stressed. However, my personality and moral side finds this conflicting, as outside the bedroom I am a feminist and agree that women have for too long been taught to submit to their man and forget their own needs. This has caused confusion in my understanding of the way I enjoy sex. How can I feel as if I am in control without being dominant in the bedroom? Can I be a feminist while being submissive during sex?
Consensual sex requires that both partners give permission for what occurs, whether they take on a more passive or a dominant role at any given moment. If someone chooses to assume a submissive erotic position, that is an agreement that he or she could withdraw at any time. So, in fact, the submissive partner is actually the moral controller; if that person wishes to gain physical dominance, he or she must first be sure that permission for that is fully granted by the partner. But while these facts may help you to consider physical submission more ethically palatable, in general, erotic connections are heightened when taboos are broken … including what might be considered a feminist no-no.

For more than a decade, Ahmad Sarmast has taken impoverished children from the streets of Afghanistan and filled their lives with music. One, an orphan girl who hawked chewing gum in one of the most conservative areas of the country, became a conductor of Afghanistan’s first all-female orchestra.
All that is now at risk as the Taliban tighten their grip on power.

My youngest son is almost four, so the sleep-deprived agony of newborn parenting has fully receded. My sleep is no longer jittery and surface-level, primed to be wrecked by the tiniest disturbance. When I sleep now, I expect to sleep.
Then last month, like a dummy, I took my kids camping. True, I did everything to maximise the amount of sleep I’d get. I booked a slightly upmarket campsite, complete with actual beds, and did some sums. The sun went down late and came up early, so my sons would wake up at the crack of dawn. But if I drifted off when they did, and everything worked out perfectly, I could just about cram in six hours.

The shocking assault was captured on several videos, which went viral and showed a mob descend on the woman as she was in Lahore’s Greater Iqbal park making a TikTok video with friends. In broad daylight, the men picked up the young woman and tossed her between them, tearing her clothes and assaulting and groping her.

When the government first drew up plans to axe the virtual parliament and bring MPs back to the Commons chamber, ministers argued that it would boost support for the prime minister. Boris Johnson tends to work best with a crowd, so events such as prime minister’s questions were trickier when only a handful of Tory MPs were allowed in the chamber.
But when Conservative politicians turned up en masse to the Commons on Wednesday to debate the situation in Afghanistan, the opposite proved true. Rather than provide supportive interventions, Johnson soon discovered his biggest critics were sitting right behind him.

                    <span>Australian psychologist Steven Taylor published what would turn out to be a prophetic book, and it has become like a Lonely Planet guide to the pandemic
In October 2019, a month or so before Covid-19 began to spread from the industrial Chinese city of Wuhan, Steven Taylor, an Australian psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, published what would turn out to be a remarkably prophetic book, The Psychology of Pandemics.
Even his publishers had doubts about its relevance and market potential. But in the 22 months since, the book has become like a Lonely Planet guide to the pandemic, passed around and marked up like waypoints along a new and dreadful global health journey.

                    <span>Mountains offer great landscapes, hiking and places to stay, as these ideas from a new Wild Guide to the French Alps show
While the pristine turquoise waters of Lac d’Annecy are renowned, the remote massif of Les Bauges, which rises to its west and south, is one of the least-visited areas of the French Alps. Fringed on almost all sides by great forested limestone ridges and escarpments, the interior of the Bauges feels a place apart in time as well as in geography. As it’s a protected parc naturel regional, ski development here is limited mostly to the cross-country variety. In summer this verdant oasis of green, cut by deep gorges and ravines, is a nature lover’s dream.

On 11 March 2021, I took a selfie at the Baltimore Convention Center and pressed send. I’d just received my first dose of a Covid vaccine. “Feels pretty momentous,” I texted an acquaintance. “It was exactly one year ago that our university shut down.” Frank wrote back immediately from his small town in southern Michigan. “Momentous, yes. But not for the reasons you subscribe to,” he wrote.

                    <span>Mohammed El Halabi is accused of stealing relief money and giving it to Hamas for their war effort against Israel. But five years on, the evidence against him looks seriously flawed
At about 9am on 12 July 2016, dozens of Israeli security officers stormed through the gates of the Augusta Victoria hospital complex in East Jerusalem. They surged past the hospital, which mostly serves the local Palestinian population, and through the main car park to a three-storey building where the offices of the international charity World Vision were located.
The officers, some armed with rifles, ordered the charity’s few dozen staff into a meeting room and seized their phones to prevent them contacting the outside world. According to witnesses, they were kept there for the next four hours. Occasionally, Israeli police and intelligence agents called an employee out of the room for questioning, while others roamed the offices, searching through files.

The ozone-wrecking chemicals once commonly used in refrigerators would have driven 2.5C of extra global heating by the end of the century if they had not been banned, research has found.
Modelling by climate scientists found that the 1987 Montreal protocol curbing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gave humans a fighting chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out by the Paris agreement.

                    <span>The man who killed five people in south-west England last week was part of a hateful online community of men who blame women for their status as ‘involuntary celibates’. Did that contribute to his violence – and does the incel movement radicalise some of the young men who are part of it?
Last Thursday night, a 22-year-old man killed five people, including his mother and a three-year-old girl, in Plymouth. It was the worst mass shooting in Britain in more than a decade.

Police initially described the murders as a “domestic” incident. But as more evidence emerged about the killer, who also took his own life, we learned that he had been immersed in a misogynist online world known as the “incel” movement – and now police are seriously considering the possibility that his actions were motivated by a hatred of women.

A record number of children and young people with a potentially life-threatening eating disorder are waiting for treatment in England, as psychiatrists warn soaring demand is overwhelming services.
NHS data analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists shows that while the number of those waiting for urgent and routine treatment has reached record levels during the pandemic, more children and young people are being treated than ever before.

The country has been in turmoil since 1 February, when the armed forces seized power in a lightning coup, triggering dissent as protesters demanded a return to democracy.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Fully vaccinated adults can harbour virus levels as high as unvaccinated people if infected with the Delta variant, according to a sweeping analysis of UK data, which supports the idea that hitting the threshold for herd immunity is unlikely.
There is abundant evidence that Covid vaccines in the UK continue to offer significant protection against hospitalisations and death. But this new analysis shows that although being fully vaccinated means the risk of getting infected is lower, once infected by Delta a person can carry similar virus levels as unvaccinated people.

                    <span>Change in papal law in 1336 to allow twice-weekly consumption caused problems at Muchelney Abbey
It may have seemed a good day for medieval monks when a papal decree allowed them to start eating meat including mutton, beef, pork and venison. It was not so good for their bowels.
Research by English Heritage sheds light on the day-to-day lives and digestive troubles of monks at Muchelney Abbey in Somerset – in particular the consequence of a change in papal law, in 1336, which permitted the twice-weekly consumption of meat from four-legged animals.

                    <span>Gillian Lynne theatre, London
Bewitching melodies abound as Andrew Lloyd Webber’s terrifically OTT but warm and inclusive musical finally arrives
Delayed by a year because of the pandemic, and with last month’s opening night postponed at the 11th hour, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical is finally up and running. It arrives late but in high fashion with outre gowns, bare-chested swordplay, brutal high heels and whip-smart humour. It’s worth the wait.
The original story and book by Emerald Fennell have heart and a torrent of barbed wit, exposing the faulty morals in traditional fairytales without scrimping on glittering trimmings. David Zippel’s crystalline lyrics are attuned to Fennell’s dialogue, cheekily satirical yet wistful and uplifting too. Lord Lloyd-Webber’s richly enjoyable orchestrations range from grand waltzes, courtly processionals and marches to deftly pastiched and deeply felt romanticism, power-balladry, a splash of chanson and rollicking guitar riffs. Bewitching melodies abound: some refrains are practically iridescent, revealing new tones from scene to scene.

Fate of two Canadians held in China seen as linked

After two and a half years of legal wrangling, an extradition hearing over Meng Wanzhou has wrapped up, leaving the fate of Huawei’s chief financial officer – and potentially that of two detained Canadians caught up in a geopolitical tussle – in the hands of a British Columbia judge.
The arrest and legal saga of the telecoms executive has become a source of immense tension between the economic superpowers China and the United States, but it has been Canada – and two of its citizens – that have suffered the steepest collateral damage.

Arsenal are closing on a £30m deal to sign the Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The 23-year-old, who was part of Gareth Southgate’s England squad at Euro 2020, is expected to provide competition for Bernd Leno and was Mikel Arteta’s first-choice goalkeeping target this summer.
The proposed deal is for Ramsdale worth an initial £24m, plus £6m in performance-related add-ons. Arteta is understood to be keen on adding a contingent of young players with personality to develop on his watch. Arsenal have already signed the defender Ben White for £50m from Brighton, while a move for the Norway midfielder Martin Ødegaard is also thought to be progressing.

In the past year, Osaka has pulled out of the French Open and Wimbledon before she returned to her native Japan to light the flame at the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony, then lost in the third round of the women’s singles competition.

I remember the time Linda Barker put up shelves to house a woman’s beloved teapot collection and they collapsed overnight, shattering every piece of china and the woman’s heart into a thousand pieces. I remember Anna Ryder Richardson framing unmistakeably French underwear to decorate the walls of a revamped room and the owner shouting, “Why would I want this shit in my room! I’ve got children!”
However. Those few minutes represent the full yield of genuine entertainment provided by 17 series of the makeover show Changing Rooms, which dominated the airwaves (a concept I’ll have to explain later, O infant roamers of the fragmented contemporary TV landscape) from 1996 to 2004. It was presented by Carol Smillie, who was tall and beautiful and owned all of Scotland’s teeth. Two sets of friends are allowed to redecorate a room in the other’s house with the help of designers such as the aforementioned Barker, Ryder Richardson and – above all – Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, along with “Handy Andy”, who led the carpenters, painters etc who did the actual work required to transfer the pure stupidity in their heads into three-dimensional stupidity that could be spray-painted and used to sit/sleep/cry on.

It emerged on Wednesday that there were no immediate plans to publish the report, which was delivered to executives at Headingley last Saturday, prompting Rafiq to claim the club was “trying to bury it” and appeal to the governing body for assistance. The call was answered within hours as the ECB demanded that Yorkshire deliver a timeline for publication and praised the player’s “considerable courage”.

Britain fears US forces may pull out of Kabul international airport within days, putting it at risk of closure and raising concerns over the emergency airlift of thousands of people from Afghanistan.
Whitehall and security sources said they could not guarantee how long the US would keep its contingent of 6,000 troops on the ground and cautioned that the UK could not continue the rescue without their presence. They also indicated Britain was not engaging with the Taliban directly over security or other issues after the militant group seized the Afghan capital.

The takeover of the British defence firm Ultra Electronics by a US private equity company will be investigated on national security grounds, after the business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, told the competition regulator to examine the deal.
Warning that foreign investment “must not threaten national security”, Kwarteng tabled an order in parliament preventing Ultra from disclosing “sensitive information” to Cobham, the defence firm behind the £2.6bn takeover bid. He said Ultra would be prevented from passing on details of the “goods or services it provides to HM Government or HM Armed Forces”, while the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) examined the deal.

American tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI) has snapped up a 22.6% stake in Vectura as it closes in on a controversial £1.1bn takeover.
The cigarette maker has hired investment banking giant BofA Securities to offer 165p a share to any shareholders outside the US willing to sell their Vectura shares.

Few homes were left standing in Grizzly Flats, California, the small northern California forest town leveled by the Caldor fire on Tuesday.
Streets in the town of about 1,200 people were littered with downed power lines and poles. Houses were reduced to smoldering ash and twisted metal with only chimneys rising above the ruins. A post office and elementary school were also destroyed. Two people were in the hospital with serious injuries.

The World Health Organization has condemned the rush by wealthy countries to provide Covid-19 vaccine booster shots while millions of people around the world have yet to receive a single dose.
Speaking before US authorities announced all vaccinated Americans would soon be eligible to receive booster doses, WHO experts insisted there was not enough scientific evidence to support the additional shot.

The prime minister told parliament on Wednesday that Britain was prepared for the fall of Kabul and also that it could not have been foreseen. Those two things cannot be true simultaneously. Both were false. The pace of events after US forces were withdrawn might have caught western governments by surprise, but the withdrawal itself has been on the international timetable since February 2020.
That it was agreed by Donald Trump is not an excuse for his successor’s misjudgements. But nor are Joe Biden’s actions a justification for Boris Johnson’s complacency in failing to plan a response. As recently as July, the prime minister asserted that the Taliban had no military route to victory.

                    <span>Tearing down old structures and throwing up new ones is how we usually make our streetscapes. It’s also ruinous for the climate
A new and highly swanky hotel lands in Edinburgh, a mass of shimmering bronze-coloured coils, and all anyone can think to say is: doesn’t that look like a giant poo emoji? Londoners are confronted with plans for a giant burning-red orb, which will supposedly serve as a concert venue, and it brings on the shudders.
New buildings can amuse or repulse us, induce awe or yawns, but there is a case for thinking of them less as objects to walk around and more as processes to worry about – because the process of building is one of the most wasteful and carbon-hungry engaged in by humanity. We tear down old houses or shops, and to create new ones, we cover the Earth with materials that have gobbled up fossil fuels: Concrete, of which the world pours enough each year to patio over every park and mountain and back garden, every square inch, in England; steel, of which every tonne produced emits nearly two tonnes of carbon dioxide; plastics. While Conservative MPs argue over who is going to foot the bill for green energy for our homes, hardly anyone in Westminster discusses the upfront carbon costs of building houses and office blocks and shopping malls. Yet construction directly accounts for about 10% of our carbon emissions. Turning approximately 50,000 buildings to rubble every year creates two-thirds of all the waste produced in this country. If the UK is ever to translate its net zero ambitions into reality it will need to change the entire building industry.

R&amp;A’s Slumbers says announcement ‘sends a strong signal’

The Women’s Open has been handed a status and financial boost ahead of tee-off at Carnoustie with a $1.3m prize fund increase to $5.8m, making the tournament the most lucrative in female golf. On Sunday the champion on Scotland’s east coast will collect a cheque for $870,000 (£632,000).
Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A’s chief executive, announced the fillip for this major championship with considerable glee on Wednesday. And no wonder: Slumbers promised the pot at Muirfield in 2022 will be at least $6.8m. Between 2014 and 2016, the purse had been fixed at $3m, with the winner’s share always less than $500,000. Slumbers has credited AIG, the event’s main sponsor since 2019, with helping to elevate its status.

One of Papua New Guinea’s chief health officers has warned the country’s low testing rates, high percentage of positive tests and low vaccination rates provide a “recipe for major spread of the Delta variant” after the country recorded its 12th case of the deadly strain.
Dr Daoni Esorom, the deputy controller of PNG’s national pandemic response, said officials were so concerned that low testing rates were masking a serious outbreak that they had ordered doctors at the country’s biggest hospital to swab all corpses of people who had died from unknown causes or who had respiratory illnesses, to see if they had Covid-19.

Many Australians are experiencing “behavioural fatigue” after months of lockdowns, but rising case numbers have more to do with the highly infectious Delta variant than a sudden surge in rule-bending, experts say.
There has been a series of high-profile breaches of lockdown rules in Melbourne and Sydney in the past week.

The Society of Editors said it would now work to improve diversity in the industry and would no longer stand by statements made in March by its former director Ian Murray. He had strongly disputed claims by the Duchess of Sussex that negative coverage of her relationship with her husband, Prince Harry, was motivated by her skin colour.

Kojo Koram provides a useful corrective to the common, narrow perception of culture he describes (Here’s what the right gets wrong about culture: it’s not a monument, but a living thing, 16 August), but the “fossilised version of British culture” he identifies is not easily separated from the equally prevalent narrow, prescriptive notions about history that underpin it.
Too many people (and “culture war” fantasists in particular) approach history as an indisputable account of the past, when in fact historical understanding is a continual work in progress. This misunderstanding of history, both as a discipline and as an account, helps to entrench the view that culture is something fixed and unchanging and just as frequently invokes the equally problematic notion of “tradition” as a supposed trump card in arguments about both culture and history.

When rising British casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq started to raise public doubts 15 years ago, a new mantra began to be heard: Iraq was a war of choice, Afghanistan a war of necessity. The argument was that the US and its faithful ally, Britain, had launched an invasion in Iraq that was unjustified as it was based on a false premise: the hollow claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Sean Lock, who has died of cancer aged 58, was a bespectacled, besuited and well-groomed standup comedian who projected a constant air of puzzlement as he imparted his deadpan observational humour. His style was best summed up by his own assessment: “When it comes down to it, comedy is rehearsed moaning.”
He was adept at blending wordplay with slapstick and the occasional touch of the absurd, covering subjects from salad cream, 1970s furniture and messy family cars to the origins of cake decoration, golf on the radio and forgetting to take a “bag for life” to do the supermarket shop.

                    <span>The Guardian and other UK media demand action for those who have helped report from Afghanistan
• UK media repeat call for evacuation of Afghan colleagues
Dear prime minister and foreign secretary,
When British media organisations wrote to you earlier this month about the grave Taliban threat to Afghan journalists and translators who had worked with us, you responded almost immediately. You recognised their vital contribution to a free press by reporting on the British mission in Afghanistan and promised colleagues at risk a path to safety. President Biden did the same in the United States.

                    <span>For Starmer, the point was ‘what are the human consequences when power is held by someone so unfit?’
The initial shock of a packed House of Commons, recalled in recess for an emergency debate on Afghanistan, was how unfamiliar the packed green benches now look. Even before the pandemic, arguably since the prorogation of parliament, there’s been a question mark over the point of it all; does a debate have to end in a vote, in order to have meaning? Is it otherwise just theatre, and if so, what democratic purpose does it serve?
The answer used to be very simple: it was to test and challenge the policy of the executive. It may have been ritualistic, but the ritual was dense with significance, indicating that no prime minister had the power simply to announce, every one must persuade.

In a field in Norfolk, the sight of lush green leaves sprouting from the soil are giving farmer Ed Lankfer cause for optimism. “I think this is one of the best crops we have ever grown,” he says, surveying one of his fields of sugar beet.
The signs are promising so far for this year’s harvest – known in the trade as a campaign – which takes place later than for other crops, during the autumn and winter. It would mark quite the turnaround from 2020’s terrible harvest, when bad weather and pests caused yields of the white sugar-yielding root to plummet by as much as 60%, leaving Lankfer with a £12,000 loss.

Open letter urges Boris Johnson to make good on promise

British media organisations have again urged the government to evacuate Afghan journalists and translators who worked with UK media outlets, with many local staff fearing Taliban reprisals.
Dozens of local reporters and producers associated with British organisations remain in Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul on Sunday. This month the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, promised to consider relocating local journalists to the UK on an “exceptional basis” if there was evidence they were under imminent threat because of their involvement with Britain.

The University of Cambridge says it will cease teacher training courses if the government persists with damaging proposals to change how primary and secondary school teachers are trained in England.
Cambridge’s decision, which has been backed by its vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, is likely to be followed by Oxford and other universities that train thousands of new teachers each year, in a potentially huge blow to the teaching profession’s prestige and recruitment.

Rail fares in England and Wales are on track to rise at their fastest rate in a decade unless ministers decide to prevent steep price increases to encourage commuters back on to trains.
Annual increases in rail fares are usually governed by the July retail prices index (RPI), plus another 1%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday that RPI for July was 3.8%, meaning prices could rise by 4.8% in January. That would be the steepest increase since 2012.

Residents in the area sounded the alarm this week, posting footage on social media that showed scores of small fish and shrimp littering the beaches of the coastal lagoon known as Mar Menor in south-east Spain.

The Labour politician Austin Mitchell got his timing wrong. Had he entered the Commons 10 years before he did, he might have knuckled down and become a minister. As it was, he spent most of his first 20 years in parliament sitting in opposition, by which time his chance had probably passed, and the remaining 18 years, it sometimes seemed, commenting adversely and often publicly about the party and its leadership.
His sense of humour, which he thought of as bluff and bracing, often seemed to be somewhat awry, too. When he scoffed in 2014 that his constituency, Great Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, was so solidly Labour that “a raving, alcoholic sex paedophile” could get elected as the party’s candidate, he seemed surprised that anyone might take offence. But it was in truth only the latest in a trail of slightly off-pitch jokes made by a clever man and a frustrated politician.

Anne Bean has been revisiting her past. On 21 August the pioneering performance artist is taking part in a 10-hour “durational live event” as part of PSX: A Decade of Performance Art in the UK. Not only did this require her to look back on five decades of practice – her past work, she tells me, is “intimately linked” to her present – but it’s taking place at Bermondsey’s Ugly Duck, a stone’s throw from the Butler’s Wharf studio in London in which she worked from the mid-70s to the mid-80s.
Many artists at the time, including Derek Jarman and Andrew Logan, squatted in warehouses there, and in her time Bean has worked with everyone from slapstick clowns the Kipper Kids to artists such as Paul McCarthy and Rose English, as well as sharing bills with Psychic TV, Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. She even opened for Roxy Music as part of the pseudo-pop band Moody and the Menstruators, an avant garde performance covers group she founded in 1971. Bean has often used sound in her work and loves music – her father was a classical and jazz musician – but Moody was never supposed to be a real band, more “a subversive exploration of the boundaries between art and music”.

In their “cake-walk to power”, the Taliban seized American military supplies such as guns, ammunition, helicopters and combat aircraft. “Normally to get that many American weapons, you have to go to Walmart,” he joked.

Afghanistan latest updates – live

Other leaders have had the luxury of being able to deliver an uninterrupted televised address. But Boris Johnson had to justify the ignominious retreat from Afghanistan in front of a testy, and at times hostile, House of Commons – dominated by critics from his own side asking if Britain could have been better prepared and if the collapse of the Kabul government could have been averted.
It was an occasion the UK prime minister struggled to rise to, not helped by the format that Downing Street had opted for: a general debate, which meant MPs were allowed to rise and seek to intervene as Johnson spoke, generating a crescendo of background noise after he had completed a line or two.

Scream queen Barbara Crampton, the always-welcome star of many a smart if schlocky horror movie (see Chopping Mall, You’re Next, assorted Puppet Master flicks) is in her element here playing Anne, the mostly neglected and ignored spouse of suburban minister Jakob (Larry Fessenden). Years back, Anne had ambitions to travel and find adventure, but instead of marrying handsome classmate Tom (Robert Rusler), she settled for kindly if ditchwater-dull Jakob, and a lifetime of sitting in pews listening to his dreary sermons and talking to parishioners.
An assignation with old flame Tom, in town to buy a disused mill, and a stolen kiss seem like the prelude to a Mills &amp; Boon-style tale of middle-age adultery and lust. Thankfully we’re not going in that direction; instead, this turns into a blood-splattered vampire movie when Anne is bitten but not killed by a mysterious bloodsucker known as the Master (Bonnie Aarons from The Conjuring/The Nun franchise). Soon she’s wearing clever little chokers to hid her puncture marks, lipstick the colour of haemoglobin, and insisting Jakob take her out to dinner, service her reawakened libido, and generally treat her with more respect.

Malan returns to Test squad for first time in three years

Dom Sibley has been dropped from the England squad for the third Test against India at Headingley next week, with the team’s head coach, Chris Silverwood, admitting the batsman “needs some time away to regain his confidence”.
Sibley has finally paid the price for a prolonged spell of poor form with the bat – since he scored 120 against West Indies at Old Trafford last summer his average, which in eight matches up to that point had stood at 44.33, has fallen to 28.94. International opponents have repeatedly exploited technical failings – his past 15 Test innings include three ducks, five single-figure scores and a single half-century – while the pace at which he scores his runs has also been criticised.

They have marvelled at the birthplace of the Lindisfarne gospels, one of the most celebrated illuminated manuscripts in the world, admired the castle that towers over crashing waves and the ruins of the ancient priory, and watched thousands of grey seals basking on the sand banks.

It was high summer on the Italian island of Procida, too hot but somehow still green, and I was eating dinner at a beachside cafe that spilled on to the black sand of the west-facing Spiaggia di Ciraccio.
I wasn’t supposed to be here. Ten days earlier, a long-building romance with a screenwriter from Milan had ended abruptly. It had begun when our knees touched in his car. Long emails full of agony and promise followed, made all the less real for jumping between English and Italian, but then stopped. A short trip to Naples to try things in a new context was cancelled. I was desperately sad, but had already booked my flight to Italy and, as it happened, a friend was staying on the island nearby. So, I tagged along.

Afghanistan live news: latest updates

Boris Johnson faced a wall of fury from all wings of the Conservative party over the UK’s conduct in Afghanistan, with 11 former cabinet ministers among the dozens of MPs and peers expressing their anger and frustration at Britain’s failures in intelligence and preparation.
During a torrid session in the House of Commons, the overwhelming majority of Tories who spoke condemned Britain’s failure to anticipate the Taliban takeover of Kabul and its perceived humiliation on the world stage. More than 30 Tory MPs spoke against the government, while only a handful voiced support for its actions.

                    <span>Assigning someone the legal power to make decisions for a vulnerable adult should always be a last resort
Around the world, fans of pop star Britney Spears celebrated her father’s announcement last week that he would resign as her conservator. This development is welcome news for Spears and her supporters, dubbed the #FreeBritney movement. But it will not end Spears’ conservatorship, which has prevented her from making decisions about her own life since it was established shortly after she had a mental breakdown in 2008. Nor will it prevent others from finding themselves in similar situations. That will require changing the underlying legal systems that created Spears’ predicament.
While many have only recently learned of conservatorship thanks to the #FreeBritney movement, this legal process is neither new nor unique to the US. It is a common court proceeding in which the court appoints someone to make decisions for individuals the court has found cannot make decisions for themselves. California – where Spears lives – calls this proceeding conservatorship and calls the appointee a conservator. More commonly, it is called guardianship and the appointee is called a guardian. While Spears has drawn attention to guardianship, the process typically entangles those far less privileged. Changes in the pop star’s situation , as welcome as they may be, won’t themselves trigger the reform of a legal mechanism mainly experienced by people society has historically treated as expendable.

                    <span>Although teams can often defy financial logic for a time, to move up a tier is incredibly difficult
The easy thing is to blame the manager. It has become football’s default response to any crisis. A team hits a poor run or loses a big game: get rid of the manager. As Alex Ferguson said as many as 14 years ago, we live in “a mocking culture” and reality television has fostered the idea people should be voted off with great regularity (that he was trying to defend Steve McClaren’s reign as England manager should not undermine the wider point).
Managers are expendable. Rejigging squads takes time and money and huge amounts of effort in terms of research and recruitment, whereas anybody can look at who is doing well in Portugal or Greece or the Championship and spy a potential messiah. Then there are the structural factors, the underlying economic issues it is often preferable to ignore because to acknowledge them is to accept how little agency the people we shout about every week really have in football.

An unnamed source, said to be close to the inquiry, told the Reuters news agency that investigators viewed Prince Andrew as a “person of interest” over his friendship with Epstein as part of their investigation into possible co-conspirators.

Malta’s attorney general has called for a life sentence for the businessman Yorgen Fenech for allegedly masterminding the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, which rocked the country four years ago.
The attorney general, Victoria Buttigieg, laid formal charges against Fenech, who was arrested in November 2019 trying to leave Malta on his yacht, accused of complicity in the murder and criminal conspiracy. He has since been undergoing a pre-trial compilation of evidence where he pleaded not guilty.

It was one of the worst phone calls I’ve ever received: a friend in Kabul calling on Sunday afternoon to say that armed men had just visited her house. Her voice was shaking to the extent that she sounded as if she was gasping for air. The men had intimidated her and left, and she had fled to a friend’s house to hide with her children. She didn’t know when they’d return, if they would find her, or when it would be possible to relocate again to somewhere farther away. I have never heard someone sound so scared.
She begged for help to escape the country; I promised I would keep trying. But options were closing all the time. Earlier that day, through a small charity, I’d managed to get my friend and her children booked on to a flight to a third country. The plan was that they’d get to safety and continue to look for a more permanent relocation. It was a brief ray of hope during a dark few days. But within hours of the booking, all commercial flights out of Kabul were cancelled.

                    <span>The UK’s gun laws are strong, but loopholes exist. The police need the resources to conduct proper, effective checks
As a young police constable, I had to face an armed suspect in a cafe. Equipped only with a truncheon, I stared at the gunman as he aimed his weapon at me and pulled the trigger point-blank at my head. The gun jammed; I was saved from death, but not from recurrent nightmares. Whether because of this experience or in spite of it, I became, during my 30-year police career, a gold firearms commander and oversaw more than 200 operations, which included officers being shot, hostage situations and high-speed firearms chases. I came to respect the power of firearms, but to firmly believe that this is a power that needs to be reserved for the right hands with stringent checks and balances.
How Jake Davison, the 22-year-old man who shot dead five people in Plymouth, came to have a firearms certificate, and how that certificate was reinstated after it had been suspended after allegations of assault, will be the subject of detailed investigations. But a much more wide-ranging debate is needed about how guns should be regulated, how we enforce regulations and whether the postcode lottery of the present system is fit for purpose.

The esteemed German film director’s take on the life of Onoda, The Twilight World, will be translated by the poet Michael Hofmann, and published next summer by The Bodley Head. A memoir by Herzog will follow in 2023, reflecting on his life and the decades he has spent in the film industry, creating films including Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo, and documentaries Grizzly Man and Cave of Forgotten Dreams.

                    <span>Swinging London’s cultural melting pot was channelled into vibrant jazz by John Surman, Alan Skidmore and others – and it has inspired the resurgent scene of today
It was in the dusty depths of Birmingham record library in 2000 that Shabaka Hutchings first discovered the wonders of 70s British jazz. “I was 16 and I’d just moved back to England from Barbados,” explains the Sons of Kemet saxophonist. “The first record I played was John Surman and Stu Martin Live at Woodstock Town Hall, which starts off with this really gnarly synthesiser and sax. I remember thinking: this is pretty crazy. I know this sounds like a cliche but without it being punk music they were playing with this almost punk attitude.”
The scene Hutchings is talking about was a brief golden window, from 1965 to 1975, when London record labels and recording studios opened their doors to British jazz stars creating a unique sound that combined the US influences of Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Gil Evans with the London blues, folk and rock scenes plus West Indian and African rhythms. It’s a progressive and thrilling sound – “rawness, freedom, experimentation,” Hutchings says – that is now being documented in depth under the umbrella title British Jazz Explosion, with a scene-spanning compilation alongside a series of remastered original LPs.

Scotland‘s deficit more than doubled to £36.3bn, or 22.4% of GDP in 2020-21, the highest yearly figure since devolution, but it should not be an obstacle to making the case for independence, according to Scotland’s finance secretary.
Increased spending and falling revenues as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, compounded by the continuing oil price slump, increased Scotland’s notional deficit for 2020-21 from 8.6% of GDP in 2019-20, to 22.4%.

                    <span>Sean’s crazily funny gags reminded me why I got into comedy – his dry humour was always balanced with his wide-eyed wonder at the world
• Comedian Sean Lock dies aged 58
Sean was maybe a year ahead of me on the London comedy club scene and already had a reputation among comics as one to watch. He was really original and exciting and I wanted to be his friend. Physically tough, comfortable in himself and cool like Steve McQueen was cool, he was great company – very bright and naturally witty. He didn’t have to try too hard; he wasn’t one of those comics who was full of nervous energy and felt the need to be permanently “on”. We ended up sharing a flat together in Edinburgh for the festival. On his poster that year he billed himself as “The Natty Rebel Returns”. I liked that: “The Natty Rebel.”
I had an old 70s suit that I’d picked up in a charity shop – navy blue, pin striped, massive lapels and flared trousers but it fitted me like the loose cover on a secondhand sofa. Sean saw it and tried it on and it looked like I’d hoped it would look on me: dead smart but also just kind of odd, like he’d just got out of prison having been banged up in 1974. Although it broke my heart, I gave it to him to wear on stage and it became his look for a while.

                    <span>After the death of my mother, I wasn’t sure how my father, brother and I would knit ourselves into a unit. Could a sweaty nightclub in Lisbon hold the answer?
“We should go to the Ibiza closing parties,” my dad blurts out, driving through the rain in Hounslow. It is 2015; I am 21 and for the past few months he has been mentioning the phrase “Ibiza closing parties” as if it were a Buddhist chant. The radio is tuned to Magic, playing Fat Larry’s Band’s Zoom, and I mumble “yep, sure”, not listening at first.
I had been to Ibiza three years before, on a 72-hour school leavers’ bender – a series of “hot summer nights” of their own – and was awed by the tiny island’s cavernous clubs and the fact that they could charge €8 for a pocket-sized bottle of water. It was the trip that cemented my love for the dancefloor. In those warehouse spaces I realised that there is something deeply soulful about being surrounded by bodies locked into the communal groove, each of us moving to our own personal rhythms, unencumbered by the day’s worries and instead – hopefully – free to be how we want to be in this darkened space.

Cabinet ministers have been accused of undermining Covid advice and putting MPs’ and parliamentary staff’s safety at risk by declining to wear masks, as they packed the Commons chamber full to debate Afghanistan’s takeover by the Taliban.
Just two government frontbenchers chose to wear a face covering when parliament was recalled on Wednesday – the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and the new security minister, Damian Hinds – despite official guidance recommending they are worn in “crowded and enclosed spaces”.

‘With the year we’ve had, we just needed people to have insanely, intensely engrossing, almost relentless fun,” says choreographer Jade Hackett of the weekender she has curated for the Southbank Centre’s Summer Reunion series. Working with music producer DJ Walde under the umbrella of ZooNation dance company, Hackett is taking over the Thames riverside terrace for a free mini festival, three days celebrating UK hip-hop culture, and just celebrating full stop, having been starved of live shows and social occasions during the pandemic.
“It’s the first stepping stone to reintegration, bringing people together in a really safe way,” she says. “We’ll kick it off with music by Afrika Bambaataa, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, that’s the vibe; awesome social dances, the electric slide, Soul Train lines, it’ll be super fun.” Audiences can watch dance battles and performances from the likes of female popping collective AIM and Afrobeats dancers HomeBros, but there’s an emphasis on participation, with a series of workshops covering dance from the 70s, 80s and 90s as well as newer styles such as Litefeet. There are daytime family activities and evenings dancing to DJ collective The Midnight Train playing garage, grime, house, R&amp;B, hip-hop and soca – a little carnival fix for those feeling the gap left by the cancellation of Notting Hill carnival for the second consecutive year.

                    <span>New book details the enduring partnership of the former Leeds Rhino and his wife, Lindsey, and their refusal to give up living life to the full despite his MND
It’s quiet and peaceful in the summerhouse where Rob and Lindsey Burrow sit together. Pale Yorkshire sunshine streams in through the windows. We’re out in the garden in Castleford, at the home of Rob’s parents, and there are times when it’s possible to almost forget the deadly impact of motor neurone disease. Rob won eight Grand Finals with Leeds Rhinos as they dominated rugby league from 2004 to 2017 and he played 20 times for Great Britain and England in a celebrated career. But this once cheerfully garrulous man is now a silent prisoner in his body as MND paralyses him and prevents him from talking.
Rob still smiles easily and breaks his silence when he laughs. His vocal cords are in the grip of MND so it is no ordinary laugh. Sometimes, his short bark of mirth makes it sound like he is crying or struggling for breath. But his eyes confirm he is laughing. The pain and the sorrow are hidden then in the shadows beyond the summerhouse.

UK government ‘failing to help local leaders achieve net zero’

When Boris Afinogenov moved to Liverpool from Lithuania in 2011, he knew that most Britons preferred to live in houses rather than the Soviet-era tower block he had left behind. But in a rambling Georgian property, he quickly found himself missing his cosy old flat.
The idea of every home having its own boiler was also alien to him: in his town there were two municipal boilers for the entire population.

                    <span>From parents who meddle in their children’s relationships to ex-wives who loom over second marriages, families in fiction can be just as complicated as they are in real life
Uncomplicated, happy families are not to be found in most books – no more than in most homes. Family life is messy. Try getting several people into a car, or through an airport, and you’ll know how quickly family drama can escalate. And these are supposedly the easy bits. What about when there’s real trouble?
I’m drawn to stories of families under pressure, from without and within. In my story collection Shine/Variance, there’s a father smiling his way through a crisis while Christmas tree shopping with his son, a daughter pretending there’s nothing wrong with her mother, brothers and sisters realising who their parents really are. In my stories and this selection of books, we find families pretending everything is under control, when the reality is nobody knows what they are doing. All families make it up as they go along, in the hope that they’ll hold it together.

My favourite way to eat them is straight from the bag, but I occasionally manage to hold off long enough to cook something, and this juicy French batter pudding is usually top of the list.

I am an Afghan woman in my 20s, living in Kabul. I have five sisters. My oldest sister completed elementary school. The second one is a midwife, and my third sister is doing her PhD. My younger sister is a film-maker. And my youngest sister, she is a high school student and a member of a volleyball team. And I myself am doing my bachelor in one of Kabul’s universities. Although my parents are uneducated they have tried their best for their children to earn an education.
I have been working for a western NGO for two years advocating for women and working towards a stable, sustainable and equal society. When I heard the Taliban was taking over, I was worried about my future and about every single Afghan’s future, especially women and youth. It was a sad moment to think we women will return to the 1990s, and will live behind the closed doors and Burqa.

Sean Lock – a life in pictures

Tributes have been paid to the comedian Sean Lock, who has died of cancer at the age of 58.
Bill Bailey told the Guardian that Lock was as “brilliantly funny” off the stage as on, and that their daft conversations would leave him “helpless with laughter”. Bailey described him as a kind and generous man who was rigorous in his approach to writing comedy. In a writers’ room, said Bailey, Lock “spurred you on to find a better joke, a new line, the sweet spot of a perfect gag”. When the results worked, Lock would let out a “great gale of laughter”, Bailey recalled.

It wasn’t the first time a wildfire had descended on this northern California region and threatened the towns scattered through the forested mountainsides. Bray, the store director, knew first responders and anxious evacuees would need the extra electrolytes.

                    <span>Much has been squandered since 1991, but the biggest threat to democracy today is the global contagion of cynicism
On 19 August 1991, citizens of the Soviet Union woke up to the news that Mikhail Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist party, was standing down due to ill health. That news was a lie, as many of those citizens had come to expect from their media. Tanks rolling through Moscow told the true story: a coup by politburo hardliners, determined to abort Gorbachev’s experiments in democratisation. They failed. The coup unravelled within two days. Five months later the USSR had ceased to exist.
No one in the west saw it coming, but shock at the unpredicted event yielded to conviction that it had been inevitable. The implosion of a superpower built to fulfil Marxist prophecy should have served as a warning against all claims to know the rules of history and chart its destination. But no. The fashionable idea took hold in western policy that liberal democracy was the ideological terminus.

                    <span>Lewis Hamilton posted a picture of his dog, Roscoe enjoying a plate of fruit, while apparently travelling by private jet. But he is not the only star feeding their pup a plant-based diet
The first rule of flight club is you don’t talk about flight club. While a private jet might once have been the ultimate status symbol, travelling lavishly has turned into a liability for celebrities who want to be taken seriously. “What about yer private jet, then?” has, understandably, become the knee-jerk response whenever the privileged pipe up about the climate crisis. If you’re going to lecture the hoi polloi on how we need to make sacrifices to save the world, it’s a good idea not to flaunt your own excesses.
Alas, it seems Lewis Hamilton didn’t get the memo. The racing driver is a vocal vegan who has urged his fans to avoid meat for environmental reasons. Hamilton announced last year that his dog, Roscoe, is also following a vegan diet. While Hamilton got a bit of stick for his dog’s dinners at the time, a recent Instagram post featuring Roscoe posing by a fruit platter on what looks suspiciously like a private jet has sparked a fresh round of criticism. “I loves beings a vegans,” the photo’s caption (written in Doglish) reads. A section of the internet immediately decided that boasting about your dog’s veganism while on a private jet was the height of hypocrisy

I wouldn’t say I was a model employee in the law firm where I worked for nearly 10 years, but I was quietly reliable and kept out of trouble. That all changed when I was summoned to the office of the senior partner – a man I had never met – to face him, my distinctly sombre-looking boss, and a stony-faced HR rep. I was definitely in trouble: my employers knew about my anonymous blog.
The blog and work had been connected from the start. Trying to reconcile parenting two tiny children, intense hours and the demands of our terrifying clients as a solicitor in the City had proved impossible, so I had taken a backseat role in Brussels instead. It was not a job I particularly enjoyed, but it was easy and I never had to speak to bankers. The work was low-stress, but boring; inevitably, I spent those bored hours on the internet.

To overseas eyes, going into national lockdown over a single case should have been a hard sell, even for an extraordinarily popular prime minister such as Jacinda Ardern.
But a disastrous outbreak of the Delta variant in Sydney has helped galvanise New Zealand’s “team of 5 million” – and across the country, the government’s tough strategy on Covid-19 has enjoyed widespread popular support.

I wander up the side of the plot and stand among thousands of yellow flower heads, nodding gently in the breeze under an almost-blue sky. In the distance I can hear the sounds of London Gateway port, where ships as huge as the Ever Given can dock (the Suez canal blocker recently arrived at Felixstowe), but for a moment, I might be in Provence.

Pencils scratch as students in year eight feverishly work through an exam paper. At the back of the classroom, Clara Edna Chevambo, 37, a minute figure in hand-me-down clothes, finishes first and hands her paper to the teacher. As she leaves, her 11-year-old daughter is arriving for afternoon class. A vegetable farmer who supported, clothed and fed five children, her mother and her grandmother, Chevambo is now living in a borrowed tent in a camp, one of the ones with something to do to fill a few hours.
“I’m in school every day, and I don’t want to miss class. I send my daughter to school every day.”

The day the Taliban took over started with a call from my friend in Germany.

He put my name on their evacuation list because I had worked for German media, and I had been in the process of applying for a visa for the past year.

A Guardian investigation into the state of children’s services in the last 18 months has revealed a sharp rise in social services referrals during lockdown, plus spiralling costs for mental health support and a bulging backlog in the family courts, with some councils buckling under the weight of the extra work brought by coronavirus.
The Guardian’s Helen Pidd tells Rachel Humphreys about one shocking case of a 12-year-old boy physically and chemically restrained in an NHS hospital last month as his local council had run out of options of finding a suitable home for him.

Sweden’s only remaining mountaintop glacier, which until 2019 was also its highest peak, lost another two metres in height in the past year due to rising air temperatures driven by climate change, Stockholm University says.
In 2019, the south peak of the Kebnekaise massif was demoted to second in the rankings of Swedish mountains after a third of its glacier melted. Kebnekaise’s north peak, where there is no glacier, is now the highest in the Nordic country.

Coronavirus – latest updates

It was in the Lake District where William Wordsworth “wander’d lonely as a cloud” and the only crowd he saw was “a host of golden daffodils”.
Two centuries later, the park’s natural beauty is being eroded faster than ever before, ecologists are warning, as a result of the climate emergency and a huge influx of pandemic walkers.

Shareholders in the asthma inhaler maker Vectura have been urged to reject a £1.1bn takeover by the tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI), in an open letter signed by 35 health charities, public health experts and doctors from around the world.
Investors in the Wiltshire-based respiratory medicine specialist have until 15 September to decide whether to sell their shares to PMI, which has touted its ambitions for a “smoke-free” future but still derives 75% of its revenue from cigarettes.

The cephalopods – which have three hearts, eight arms, blue-green blood, regenerating limbs, and the ability to camouflage and exert self-control – only live for roughly two years.

Afghanistan crisis: live updates

Women, children and religious minorities will be prioritised in a new UK resettlement scheme for 20,000 Afghan refugees, Boris Johnson will announce, acknowledging that those who helped the western coalition over two decades are now most at risk from the Taliban takeover.
But most of the 20,000 are likely to have fled to neighbouring countries such as Pakistan before being resettled in Britain over five years, a Whitehall source said, unless the UK can strike an agreement with the Taliban to let people depart.

Raúl Jiménez has revealed that doctors told him it was a miracle he survived the skull fracture he sustained against Arsenal last November. The Mexican striker’s disclosure underlines how extraordinary it was that he returned to action on the opening weekend of the new Premier League season, completing 90 minutes in Wolves’ defeat at Leicester City on Saturday.
“I feel like a player again,” said Jiménez on Tuesday as he reflected on his recovery from the injury that he sustained in an accidental clash with David Luiz and which threatened not just his career but his life. “They told me it was like miracle to be there,” said the 30-year-old of his early conversations with doctors following the emergency surgery he underwent in a London hospital after being carried off the Emirates Stadium pitch on a stretcher and with an oxygen feed.

British number three Kyle Edmund has withdrawn from the US Open. The 26-year-old is still not fit after undergoing surgery on a persistent knee problem in March.
Edmund, an Australian Open semi-finalist in 2018, has not played a competitive match since losing in the first round of qualifying in Vienna last October. He has subsequently slipped down the rankings from a career high of 14 and is currently outside the world’s top 100, at 102.The American Denis Kudla has replaced Edmund in the main draw at Flushing Meadows, the United States Tennis Association announced. The US Open begins on Monday 28 August with Britain’s Dan Evans, Cameron Norrie and the former champion Andy Murray in the men’s field.

Instead, Walker has been put on a boat in the comedy crime drama Annika (Alibi). She’s the new DI at Scotland Police’s Maritime Homicide Unit. It sounds as made up as head of bicycle crime at the LAPD, or Alexander Lukashenko’s humanitarian adviser.

Bolivia’s recent interim government came to power by sidestepping constitutional rules for presidential succession and persecuted opponents with “systematic torture” and “summary executions” by security forces in the tumultuous aftermath of Evo Morales’s resignation in 2019, according to a new report by independent human rights experts.
The scathing 471-page report is the most comprehensive yet to examine the events surrounding the disputed 2019 presidential vote, when Morales’s narrow election to an unprecedented fourth term triggered widespread protests spurred by strong international allegations of voting fraud – claims later questioned by foreign electoral experts.

Hector Bejar, 85, who in his youth participated in a socialist guerrilla movement, had said he believed the Shining Path rebel group had emerged in part because of backing from the US Central Intelligence Agency.

                    <span>Large blazes are also burning in Portugal and Spain, the latest in a devastating European fire season made worse by the climate crisis
Hundreds of French firefighters battled to contain a raging wildfire near the Mediterranean resort of Saint-Tropez on Tuesday, with thousands of residents and holidaymakers forced to evacuate.
Roughly 900 firefighters were using high-pressure hoses, aircraft and helicopters in an attempt to control the flames, which began racing through the scrubland and trees of the Plaine des Maures nature reserve on Monday evening.

                    <span>The documentary The Smartest Kids in the World follows four frustrated American students as they explore different high schools abroad
Sadie, a 16-year-old high school junior in Harpswell, Maine, felt off-kilter in her American high school – too much memorization, not enough relevance to hands-on work in prospective careers. “I know it doesn’t have to be like this,” she says of her school days in The Smartest Kids in the World, a new documentary on international educational systems. Brittany, a junior outside Orlando, Florida, spends hours on homework but finds her curiosity unchallenged. “I kinda just wonder … what are we doing?” she muses. Jaxon, 16, from the small town of Saratoga in south-eastern Wyoming, finds himself torn between wrestling practice and sleeping two extra hours before his ACT, where one point marks the difference between free college tuition and $30,000 a year. “It’s only my life,” he shakes his head, “practically, everything in it.”

Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, who has died aged 84, was a disillusioned army captain who became the mastermind behind the coup that sparked Portugal’s Carnation Revolution, so-called because the people placed red carnations in the barrels of the soldiers’ guns.
The coup on 25 April 1974 toppled 48 years of authoritarian fascist rule and brought about the transition to democracy. With a population of nine million, of which a quarter of adults were illiterate, Portugal was the most impoverished country in western Europe.

Charities and patient groups fighting for greater recognition of the poorly understood condition as a medical illness rather than a psychological problem had welcomed the planned guidance, which was due to stop advising doctors to administer a controversial therapy.

Farewell, BHP, one of the largest companies on the London stock market at almost £130bn. 
The Melbourne-based mining company has tired of its clunky dual-headed Anglo-Australian corporate structure and wants to unify as a purely Australian entity with a primary listing in Sydney. It’ll keep a listing in London but it won’t be a “premium” version, the only sort that gets you into the FTSE 100. A large hole will appear in the UK’s blue-chip index.

Peri-peri chicken wings have become the latest casualty of Covid-related upheaval in the food industry, with a shortage of chicken forcing Nando’s to temporarily close a 10th of its restaurants.
The chain blamed the need to shutter outlets on staffing issues at its suppliers’ factories as well as the shortage of HGV lorry drivers that has resulted in gaps on supermarket shelves in recent weeks.

“Getting into crime was my fault,” he says. “But look at factors like a lack of opportunities, inequalities, household income, peer pressure, the people you hang out with, and how those things can have an influence. I thought: ‘You know what, I could start something.’”

Police increasingly believe that anti-women propaganda may have fuelled anger in the Plymouth gunman before his attack, with his links to the “incel” movement a main strand of their investigation.
Jake Davison, 22, shot dead his mother and four other people on 12 August. It emerged that he had engaged with extremist ideology including the “involuntary celibate” movement, though this is not considered to be enough for security officials to declare the mass shooting as a terrorist attack. Counter-terrorism officers continue to aid the investigation as detectives trawl through the attacker’s electronic devices.

                    <span>The fall of Kabul to the Taliban should spark a more honest debate about the UK’s unconditional support for US plans
The UK’s latest Afghan war, the fourth since 1839, has ended in failure. There is no consolation in claiming that this shameful retreat was down to a bungled withdrawal of US forces by Joe Biden. Britain scuttled out at the same time, the prime minister telling MPs on the day of Mr Biden’s announcement that “there is no military path to victory for the Taliban”. As events subsequently proved, Boris Johnson’s assessment of the situation was badly wrong. The extent of the military and political catastrophe for the UK that the blitzkrieg Taliban takeover represents is hard to overstate.
The UK is currently driven by a desire to stay close to the US. But America is a superpower, able to shrug off defeats and move on. The blow of losing Kabul is felt more deeply in a Britain shorn of substantial global influence. This has led the UK to take Washington’s lead in military affairs. In Afghanistan, the US judgment that a combination of special forces, local proxies and air power would wipe out domestic resistance to a military occupation was flawed. The Afghan security forces that Nato trained were exposed as a shell. In 20 years, according to Brown University’s Costs of War project, more than 170,000 Afghans have lost their lives. The death toll was rising. In June almost 1,000 Afghans were killed in the simmering civil war. A few weeks later half the country was under Taliban control.

                    <span>British ties with a historic European city deserve to be more widely explored
Many countries contain a city, sometimes more than one, that has acquired world fame while at the same time being an overlooked destination for busy visitors. In Europe, these cities are often places with long histories that morphed into industrial, commercial or trading hubs. Cities like Hamburg, Lyon and Turin can perhaps be seen in this way.
In Belgium, Antwerp is one of the most striking examples of this phenomenon of simultaneous fame and neglect. Antwerp is one of the great historic cities of Europe. In a highly readable new book, Michael Pye argues that, during Europe’s ages of discovery, it became one of the earliest genuinely global cities too. For much of the 16th century, it was what Paris, New York or London would become in later times, a place of restless wealth and vigour where, as Mr Pye puts it, anything could happen or at least anything could be believed.

The marchers wore badges saying “Don’t Turn Tragedy into War” and “Our Grief Is Not a Cry for War”, and argued that war was not the inevitable response to the terrorist outrage.

In a candidacy statement that appears likely to reignite a sometimes fractious internal debate about trans rights and the wider issue of the party’s internal structures, Shahrar Ali called for what he termed “a culture of open debate, where the taking of offence is not used as a means to prevent those who do wish to debate from doing so”.

                    <span>England captain back in training after isolation
Kane expected to have role in game in Portugal

Harry Kane returned to training with his Tottenham teammates on Tuesday after completing his period of isolation as the England captain prepares to make his first appearance of the season in the Europa Conference League.
Kane was absent from Tottenham’s opening-weekend victory against Manchester City on Sunday after being required to isolate following his return from holiday in the Bahamas, via Florida, and the Spurs head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo,  said afterwards that he expected the 28-year-old to “get ready and help the team” in the play-off against the Portuguese side Paços de Ferreira on Thursday night.

                    <span>Claim that wages element of formula is distorted by pandemic backed by latest figures, which would mean rise of over 8% 
Rishi Sunak has come under further pressure to suspend the state pension triple lock after wage figures showed that the chancellor is on course to pay pensioners a rise of more than 8% next year.
Sunak is understood to be considering telling Britain’s 12 million state pension claimants that the pandemic has artificially inflated the official wages figures and a new formula is needed to calculate the rise in the basic state pension for next year.

                    <span>Taste for difficult roles should help new chairman balance demands of  investors and regulators
When Adam Crozier arrived to run Royal Mail 18 years ago, during a time of turmoil and industrial unrest, he confessed to a taste for difficult roles. It’s a tendency he once described as “thrawn”, a Scots word meaning difficult or intractable.
The role in fact required considerable political skills in managing ministers – the Royal Mail was still government-owned – and a unionised workforce. Crozier will need those diplomatic skills once more as he takes the chair at BT, the former telecoms monopoly, to balance the demands of regulators and an array of heavyweight investors. BT’s board will be hoping the 57-year-old enjoys a smoother relationship with BT’s chief executive Philip Jansen – three years his junior – than the previous chairman.

Though it was 90 disastrous minutes in the field that led to England losing control of the second Test against India, it was their calamitous attempt to bat out the match which will provoke the most debate as Chris Silverwood convenes his selection committee on Tuesday night, with England’s head coach admitting that the repeated failures of top-order batsmen are an issue that he now “has to address”.
England, turbocharged by Joe Root’s unbeaten 180, scored 391 in their first innings, but across the match they also registered seven ducks including – for the first time on home soil – both openers in the same innings on that wild final afternoon.

                    <span>The widely detested 1997 adaptation and its various bizarre spin-offs are worth a reappraisal in this era in which nothing makes sense
Serious comic book fans and discerning cinephiles consider director Joel Schumacher’s Batman &amp; Robin from 1997 one of the worst films ever made – but they are wrong. It’s easily more entertaining than Christopher Nolan’s feted Batman trilogy (come at me Nolanites) – an endlessly quotable and absurd corporate climate change parable and the source of teenage mania among my early 2000s high school friends.
The intensely silly caper is more reminiscent of the 60s TV show, and Silver Age comics, than the brooding 80s publications that inspired Nolan and everyone since. Fans were understandably upset with the film’s reduction of Bane (one of Batman’s most intelligent foes) to a witless henchman; but in The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan and Tom Hardy turned Bane into a helium-fuelled, amateur Shakespearean actor, so, whatever.

                    <span>We call for visas, safe exit and humanitarian care for those now in need

This is an edited version of an open letter to Boris Johnson


With the Taliban now in full control of Afghanistan, women in the country face particular risk to their lives. As women’s rights and civil society organisations, we have been in touch with a number who have already received death threats. Some have the Taliban at their doors already. There is a particular risk to those who have acted to make a fundamental difference to what it means to be a woman or girl in Afghanistan: those brave enough to hold public office or start women’s rights organisations, those who have tirelessly spearheaded grassroots advocacy efforts and those fearless enough to hold decision-makers to account through their journalism. Some, through their work, have played a visible, enabling role in helping the British government achieve its own objectives. As a direct result of this exposure, these women now face a high and imminent risk to their lives.
Along with other civil society organisations working with partners in Afghanistan, we write with urgent concern about this risk. Collectively, we call on the British government to take action immediately. First, to work closely with governments of neighbouring countries and other international powers to ensure safe and legal exit from the country for women and their families at risk of imminent danger. This would include providing visas for and assisting with the escort and evacuation of Afghan women at risk. The government must work hard to ensure the country’s land borders stay open to evacuations and to facilitate aid, including supporting safe houses and gender-based violence services for women and their families who cannot flee.

                    <span>Readers on 20 years of the ‘war on terror’, the withdrawal of western forces and the rapid return of the Taliban
The fall of Kabul this week dramatically underlines the extent to which the “war on terror” – launched by George Bush and Tony Blair 20 years ago – has failed (US troops to stay until Americans and eligible Afghans evacuated, says Biden, 16 August). Stop the War argued from our foundation in October 2001 that the war in Afghanistan would neither end terrorism nor establish a peaceful and democratic state. Twenty years on, despite vast political, military and financial support from the US and Britain, the Kabul government proved a Potemkin regime.
Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The trillion-dollar cost of the war would have been better spent providing education, development and infrastructure. The Afghan people have now endured decades of war, largely imposed on them by western politicians. We must provide financial compensation and aid, not least by welcoming those who want to come here as refugees. We must also insist that our own government and MPs face up to the failures of the past two decades and call an end to the wars and interventions which have done so much damage across the world. Time for a different, peaceful course.

                    <span>Attacks by some politicians and journalists on public officials working from home are damaging morale, says one civil servant  
I was really disheartened to read recent attacks on civil servants by an unnamed cabinet minister (Civil servants working from home not at risk of pay cut, says Kwarteng, theguardian.com, 9 August). These constant verbal assaults and the implication that civil servants don’t work hard enough – that if we’re not in the office we must be watching television – are not only unequivocally false, but they’re damaging what morale is left in the civil service.
I’m a mid-ranking civil servant in the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. Like the majority of my colleagues, I’ve spent the past 18 months trying to juggle the needs of my day job with working on Covid management. It’s not my purpose to moan about this – I’m well aware that compared to the horrific experiences of medical staff and the pressures they’ve been under, we’ve had it easier than many. Still, I’ve seen colleagues regularly working 15- or 16-hour days or even longer, particularly at the peak of the pandemic. My colleagues set up the shielding scheme from scratch and at breakneck speed to make sure the most vulnerable in society were protected. Mortgage holidays, the ban on tenant evictions, facilitating the Everyone In campaign for homeless people – we’ve done all this and so much more while carrying on with the bulk of business as usual, establishing new schemes including First Homes and progressing building safety policy to try to address the horror revealed by the Grenfell tragedy.

Beheshta Arghand’s discussion with the spokesperson Mawlawi Abdulhaq Hemad is being claimed by the rolling news channel TOLO News as the first time an Afghan woman has conducted an interview with a senior Taliban official inside the country’s borders.

In 2019, Mara’s weekly performance review meetings grew intolerable; she would sit in a cramped conference room with her supervisors only to be told that she wasn’t performing well enough. “I felt like a child,” says Mara, who is 48, lives in Hampshire and works and works as a public servant. “They would tell me off. They’d say: ‘You won’t meet this deadline, will you? You didn’t put a paragraph in this document.’”
A year earlier, Mara had had a hysterectomy, to alleviate her endometriosis. Afterwards, in surgically induced menopause, she began to experience debilitating brain fog, anxiety and depression. “I was drowning,” she says. “I was overwhelmed. I couldn’t see or think.” Doctors prescribed antidepressants and oestrogen gel, but nothing helped. Mara could barely function at work. “I couldn’t retain anything,” she says. “I had no memory. I couldn’t see or think clearly enough to do my work. I had no confidence at all. I thought I was useless.”

It looks like the prodigal son is a painter now. Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s child, has apparently been dabbling with paints for years. Now his hobby has turned serious: starting soon, you can pick up one of his colourful creations from a gallery in New York’s SoHo. It will cost you, though: the pieces are reportedly priced between $75,000 and $500,000.
Who parts with that much cash for the work of a new, not exactly critically acclaimed, painter? We may never know. Hunter’s new career raises obvious ethical issues for his father and, in an attempt to avoid accusations of influence peddling, the Biden administration has asked the gallerist to keep all information about the buyers and prices of Hunter’s work confidential. The gallery has also agreed to reject offers that seem suspiciously generous.

Classrooms in England need air filters and monitoring devices fitted to protect children from Covid-19 and avoid further disruption to their learning, school unions have told the education secretary, Gavin Williamson.
The seven unions – representing teachers, school leaders, administrative and support staff – have written to Williamson asking for “urgent action” to improve ventilation when schools reopen for the autumn term without any requirement for children to wear masks or be grouped in “bubbles”.

Although the anti-war mood deepened in the UK in 2002, as President George W Bush moved to terminate the regime in Iraq, there had already been some unease the previous October, before the Afghan war started. One policy paper, which I co-authored, even argued against it, pointing to an inevitable escalation and the risk of never-ending war. But for the most part the defence establishment offered support.
In the event, the Taliban fell in a matter of weeks and Bush could announce, in his 2002 state of the union address, an expanded war against an “axis of evil”, with Iraq first in the sights. Even by mid-2002 the US, UK and others had moved on from Afghanistan, leaving a dangerous security vacuum, which was filled by a returning Taliban, across many rural districts, ultimately setting in motion the events that culminated in the past few days.

                    <span>Across a sprawling internet community, an ideology of violent misogyny is spreading – with tragic, ‘real-world’ results
The term “involuntary celibate”, or incel for short, used to describe somebody who isn’t having sex but would like to be, was first coined by a young woman named Alana in the mid-1990s. The small, supportive, mixed-sex community she created online is a world apart from the extremist, hate-fuelled ideology it has transformed into in the many years since she left those online spaces behind. “It feels like being the scientist who figured out nuclear fission and then discovers it’s being used as a weapon for war,” she later told the Guardian.
Today’s incels are not a clearly defined, organised group, but rather a sprawling, disparate community of men across a network of blogs, forums, websites, private members groups, chatrooms and social media channels. Several of the forums have memberships in the tens of thousands, with around a 25% increase in membership in the two years I have been researching them. And these figures don’t take into account the number of people visiting and being influenced by these sites without necessarily signing up.

                    <span>New head coach takes charge for qualifier against Okzhetpes
‘We have a chance against any Champions League opponent’

The Arsenal women’s head coach, Jonas Eidevall, says he aims to win the Champions League during his time at the club, and that the challenge was fundamental in his decision to join from the Swedish club Rosengard.
Arsenal return to the top table on Wednesday after missing out in six of the past seven seasons. They will face the Kazakh side Okzhetpes in the semi-final of a mini play-off tournament staged in Moscow; the winners will face PSV Eindhoven or Lokomotiv Moscow on Saturday for a place in the second round of qualifying, which feeds into a new-look group stage.

                    <span>The role of DJ Jason Mendoza catapulted the 33-year-old to fame. Now he’s starring with Kidman in Nine Perfect Strangers – and being entranced by Cruise in the Top Gun reboot
On YouTube, you can see Manny Jacinto getting the surprise of his life. During a break from filming, the stars of The Good Place are informed of the smash-hit comedy’s mind-boggling plot twist. Castmate Jameela Jamil covers her face with her hands. William Jackson Harper shouts out loud. Jacinto jerks his head around frantically, as if trying to make sense of this astonishing development purely through the power of repetitive neck movement.
“I wish I could bottle up that feeling and have everybody experience it,” says Jacinto wistfully, five years later. “It was incredible.” Fans of the heaven-set sitcom will know what he means: the revelation was up there with the best plot twists of all time (spoiling it would be a crime). Yet for Jacinto the show did far more than pull the rug from under him. Winning the role of nice-but-ridiculously-dim DJ Jason Mendoza sent shockwaves through his entire life, catapulting the 33-year-old from relative obscurity to the kind of stardom that invariably accompanies a Netflix success story.

Dawn Elrick had only been working as a runner in the TV industry for a few months when two male assistant producers told her they’d like to spit roast her. She was 22. She didn’t know what spit roasting meant so, that evening, she Googled it. “When I realised what they had said,” says Elrick, who is now 43, and works as a producer in Glasgow, “I felt so horrible.” She dreaded having to go back to work the next day.
A few years later, Elrick was working on an entertainment show. A presenter would pull her in for bear hugs, grabbing her buttocks as he did. At the wrap party, he cornered her. “He said that he wanted to come on my face,” Elrick remembers. She did not feel that she could complain to her supervisors. “It was such a busy production,” she says. “Everyone was trying so hard to get through it … No one had the space to deal with it.”

                    <span>A story for children about families with same-sex parents has been published in Russia as part of a campaign to have the country’s ‘gay propaganda’ law repealed
A month after a Hungarian bookshop chain was fined for selling a children’s story about a day in the life of a child with same-sex parents, the same picture book has been published in Russia – but with an “18+” label on it in deference to the country’s so-called “gay propaganda” law.
American author Lawrence Schimel and illustrator Elīna Brasliņa’s picture book tells about a morning and an evening in the lives of two children with same-sex parents. It is published as two titles in English – Early One Morning, about a young boy’s morning with his two mothers; and Bedtime, Not Playtime!, which follows a girl with two fathers at bedtime. The Russian translation, by Dmitriy Kuzmin, combines both books under the title Mothers, Fathers and Kids from Dusk till Dawn.

V-Adm Ben Key, the commander of joint operations, said there was now “considerably greater stability” on the ground, ending the “distressing scenes” of Monday when some desperate Afghans clung to military aircraft as they took off.

Freed from the shackles of the office and the misery of the commute, and with a newfound appreciation for space and air, it may suddenly have seemed as if a new kind of life was possible. Last summer, a few months after the first lockdown, data from Rightmove found searches by city residents looking for village properties had risen by 126%. But for those who took the plunge, leaving behind everything and everyone they know in return for a garden and a spare room, the pandemic has not made it easy to meet people in a new area. With this in mind, here’s some expert advice on how to build a new community.

Hannah Chase, a final year medical student at Oxford said the sense of urgency hit home recently when a fellow student confessed they didn’t believe in climate change. “It just shows that we make such assumptions,” said Chase. “It’s needed, this education.”

Tsiboukas lost more than 40 animals to the fire that destroyed more than 50,000 hectares. Peoples homes and livelihoods have been decimated. 
Hundreds of wildfires have torn through Greece this month on the heels of its most severe heatwave in decades, which left its forests tinder dry. Other Mediterranean countries – Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain among them – have suffered similar problems.
Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme weather events.

Martin Tugwell, who took over as chief executive of Transport for the North (TfN) earlier this month, is trying to persuade the government to pay at least £30bn to build a transpennine rail line called Northern Powerhouse Rail, as well as HS2 spurs to Manchester and Leeds.

Dan, Birmingham
Stuffed veg have a lot going for them: they couldn’t be easier to make, they can be served warm or at room temperature, they work with grilled fish, meat, salads or solo, and, perhaps most importantly, they always bring the holiday vibes. Essentially, we should all be getting, er, stuffed right about now.

In a statement, the board of Notting Hill Carnival Ltd said it had decided this year’s event in London “will not be on the streets due to the ongoing uncertainty and risk Covid-19 poses”.

The remains of Marcus Venerius Secundio were found in a tomb at the necropolis of Porta Sarno, which was one of the main entrance gates into the city. The tomb is believed to date back to the decades before Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.

                    <span>Queues for vital health checks have doubled in some areas as trusts try to tackle Covid backlog
NHS patients are waiting more than three months for tests including MRIs, colonoscopies and heart scans, with overall waiting lists doubling in some parts of England.
The number of people waiting more than three months for tests was 22 times that in 2019 as the health system continues to tackle the Covid pandemic backlog. Almost 124,000 people were kept waiting more than three months in 2021, compared with 5,675 in 2019. It is a slight fall from the May 2021 figure, which stood at just over 127,000.

                    <span>The foreign secretary was on the beach when the Taliban took Kabul. Welcome to Global Britain
What is the role of foreign secretary in the era of Global Britain? News that Dominic Raab was spotted lounging on a beach in Crete on the day Kabul fell certainly sends a message. The suspicion must be that the position of foreign secretary has key similarities with that of England football captain, which is of course a non-operational role roughly on a par with that of regimental goat.
For many years, people were positively obsessed with what sort of person should be England football captain, as though it remotely mattered which player pulled on the armband. It’s not cricket, or even rugby. The position of England football captain has simply never been used to influence a football match, yet as recently as a decade ago was being discussed as though it were one of the great offices of state, with its holder saying as much about our place in the world as about whether “the lads” had or hadn’t given it their all “out there”. The Italians simply give the captaincy to the oldest player on the pitch, which is perhaps something the British government might consider with the Foreign Office.

Getting drunk or looking for love, Florence Espeut-Nickless’s character commands the space, finding hope amid despair

Destiny is preparing for a big Thursday night out in rural Wiltshire. She leads us to her local nightclub, Karma, where the drinks are 50p and the evening will ultimately go sour, setting her on a path of desperate longing for love.
Though her existence is littered with misfortune – including distant parenting, limited finances and sexual abuse – she is full of hope. She has faith that things will get better. She dreams of showbiz and of being an MTV Base backing dancer. Her fantasies are long-lasting, her resilience inbuilt.
It is difficult not to warm to Destiny, written and performed by Florence Espeut-Nickless in a monologue directed by Jesse Jones, presented online for the Edinburgh fringe and supported by the Pleasance and by Bristol Old Vic’s Ferment programme. Despite her surface-level confidence, there is a naivety to her storytelling. As she repeatedly makes decisions that end in inevitable pain, she manages to find humour in her darkest moments – and you can’t help but laugh along, even if it’s at her fantasies about a TV presenter while she is having sex with a man much older than her. 
The spare set, designed by Joseff Harris, features quick-changing lights and a single chair: we’re almost completely reliant on Espeut-Nickless’s ability to command the room. This filmed version is performed to a live audience, and Destiny’s spirit is engaging early on. 
If her story is one we’ve probably heard before, it doesn’t make it any less authentic – and it is captivatingly told in the West Country vernacular of Destiny’s community. With endearing personality, she does them proud.
Destiny is available online and live at Bristol Tobacco Factory theatres, 7-8 September.

Poland has told the European Union it will shut down a chamber at its supreme court devoted to disciplining judges, an issue that has been at the heart of a dispute between Warsaw and Brussels.
The Polish government said on Tuesday that it had sent a letter to the European Commission on Monday, the deadline for Warsaw to inform the EU’s executive branch of how it would proceed after the EU’s top court said the chamber undermined judicial independence and contravened EU law.

Exxon has been extracting oil from Liza 1, an ultra-deepwater drilling operation, since 2019 – part of an expansive project spanning more than 6m acres off the coast of Guyana that includes 17 additional prospects in the exploration and preparatory phases.

In April 2020, near the start of the global pandemic, Felix Kartte was working 14-hour shifts as an EU policy officer, struggling to monitor a barrage of coronavirus-linked disinformation.
Articles claiming that the pandemic was a hoax, that it was caused by 5G, that it could be cured by hydroxychloroquine or alternative medicine were going viral across the continent – part of a global phenomenon the World Health Organization warned was becoming an “infodemic.” Kartte and colleagues in StratCom, the EU diplomatic service’s strategic communications division, could detect what they say were patterns of Covid-denier and anti-vaxxer disinformation linked to Russia and to a lesser extent China, being disseminated in several languages across Europe.

Kinloch Castle on the Isle of Rum was completed in 1900 as a playground for the wealthy textile heir Sir George Bullough, and now NatureScot – formerly Scottish Natural Heritage – can’t afford the costs of upkeep. That’s hardly surprising. Every detail of this building oozes extravagance: the exterior stonework has crenellations upon crenellations, while the interior was described by John Betjeman as “an undisturbed example of pre-1914 opulence”.
NatureScot is caught in an unenviable bind between an obligation to maintain an A-listed building and an inability to justify the profligacy it demands. To resolve this contradiction, a new owner is now being sought, someone with deep pockets who can preserve the castle while minimising its impact on the local environment, and contribute to the sustainability of the Rum community.

When you’re on Broadway and suddenly find out that your show is closing, you feel this wave of sadness. As a cast member, there was nothing you could have done to save it. You didn’t write the script; you didn’t call the shots. You just had to show up, and smile, and dance, and perform, and give it your all every day. Your cast has become like your family, the theatre like your home, and your dressing room like your own personal bedroom in that house, your space filled with photos, cards, and memories. After your last show, you have to take that all down, pack everything into a box, and walk out of the theatre as it goes dark.

Many thousands of people may have isolated unnecessarily because a government error meant they were “pinged” by the Covid app for a “close contact” in the prior five days rather than two days, a Whitehall whistleblower has told the Guardian.
As the isolation rules for double vaccinated people were relaxed on Monday, it has emerged that users were never told the app could notify of contact with an infected person as far back as five days before the positive test.

Swiss researchers have spent 108 days calculating pi to a new record accuracy of 62.8tn digits.

                    <span>More Britons than ever are flocking to wild places – but you need more than a mobile phone to avoid danger
Last month, I spent five days walking across the Peak District during that wonderful week of searing heat. Along the way, I ran into one tired-looking older gentleman who had no map and a scrounged bottle of water, a group of “lads” with an insufficient tourist map and no plan, and a lady unable to read her map.
More than ever before, Britons are flocking to mountains, rivers and wild places. That is a great thing, of course, but the price of entry doesn’t come without risk.
Instead of sneering at my brief trail friends in the Peak District, I advised where I could and cheered them on their way. The outdoors has enough know-it-all gatekeepers as it is. But had I been able to sit down …</span>

In June, I featured the case of WK from North Yorkshire, who had been waiting for more than two months for bp pulse to come and install a charging point at her home to enable her to start using her new Renault Zoe electric car. The charger’s installation had been part of the car’s purchase price.
I got the matter resolved, and noted at the time that this was the first complaint we had received about the firm, previously called Chargemaster before its BP takeover.

Water problems – drought, with its accompanying wildfires, and flooding – are likely to become much worse around the world as climate breakdown takes hold, according to the biggest assessment of climate science to date.
Global heating of at least 1.5C is likely to happen within the next two decades, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Temperature rises will be accompanied by big changes in the planet’s water cycle, with areas that are already wet becoming much wetter, and already arid areas becoming prone to greater drought. Extreme rainfall intensifies by 7% for each additional 1C of global heating, the report found.

                    <span>The zones can occur on a large scale, as at the equator, or at local level, causing showers and storms
Convergence zones are meteorological boundaries where two flows meet, forcing air upwards. This vertical movement of air leads to the formation of clouds, and heavy precipitation often follows on.
Convergence zones are a global phenomenon and can occur on a large scale, with one such example being the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ for short. The ITCZ is an area around the equator where the northern and southern hemisphere trade winds meet, creating huge amounts of uplift resulting in a band of heavy rain and thunderstorms around the equator. The ITCZ influences the wet and dry seasons in the equatorial region, including the monsoons.

During nearly five decades in showbiz, Sandra Bernhard has racked up title after title – comedian, actor, singer, author, radio host – and a reputation for controversy. She has worked with a long list of superstars, from Richard Pryor and Robin Williams to Robert De Niro and Cyndi Lauper. But she has never been overshadowed; her force of personality has guaranteed that. Even 30 years ago, the Los Angeles Times was paying homage to her “acid-tongued, antagonistic persona”.
But there are no cutting remarks today. On this sunny morning in LA, she appears relaxed, in a pink-striped shirt and trousers, reminiscent of the early 80s outfits she wore for her many appearances on Late Night With David Letterman.

Afghanistan live news: troops work to restart Kabul flights

As chaotic scenes unfolded more than 4,000 miles away in Kabul, veterans of the 20-year conflict and families who lost loved ones on the battlefield have been asking the stark question: “Was it worth it?”
“There is a generation of Afghans who have been given a taste of what freedom is like, so you never know, but it feels pretty bleak at the moment,” said Andrew Fox, a former major in the Parachute Regiment who served on three tours of Afghanistan and who has spoken openly about the impact of PTSD on his own health.

                    <span>A look back at the official photographs of Obama’s presidency shows his skill at conjuring a sense of pride and possibility – but today his victories seem narrow indeed
From the beginning, Obama’s team was invested in constructing a certain image of what would be deemed a “historic” presidency. During Obama’s campaign, the artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the famous “Hope” poster, was widely acknowledged as his key iconographer. But, in retrospect, who Obama was and what he represented endures in the public imagination thanks to the work of the White House photographer Pete Souza, a longtime photojournalist who first had the assignment under Ronald Reagan. Over time, Souza helped create a new image of race in the US. This was an image of a postracial nation, where postracial didn’t mean liberation – it meant a US where race was solely affect and gesture, rather than the old brew of capital, land and premature death. Progress would deposit us in a place where black would be pure style – a style that the ruling class could finally wear out.
In the thick of the 2008 primary, in an essay titled Native Son, George Packer argued that after a half century when “rightwing populism has been the most successful political force in America”, there was finally hope for an alternative. “Obama is a black candidate,” he wrote, “who can tell Americans of all races to move beyond race.” The ensuing years bore out the impossibility of that widely held belief, but it was already evident in the language. How could a single person be black and capable of moving everybody beyond race?

                    <span>The departure of US forces was followed by a rout of Afghan government forces. Now, after 20 years of western intervention, Afghanistan is back under the control of the Taliban
It began with a steady trickle of military defeats. First Afghan government control was ceded to the Taliban in provincial towns and cities. Then, as the lack of resistance became apparent, bigger cities and regional capitals began to fall. Finally on Sunday the Taliban entered Kabul as the western-backed government fled the country. 
The Guardian’s senior international correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, tells Michael Safi that it marks a stunning reversal for the Afghan government, which had begun negotiating a deal with the Taliban in recent months. And as deeply flawed as the government in Kabul has been for the past 20 years, it has created space for the education of girls and a free press. All of that is now in grave doubt as Afghans wait to see whether their new Taliban rulers plan to carry on where they left off in 2001. We hear voices from inside Afghanistan including reporter Zahra Joya, who was a child when US forces invaded in 2001 and drove out the Taliban. She describes her fears for what will come next.

About 3 million households in the UK could begin using low-carbon hydrogen to heat their homes and cook rather than fossil fuel gas under government proposals to attract at least £4bn of investment to the hydrogen economy by 2030.
The government has published its long-awaited plans for a UK-wide hydrogen economy, which it says could be worth £900m and create more than 9,000 high-quality jobs by the end of the decade, rising to £13bn and 100,000 new jobs by 2050.

US politics – live coverage

A defiant Joe Biden has insisted that he stands “squarely behind” his decision to pull US forces rapidly out of Afghanistan while attempting to shift blame for events unfolding there to his predecessor, Donald Trump, and the unwillingness of Afghan forces to fight the Taliban.
Biden is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the stunning fall of Afghanistan to the extremist insurgent force caught his administration flat-footed and raised fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.

                    <span>Evans refuses pre-match handshake with Allen
Allen eventually wins tightly fought first-round encounter 3-2

Any notion that the most extraordinary grudge match in snooker history would fail to live up to the pre-game billing was dispelled before a ball had even been potted. Snooker has had its fair share of eagerly anticipated showdowns in recent times but none have had a backdrop and subplot quite like this one. In the end, the match delivered just as much as the drama did.
How Barry Hearn, snooker’s grand supremo and lover of any off-baize action that generates publicity, must have grinned when Reanne Evans refused Mark Allen’s offer of a handshake before the break-off in their first-round match at the British Open in Leicester. There is, of course, way more to this story than ranking points, prize money or head-to-head meetings on the table but even that lit the touch-paper in a way nobody could have imagined.

The 23-year-old missed Wimbledon but returned to action for the Olympics in her native Japan, and agreed to take part in her first press conference in almost three months on Monday.

Officials have declared a dire water shortage at Lake Mead, the US’s largest reservoir, triggering major water cuts in Arizona and other western states. The US Bureau of Reclamation’s first-ever declaration of a “tier 1” shortage represents an acknowledgment that after a 20-year drought, the reservoir that impounds the Colorado River at the has receded to its lowest levels since it was created in the 1930s.
Already, the lake is at about 35% capacity – the white “bathtub ring” that lines its perimeter indicates where the water level once was. The lake’s level is projected to fall even lower by the end of the year, prompting cutbacks in January 2022, the Bureau of Reclamation announced Monday.

Medical teams and aid workers were racing to save lives and provide food and shelter on Monday amid fears that the official death toll from Saturday’s earthquake could rise further and a tropical depression bore down on the crisis-stricken Caribbean country.
The official death toll rose on Monday to 1,419, and at least 6,000 were injured by the 7.2-magnitude quake – a tremor even more powerful than the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that killed more than 200,000 Haitians in 2010 and levelled much of Port-au-Prince.

We open with newlywed Shane (Jake Lacy) batting away questions from a friendly couple in an airport departure lounge about where his wife is, as he gazes down at cargo labelled “Human remains” that is being loaded on to their flight. Then we flash back a week to his arrival (with his starry-eyed wife Rachel – Alexandra Daddario) at the exclusive White Lotus spa in Hawaii, as part of a similarly Waspy group of guests.

A new lawsuit alleges that Bob Dylan, the Nobel-winning folk singer-songwriter, plied a 12-year-old girl with drugs and alcohol before sexually abusing her in 1965.
The lawsuit alleges that the Times They Are A-Changin’ singer “befriended and established an emotional connection with the plaintiff”, identified in Manhattan supreme court papers, obtained by the Guardian, only as “JC” and groomed her over the course of six weeks in April and May 1965.

                    <span>Victory came in the modern India way – with a swagger and without taking a backward step
Ollie Robinson emerges from the darkness of the Long Room on his way out to the middle. England are 90 for seven and Robinson is about to face the hat-trick ball from Mohammed Siraj. All around the ground, India fans are in raptures. Standing at first slip, Virat Kohli is waving his arms, conducting them like an orchestra. The prevailing smell is of English blood.
As Robinson descends the pavilion steps, a couple of India players in tracksuits are coming back in the opposite direction, having just been out on the field delivering drinks. Robinson stops and waits for them to step aside. They do not step aside. Robinson waits. They wait. Eventually, after a fashion, they sort of awkwardly squeeze past each other. The whole encounter lasts barely a couple of seconds and yet as a motif for this bruising, absorbing final day it is hard to beat.

Afghanistan live news: troops work to restart Kabul flights

The streets of Kabul were emptied of women on Monday, the first full day of Taliban rule across Afghanistan, as Taliban gunmen patrolled in cars seized by police, confiscated guns from security guards and urged shopkeepers and government employees back to work.
Chaos unfolded at the airport, where troops used guns and helicopters to clear the runways, and several people died in frantic last-minute attempts to escape by clinging to departing planes.

Life moves fast in Matsena Productions’ piece, which charts boyhood and the clumsiness of adolescence
Perfectly suited to the new outdoor stage of MultiStory, Rituel, from Matsena Productions, is a captivating journey through the ebullience of childhood and into the clumsiness of adolescence. It’s devised and performed by Shane David-Joseph, Johnny Hail, Charlie Layburn, and Anthony and Kel Matsena, with the last two leading the creative process.
After casually welcoming a drifting audience that filter in and orders drinks to their bubbled seats – this is no ordinary Edinburgh fringe – the cast ripple into action. Performing as toddlers who subsequently grow into young men, they race from playground antics to puberty and drunken misadventures with boyish flair.

Afghanistan will not compete at this month’s Paralympics in Tokyo, after the team were unable to leave Kabul as a result of the Taliban’s conquest of the country.
Zakia Khudadadi had been set to become the country’s first female Paralympian when the taekwondo fighter was named alongside the discus thrower Hossain Rasouli in a two-person team. On Monday, however, it was confirmed that neither athlete had been able to take their scheduled flight out of the country.

                    <span>UK health regulator also says data does not support link between jabs and changes to menstrual periods

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines raise the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth or affect fertility and the ability to have children, the UK’s health regulator said on Monday.
Data gathered so far also does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and Covid vaccines, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It said the menstrual changes reported post-vaccine were mostly transient in nature: “The number of reports of menstrual disorders and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to both the number of people who have received Covid vaccines to date and how common menstrual disorders are generally.”

                    <span>A reckless western withdrawal timetable has let a people down
Earlier this year, a bipartisan panel appointed by the US Congress advised against the “precipitous withdrawal” of American troops from Afghanistan. The panel warned of grave consequences if Joe Biden allowed himself to be driven by dates and a strict timeline, rather than a realistic assessment of conditions on the ground. Mr Biden, who had inherited a 1 May exit deadline from Donald Trump, ignored this advice, naming instead a new date. All US forces would be gone by 11 September, exactly two decades after the invasion prompted by the al-Qaida attack on the World Trade Center.
A timetable bound up with domestic political symbolism has handed over Afghanistan to the Taliban and millions of Afghans to a frightening and unstable future. In the spring, a Biden administration official said: “We went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked us on September 11th … We believe we achieved that objective some years ago.” These words were presumably intended to convey a pragmatic determination to end a “forever war”, as well as a neat sense of narrative closure. Today they read like an insular, inward-looking rationale for an abdication of responsibility that will scar the Biden presidency.

                    <span>Many people have mixed feelings about arachnids, but like many more popular animals they need our help
Much less visible for most of the year, spiders make their presence felt in late August and through the early autumn. This is the mating season of some of the most common varieties, when male house spiders come out of hidden corners to look for females, and garden spiders reach adult size and spin their biggest, most dazzling webs.
Yet while the spider is familiar, the star of one of the great children’s books, Charlotte’s Web, and a fixture of nursery rhymes and Halloween decor, its relationship with humans is complicated. Fear of spiders, arachnophobia, is common and has serious impacts on the lives of sufferers. Its prevalence appears unrelated to any rational assessment of risk. Spiders in the UK are almost all harmless. Farmland species perform valuable ecosystem services, by predating on insects that are our competitors for crops. But they have proved durable repositories of human anxieties – with a cultural association with witches and wickedness dating back to the middle ages.

Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward’s third book about Donald Trump will be called Peril, completing a trilogy begun with Fear and Rage. According to its publisher, it will also include sections on the first months of Joe Biden’s presidency.
Woodward rose to fame in the early 1970s, working with Carl Bernstein to uncover the Watergate scandal which brought down Richard Nixon. Peril is another co-production, this time with Robert Costa, also on staff at the Post.

                    <span>When playwright Finegan Kruckemeyer imagined a worldwide circuit breaker for the climate in 2019, he wasn’t expecting it to hit so close to home
In the opening scenes of Hibernation, a minister from Australia’s ruling conservative party updates the parliament of 2030 on the unfolding climate crisis. Regional Australia is riddled with ghost towns, whole nations are underwater, and there’s a flood of climate refugees lapping at our still-shut borders. “Everybody is the victim of what is happening to our planet,” spits the unsubtly named Warwick Joyce (Mark Saturno), “and everybody is the culprit”.
His answer? A miracle sleeping agent first developed for the colonisation of space that can plunge human beings into a deep, perfect slumber. But rather than using the gaseous drug to aid an exodus from our doomed planet, Joyce says, why not force the entire human race to sleep – to collectively take our foot off the gas – for one year?

Gerard Piqué was 13 or 14 the day the Barcelona manager came to tea. When his grandfather proudly introduced him as the future Camp Nou centre-back, Louis van Gaal walked over and without a word pushed him to the floor. Standing over him, he looked down at this kid lying there and delivered a devastating verdict: you’re too weak to play for Barcelona.
Twenty-one years, 567 games, eight leagues, eight cups and four European Cups later, a World Cup and a Euros too, he’s not just still standing; he’s carrying the club on his shoulders. Well, someone has to.

                    <span>Bill Kingdom says the battle against Covid provides lessons in how to cut consumption to ease global warming. Plus letters from Sue Dalley, David Hughes and Dave Hunter  
In Adam Tooze’s article (By pushing for more oil production, the US is killing its climate pledges, 13 August), he surmised that economic activity and fossil fuel consumption are hardwired together. It may be more that economic activity and energy consumption are hardwired together – and thus the need to move to renewables or low-carbon energy sources. That must be part of the strategy, along with as yet unavailable technical solutions such as carbon capture.
However, we seem to tiptoe around the consumption part of any strategy. Lower consumption results in lower carbon emissions. The government has managed to exert strong influence over personal actions during the Covid pandemic using a myriad of three-word slogans. We need a similar push linked to consumption and climate change.

For some teenagers, the promise of a Deliveroo discount was enough to tempt them to get the Covid vaccine. For others, staying in their parents’ good books was far more important.
“My mum told me to,” said one 17-year-old after receiving her first vaccine along with her friends in Bolton on Monday afternoon. Arsalan Azhar, 18, said he too was just obeying orders: “We would like to have some incentives,” he said. “But it was due to my parents. They will be more relaxed now.”

                    <span>Defeats in Champions League final, Community Shield and at Spurs have exposed a familiar failing but are City prepared to spend £160m to solve it?
The roles were reversed at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday. By the end, with Tottenham sticking to Nuno Espírito Santo’s plan after Son Heung-min’s clever breakaway goal, it was Manchester City who looked like they needed to become the Harry Kane team. Spurs had found a way to play without Kane, striking on the counterattack, and City had allowed the game to run away from them, their lack of conviction in attack a worry despite the presence of a £100m signing making his first start.
Early days, of course, and it is fair to acknowledge that Pep Guardiola’s side were not at full strength when they began the defence of their title. Context matters in spite of City’s vast resources and allowances must be made for the absence of Phil Foden, the rustiness of Kevin De Bruyne, and Guardiola levelling the playing field by picking Nathan Aké and Benjamin Mendy when John Stones, Kyle Walker and Aymeric Laporte were available.

Joe Biden could not have been clearer: a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was “not inevitable”, the US president said on 8 July. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, was equally confident – “there is no military path to victory for the Taliban” – he told MPs earlier that day, five weeks ago.
The president said he trusted “the capacity of the Afghan military”, who were better trained, better equipped and “more competent in terms of conducting war”. The prime minister agreed: “I do not believe that the Taliban are guaranteed the kind of victory that we sometimes read about.”

Oluo’s examination of race in America, So You Want to Talk About Race, was published in 2018, and hit the bestseller charts in the wake of the killing of George Floyd last summer. Jessica Natale’s similarly-named Instagram account @soyouwanttotalkabout was launched in February 2020, tackling topics such as voting rights, gun reform and the sentencing of Derek Chauvin, laying out information in a series of slide-shows in muted tones. By April this year, Natale had landed a book deal with Little, Brown, and revealed her previously-concealed identity.

Will, a personal assistant working in London, used to avoid coffee shops before lockdown. But since life started getting back to normal he has signed up for a subscription with Pret a Manger. “I didn’t buy much coffee out before lockdowns, but £20 for unlimited coffee has me popping into the nearby Pret every morning for a black filter and maybe a croissant,” he says. He’s back in the office full-time now. “I usually bring my lunch from home, but if I’m running late or forgot ,I’ll grab a sandwich with my morning coffee, too.”
Elsewhere in the capital, Daisy Baldwin, a 34-year-old communications manager, has also started buying food and drink during the working day. “I never spent money on lunch or coffee – or very occasionally as a rare treat – but now I am working from home I like to support my local cafes by buying a sandwich, juice or even an ice-cream one or two times a week,” she says. “Saving the cost of commuting means I can afford to splash out a bit more and I feel more connected to my local community than pre-pandemic.”

                    <span>Daniel Raboldt’s low-budget but visually impressive film has more than a whisper of A Quiet Place about it, as two survivors fight their robotic overlords without making any noise
This plucky Kickstarter-funded German sci-fi from director Daniel Raboldt comes with a distinct whisper of A Quiet Place, as well as Luc Besson’s almost dialogue-free film The Last Battle. Taking place in a war-against-the-machines future, its purist approach poses a few storytelling challenges, leaving its two protagonists at times gesticulating at each other as if in a post-apocalyptic game of charades.
Tomasz (Stefan Ebel) is a survivor in a man v machine conflict in which the latter are decidedly on top. He hunkers down in an abandoned house in the wilderness, setting up a perimeter forcefield to protect himself. That done, there’s not much to do other than get high on a weird blue narcotic. But out inspecting his generators one day, he’s waylaid by Lilja (Siri Nase), a fierce-eyed woman in a pair of Uggs (which, like cockroaches, appear able to survive armageddon). He wakes up bound and gaffer-taped, with her furiously soldering robot parts as though she’s trying to root out their secrets.

• NHTSA identifies 11 crashes involving first responder vehicles
The US government has opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s driver-assistance system known as Autopilot after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles.
The investigation covers 765,000 vehicles, almost everything that Tesla has sold in the US since the start of the 2014 model year. Of the crashes identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as part of the investigation, 17 people were injured and one was killed.

It was meant to be a leisurely break as Spain sweltered through record-breaking temperatures. But beachgoers in the southern province of Granada inadvertently found themselves in pursuit of a pair of alleged drug smugglers after a cannabis-laden boat careened on to their pebbled shore.
The chase began on Saturday evening after maritime police spotted a suspicious boat off Melicena beach. Police boat in tow, the small vessel headed full tilt towards the beach, seemingly oblivious to the bathers, chairs and umbrellas that dotted the shoreline.

An academic is suing Leeds Beckett University after she was dropped from her advisory role over tweets calling a mixed-race man a “house negro”, alleging the decision was discriminatory because of her belief in critical race theory and Black radicalism.
The university ended its association with the academic adviser Aysha Khanom after accusing her of “racist language” in relation to tweets using the terms “house negro” and “coconut” – the former in a question.

Cherie Blair has joined a campaign to force the men-only Garrick club to admit women, as a growing number of female lawyers protest against the unfairness of rules that exclude them from a networking institution used by senior judges and politicians.
Signing a petition calling on the club to change its membership rules, Blair recalled watching her fellow trainee barrister and future husband Tony Blair being admitted into the club in 1976, while she was shut outside. She described the lack of progress as “outrageous”.

School and college leaders have condemned the government’s plan to ban mobile phones from classrooms as outdated and out of touch, arguing that schools should be allowed to decide on appropriate rules.
Responding to a Department for Education (DfE) consultation on student behaviour, the Association of School and College Leaders said education leaders already had student mobile phone use under control and warned that some students, such as those caring for a relative, may be disadvantaged by a strict approach.

                    <span>Western involvement in the country was a post-imperial fantasy that has led to the current ghastly situation
The fall of Kabul was inevitable. It marks the end of a post-imperial western fantasy. Yet the west’s reaction beggars belief. Call it a catastrophe, a humiliation, a calamitous mistake, if it sounds good. All retreats from empire are messy. This one took 20 years, but the end was at least swift.
The US had no need to invade Afghanistan. The country was never a “terrorist state” like Libya or Iran. It was not at war with the US; indeed the US had aided its rise to power against the Russians in 1996. The Taliban had hosted Osama bin Laden in his mountain lair through his friendship with the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar. At an immediate post-9/11 “loya jirga” in the southern city of Kandahar, younger leaders pressed the mullah to expel Bin Laden. Pakistan would probably have forced his surrender sooner or later. After the 2001 invasion the US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld demanded that George Bush “punish and get out”.

NHS England hospitals have sounded the alarm over materials used in roofs that reached the end of their lifespan more than a decade ago, with one hospital forced to restrict the use of some operating theatres to patients under 120kg (19st).
Several hospitals are warning of the potential for roof collapses due to structural weaknesses in the reinforced concrete planks used in their construction between the 1960s and 1980s, which have a 30-year lifespan.

Some time over the past 18 months, I went from having perfect vision – the kind of vision that means, “Here, let me have a look” is your catchphrase, and that makes you mock your friends for the font size on their mobiles – to being unable to even read a menu. You have no idea how much I wanted to add a sweary prefix before “menu”.
I always thought people were attention-seeking when they went through that performance of getting their glasses out at the table. Come on, it’s going to be garlic bread, soup and chicken liver pate. Surely you could have guessed that? I didn’t realise how it would feel when the text was swimming about indistinguishably or how rare it is these days that the first sentence is “garlic bread”. Now I realise it’s just as likely to be bread with a medjool date whipped butter, or garlic bread with a cheesy crust. In my pride, I have spent ages ordering things that weren’t there.

I adore parmigiana di melanzane, with its layers of sweetly acidic tomato sauce, grilled-until-collapsing aubergine and generous amounts of oozing, stringy cheese. It can, though, feel a little rich to have all on its own, and decidedly too much work for a midweek side dish. While you can get around this easily enough by serving it with a delicious salad, when spinach and chard are bursting out of the ground, I love to wilt them in a little oil and add them in layers to give extra goodness to this comforting dish.

The shy new arrivals are joining a menagerie of animals at his rewilding project in Devon. They are in a large pen with a four-metre-high fence but Gow, like a growing number of conservationists, wants to see lynxes prowling freely in the countryside.

Elderly and isolated people are among thousands who face being without television or radio for nearly three weeks after a fire at a Yorkshire transmission mast.
Television and radio services have been disrupted for up to 500,000 people across North Yorkshire and north-east England since Bilsdale mast caught fire last Tuesday.

                    <span>As the climate changes, census data shows that Americans are shifting from safer areas of the US to the regions most at risk of heating and flooding
Science has provided America with a decent idea of which areas of our country will be most devastated by climate change, and which areas will be most insulated from the worst effects. Unfortunately, it seems that US population flows are going in the wrong direction – new census data shows a nation moving out of the safer areas and into some of the most dangerous places of all.
To quote Planes, Trains and Automobiles: we’re going the wrong way.

                    <span>The swift rise of the Chinese video-sharing app could have ramifications for all of us and how we live, both online and off
Against the backdrop of a global pandemic that has kept millions of people inside with nothing but their phones for company, the short-form video-sharing app TikTok has quietly ascended to the top ranks of tech. TikTok was the world’s most downloaded app last year, and according to App Annie, a mobile analytics company, in March 2020 alone, users spent as much time on it as there has been since the stone age: 2.8bn hours, or nearly 320,000 years. Last month, TikTok became the first app not owned by Facebook to cross the 3bn download mark. For context, there are 5.3bn mobile phone users worldwide.
By now, you’ll almost certainly know the name TikTok, even if you’ve never used it, perhaps through word of mouth from nagging children or grandchildren, or the sheer bombardment of TV adverts over the past year. Parent company ByteDance turned over $34bn in revenue in 2020, and clearly isn’t shy about spending it to acquire new users: at the Euros this summer, for instance, TikTok’s logo was emblazoned on every advertising hoarding in sight.

                    <span>There are thousands of names for pasta, but before all came those joyful, humble lumps of dough known as gnocchi. How do you like yours?
“In the beginning was the gnocco.” When I first read that line by Corrado Barberis, president of Italy’s National Institute of Rural Sociology, I got slightly hysterical. Let me explain: it was last summer, inordinately hot, and I was holed up in a dark room writing a book about pasta, or rather 50 stories about 50 shapes, and things were not going well. In fact, they were going very badly, and I hated the book, myself and everyone I could hear having what sounded like the time of their lives in the piazza below.
After looking for the answer on social media, then feeling even worse, I picked up the masterpiece that is Oretta Zanini de Vita’s Encyclopedia Of Pasta. Now, I should add that at the time we were working our way through The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings double trilogy at home, so I may have been influenced by that when I opened it looking for a sign.

In 2018, Anita was enjoying life in Boston and, on Halloween, she went out for drinks. “My friend started talking to someone, but I wasn’t interested in joining their conversation,” she says. Luckily, she spotted someone else to distract her. “I saw this very attractive guy with a warm smile and went to speak to him.”
Taylor, who had also been out with friends, was gearing up to go home. When Anita approached him, he was instantly drawn to her. “I couldn’t hear a word she was saying over the noise of the bar, but I thought she was phenomenally beautiful, so I tried to keep showing my interest,” he says. They went downstairs, where it was quieter, to continue their conversation. “I loved how tall he is. I’m 5ft 9in and he’s 6ft 5in,” says Anita.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

It’s embarrassing to tell a patient being discharged from hospital that they can’t be seen for months. Or assure them that you will check with the clinic booking team, when you know there is no capacity. It’s demoralising to work long hours in A&amp;E only to have more people waiting for treatment than when you started your shift. To know so much of your work in the emergency room would be unnecessary if outpatient services were not stretched beyond their limits.
Damaging waiting times have existed for years, caused by the government’s refusal to properly fund the NHS. Waiting times for GP and hospital appointments were the second most common reason given in a 2019 King’s Fund study about why patients were dissatisfied with the NHS. The pandemic has exacerbated this problem. Some 1.2 million people in England have now been waiting over six months for essential services, a figure that is almost five times higher than it was in 2019.

                    <span>Now more than ever, children are cooped up indoors and monitored 24/7. But how can they build confidence and social skills if adults never let them out of their sight?
She describes herself as having been a “fairly cautious” parent before the pandemic, but Shannon now worries about her children’s safety more than ever. “The pandemic has made me more paranoid and fearful of other people,” she says. She has two sons, aged seven and four, and she’s anxious about them falling ill “because they are too young to get vaccinated”. When her elder son’s school reopened last year, she kept him at home. “We don’t go inside other people’s houses, and, if we have play dates, we do them outside,” she says. As a hospital chaplain in Indiana, Shannon has seen people dying of Covid, so her fear is understandable.
There have been benefits – her sons are closer than ever – but she acknowledges the downsides. “That social aspect of their development is something I’m definitely worried about. There’s a part of me that’s like: ‘Let them be kids,’ and there’s a part of me that’s like: ‘I need to keep them safe.’”

‘We are historical interpreters: we are here so people don’t have to read the book,” says Aidan Turnbull, from the comfort of an open 15th-century toilet in the grounds of Dover Castle. Turnbull, an expert in medieval intestinal parasites, is dressed as a gong farmer – a nocturnal emptier of cesspits, who would remove human waste or “night soil” from Tudor latrines.
Though the effects of Covid-19 on the UK’s community of medieval knights, Roman centurions and Crimea nurses has not made headlines, many re-enactors have been without work since March 2020. Armed with some thankfully odourless props and boundless enthusiasm, Turnbull and his fellow re-enactors are clearly thrilled to be back sharing their passion for British history with the public.

Chichester harbour in West Sussex is one of the most highly protected marine environments in the country. But the latest analysis from Natural England shows that 80% of its protected habitats are in an unfavourable or declining condition.

                    <span>It’s time to ditch the old cliches and to change the way we think about Olympic athletes, who are humans rather than robots
Chris Boardman signalled the shift when he summed up British Cycling’s performance at the Tokyo Olympics: “Fewer medals but a better story.” What could he mean? We all know sporting performance pushes forward. Innovation never stops as athletes look deeper and search further to raise their game. The new territory this time is fresh vocabulary, human stories and different thinking.
The Paralympics are poised to begin, the Beijing Winter Olympics follow next year, with Paris 2024 not so far away. Olympians of different ages and from different nations are challenging us to shift our mindsets and broaden the lens on what we see and take from the Games. Our language as spectators, journalists, politicians or sports leaders needs checking. There was a new vernacular spoken in the performance arenas of Tokyo. Take your favourite most-quoted phrases and question whether an athlete would say them any more. Here’s three to start:

                    <span>Before they were superstars, Joan Rivers kissed and tried to kill a young Barbra Streisand on stage – or so she claimed. Now her tall tale has inspired drama The Funny Girls
In the late 1950s, a 25-year-old struggling actor named Joan Molinsky – later to become better known as the acerbic comedian Joan Rivers – landed a small part as a lesbian stalker in an off-off-Broadway play called Seaweed. “The primary qualification for being cast,” her biographer Leslie Bennetts later wrote, seemed to be “that she had lots of relatives who would come see her in a play”. The significance of Seaweed from a historical point of view is that she was starring opposite another superstar-in-waiting, whom she described in her memoir Enter Talking as “a skinny high school girl with a large nose and a pin that said, ‘Go Erasmus!’”.
This was 17-year-old Barbra Streisand, who played her unlucky victim. Rivers recalled “a big love scene in which I told Barbra I loved her very much and she rejected me and I had a knife in my hand and tried to kill her and then myself”. It’s delicious to imagine these two future divas in a clinch in some airless New York attic in front of an audience “sitting there in overcoats … coughing, like a tubercular ward”, as Rivers put it.

Ten days ago Robyn McCarthy was eagerly preparing for the return of her six-year-old son to in-person classes at his Miami public school at the start of the new school year. After 18 months of grueling lockdown at home, learning through Zoom, it was finally time for the boy to re-enter the world outside.
“We were excited and we were ready,” McCarthy said. “We’d bought the uniforms, we had the masks all ready to go. We felt confident that the school would do a great job in keeping our son and everybody else safe.”

When a shackled Mansoor Adayfi was lumped on to a heap of shivering, naked bodies in the pitch black, a hood over his head and muffs around his ears, he assumed he was going to die. He had just been conducting research in Afghanistan, and was expecting to begin university at the end of the year. Instead, he was accused of being an al-Qaida leader, kidnapped by Afghan warlords and handed over to the CIA.
He was kept in a prison camp in Afghanistan, then shipped to Guantánamo Bay. He remained hopeful. Aged 18, coming from a tribal area of Yemen with no electricity or running water, Adayfi did not know much about US values, but he assumed some principles held true in most of the world: that every person should be innocent until proven guilty; that if you have nothing to hide you should tell the truth; and that all humans, regardless of who they are, have rights.

                    <span>A dance-based ‘soul journey’ – in the middle of Clapham Common? While I stream with sweat and onlookers laugh, I can’t stop worrying about what I’m having for dinner
I’m shaking my pelvis with brio, when a goldendoodle ambles up. Don’t you poo, I think. Then again, doing what comes naturally is the point of today. My friend Beth has invited me to try 5Rhythms: a silent disco movement meditation class on Clapham Common. I didn’t understand any of those words, but said yes­, because this column has turned my life into a second-tier Jim Carrey film­. Now I’m in deep with the hippies. To my left, a man in socks and a bandana is romancing a tree. A nearby game of touch rugby has paused so its players can laugh at us. This is my nightmare.
5Rhythms was developed in the 1970s by Gabrielle Roth, a New York theatre artist, but moved mainstream in the last 15 years, adopted by the wellness crowd. The practice involves dancing to five distinct moods of music, in a specific sequence known as the wave, which corresponds to different aspects of the self. The resulting “soul journey” is designed to unlock unlimited creativity and wholeness in the psyche of the dancer. Assuming they buy into the new-age framework, that is. My own personal five rhythms are lazy, dissatisfied, hungry, laughing and a freeform malaise I refer to as Kenneth.

                    <span>The hippy movement may have been in decline since its 1960s heyday, but there are still Europeans who choose an alternative lifestyle. During the pandemic, when many people are considering whether there might be a different way to live rather than returning to old ways, journalist Roberto Palomo journeys through Portugal with some of those who are living outside established society
The pandemic disrupted so many people’s plans, including mine. As a freelance reporter, my scheduled trip through South America in search of stories disappeared and I had to look for alternatives. In spite of everything, I got a job during lockdown in a logistics warehouse and was able to save some money. Once the restrictions began to relax, I bought an old van and, with the help of some friends, adapted it to make it my new home for the next months.
I am from Badajoz, a small city in the south-west of Spain a few kilometres from the Portuguese border. I have been visiting Portugal since I was a child but I never had the opportunity to explore the neighbouring country in more depth. With the world paralysed, this was my chance.

                    <span>The Tories see culture as something that needs to be protected, but it’s a shifting landscape transformed by each generation
The culture war, much like the war on drugs or the war on terror, is a metaphorical state that seems fated to go on for ever. The left blames the right for instigating a cynical distraction from its economic and public health failures; the right insists it is merely acting in self-defence after years of clandestine advances by the left. The indefinite nature of this battle stems from a general failure to define what is being fought over, or to determine what is meant by culture, where it comes from or why it matters.
One of the people who thought hardest about the idea of “culture” that so preoccupies today’s culture warriors was Stuart Hall, the sociologist and founding figure of British cultural studies. Hall arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1951 to find a rigidly hierarchical society that was undergoing profound social changes in the aftermath of the second world war. The “Windrush generation” had been recruited from the far corners of a fragmenting empire to help rebuild a devastated mother country, bringing with them new music, food and language that would reshape Britain’s atmosphere. At the same time, television, cinema and radio were spreading a new, irreverent image of British culture around the world, while the rise of the welfare state and increasing disposable income among working people meant the audiences for art and sport were growing just as their barriers of entry began to lower.

                    <span>Turning her camera on her customers, the sex worker and photojournalist  exposed the male gaze to itself – and opened up a world of shame and desire
“As a rebellious preteen, I sat down and made a list of my life goals,” writes Cammie Toloui in her photobook 5 Dollars for 3 Minutes. “It was pretty simple: 1. Sex. 2. Drugs. 3. Rock’n’roll.”
Born in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Summer of Love, Toloui was in the right place to hit these targets, and by 1990 was a member of a feminist punk band, Yeastie Girlz, and working at the Lusty Lady strip club. Stripping was part-rebellion and part-necessity because Toloui was studying photojournalism at San Francisco State University and the Lusty Lady paid well, but when she was given an assignment to shoot her own life, it also became a project. Deciding not to photograph herself or her colleagues, because female nudes have been seen so many times before, she trained her camera on the customers.

                    <span>Andy Street says the region’s new Tory voters need concrete policies to match Boris Johnson’s ‘levelling up’ pledge
Boris Johnson has been urged by one of the most senior Conservative figures outside London to match the symbolism of his “levelling up” pledge with concrete policies.
Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands, said the prime minister had shown he was “not for turning” in the face of Tory heartland MPs worried the party would neglect its traditional voters, but pressed him to set out a “full policy platform” in the coming months.
Fresh from securing an increased majority in the May local elections as one of the few Conservative metro mayors, Street cautioned that the swathes of “red wall” voters who backed the party for the first time in 2019 “want to see delivery”.
The former John Lewis managing director also called on ministers not to rely totally on public spending to boost the life chances of those in impoverished areas, instead saying that leveraging significant investment by private businesses was “the only way out of this country’s economic challenge”.
Speaking from Wolverhampton College, Street conceded the idea behind levelling up was “not completely new”, instead pioneered by former prime minister David Cameron – meaning it had already been “in action” for several years.
However, he praised Johnson for vowing to make it “the defining mission of his government” and admitted that while a landmark speech Johnson gave in Coventry last month on his priorities as the UK emerged from the pandemic did not contain everything he wanted to hear, he was confident those announcements would come.
Street said: “He could easily have turned his back on that after Covid. But actually, no, he’s leaning right into it. And he’s also telling his party – and this was what was so important – that that is what the Conservative government’s going to do.

There is one correct way to start an interview with the new host of Mastermind: turn the tables on him – put him in the chair, under the spotlight. He hasn’t prepared a specialist subject, though, so I pick one for him, an easy one: the life and work of Clive Myrie, gleaned from previous interviews and the internet. There may be errors, but I can accept only the answer on the card. It will lead to topics for discussion. He is up for it, he says, although his face says: “WTF?”
The setting – a meeting room at the BBC’s New Broadcasting House – isn’t perfect. The lighting is all wrong. There are chairs, but not the chair. At least I can play the theme on my phone. Bam baba bam, bam baba bam, da da …

Lord Deben, the Conservative peer and chair of the climate change committee, said critics of the net zero policy had been vocal in the public debate because “it hasn’t been put into context by the government”.

A bride price – or mahr – is one of the important aspects of an Islamic marriage contract. It is a gift, or a promise of a gift, to the wife by the husband. It is agreed between the parents or guardians of the bride and the groom verbally or in writing shortly before the couple’s marriage.

                    <span>While western governments get ready to administer booster shots, millions in Africa are still completely unprotected

Gordon Brown hits out at EU’s ‘neocolonial approach’ to Covid vaccine supplies

In a shocking symbol of the west’s failure to honour its promise of equitable vaccine distribution, millions of Covid vaccines manufactured in Africa that should have saved the lives of Africans have been shipped to Europe in recent weeks. Indeed I have learned from African leaders that, this month and next, about 10m single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) vaccines filled and finished at the Aspen factory in South Africa will be exported to Europe, at the very time that Africa is grappling with its deadliest wave of Covid-19 infections yet.
Compared with the swift development of the pathbreaking Covid vaccines, getting shots into all the world’s arms should be straightforward. But vaccine nationalism – and Europe’s neocolonial approach to global health – is dividing the world into rich and protected people, who live, and those who are poor, unprotected and at risk of dying.

One of those who did was Karl Gray, a 60-year-old Salvation Army minister from north London. He was admitted to Homerton hospital, in Hackney, in the UK’s first wave on 4 April. He couldn’t breathe. The last thing he remembers is the ambulance reversing into the bay. The rest is blank.

                    <span>Property site Rightmove says market for smaller properties experiencing record highs despite overall decline
UK house prices fell in August amid a drop in demand for bigger homes after the government scaled back its stamp duty tax break for buyers in England and Northern Ireland this summer, according to Rightmove.
The property website said the national average asking price of a home had fallen by 0.3%, or about £1,000, over the past month, and now stood at £337,371. However, it said buyer demand remained strong for smaller properties in particular, and that it was predicting an “autumn bounce” in prices.

The UK government has launched an investigation into renewable electricity deals amid growing concern over the extent of “greenwashing” by large energy firms claiming to offer environmental benefits to customers. 
In a crackdown as increasing numbers of people switch to a renewable energy deal, the government said it would review how the sector markets its green electricity tariffs to consumers.

Dutch defender warns it will take time to reach very best

Virgil van Dijk says his return to action for Liverpool this summer has felt “very emotional and very tough”, and that he has jumped a mental hurdle after recovering from 10 months out with anterior cruciate ligament damage.
Liverpool enjoyed a comfortable evening at newly promoted Norwich on Saturday, winning 3-0 and experiencing only occasional alarm at the back. The conditions were ideal for Van Dijk to play his first competitive football since being injured at Everton last October, and he explained that he felt ready after coming through a challenging comeback game last month when Liverpool lost 4-3 against Hertha Berlin in a friendly.

The organisation said unpaid labour was a growing problem in the age of increased home working, with women at a greater risk of negative health impacts and mental distress.

Taliban enters Kabul – live updates

The final collapse of the 20-year western mission to Afghanistan took only a single day as Taliban gunmen entered the capital, Kabul, on Sunday, President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, and America abandoned its embassy in panic.
Even the militants themselves were surprised by the speed of the takeover, co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar admitted in a video statement in the evening. Now the group faces the challenge of ruling, he added. They are expected to proclaim a new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan soon.

                    <span>“We can’t live in the past; we have to live today and tomorrow,” Ronald Koeman said and so they did. It may have been a single night, there might have been just 20,384 supporters here, and most important of all there was no sign of Lionel Messi – not on the pitch, at least – but it was the first time any of them had been in the Camp Nou for 526 days and, for all the depression, they came determined to enjoy the return, departing happy as a new era opened with a 4-2 victory over Real Sociedad.
On a hot, sticky and noisy evening the melancholy was momentarily gone, a cautious optimism taking its place. It has been 17 years, and it is not easy to let go, but for most of the 90 minutes here Barcelona’s fans did, driven by a kind of collective desire for closure and the performance of their “other” players, two goals from Martin Braithwaite and one each from Sergi Roberto and Gerard Piqué taking them to victory.

While the US currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day – a 700% increase from the beginning of July – that number could jump in the next couple weeks, Dr Francis Collins said on Fox News Sunday.

New coach heartened by Trinity’s spirit

Willie Poching has been promised an open audition to convince the Wakefield Trinity hierarchy he is the right man to succeed Chris Chester as the club’s head coach. This was about as impressive an opening gambit as he could have hoped for, even if there was a late reminder of how much of a challenge this job is.
Anything other than a Wakefield win here would have been unfair on the hosts, who dominated large periods of the contest against a Warrington side who were, in their own coach’s words, “unacceptable” in the first half.

Early on Sunday morning I was heading to university for a class when a group of women came running out from the women’s dormitory. I asked what had happened and one of them told me the police were evacuating them because the Taliban had arrived in Kabul, and they will beat women who do not have a burqa.
We all wanted to get home, but we couldn’t use public transport. The drivers would not let us in their cars because they did not want to take responsibility for transporting a woman. It was even worse for the women from the dormitory, who are from outside Kabul and were scared and confused about where they should go.

This was Manchester City with the flaws on the outside; this is what they look like when things go wrong, as they have twice before against Nuno Espírito Santo sides, and weirdly often against Tottenham. Football’s finances may be ruined and the game sinking into a moral mire but there is still comfort to be drawn from teams, despite it all, remaining resolutely themselves.
City began with great pace and urgency, slicing Spurs open so frequently the game might have been over within 10 minutes. But then having failed to score, the mechanisms became gummed and, more troublingly, they looked extremely vulnerable on the counter‑attack with Lucas Moura a constant menace.

                    <span>Upside down, they resemble a pair of scales
Dragonflies have a near-perfect hunting record, successfully grabbing their prey in mid-air 95% of the time: they do this while flying skywards, earthwards, side to side, backwards and upside down. In one experiment, a dragonfly with numbers drawn on its clear wings alights backwards from a reed, legs raised above its head like a person making an offering to God, and scoops up the bug flying behind it. The dragonfly appears to catch its prey both benevolently and malevolently: snatching it and saving it, like a ball or a falling baby.
Dragonflies transform from their larval stage with similarly precise acrobatics: the skin splits, the insect wriggles its head and chest out with the awkwardness of someone trying to get into a sleeping bag while standing up, and then it hangs upside down for a while, its tail still trapped in the skin. The almost-dragonfly regains its strength, then does an upside down sit-up at the same time it pulls and flicks its tail out: a perfectly controlled dismount, a precisely calibrated monkey acrobat toy.

Fred’s maximum sustained winds at 40mph Sunday morning

Florida’s governor declared a state of emergency for the state’s Panhandle region as Tropical Storm Fred moved through the Gulf of Mexico early on Sunday and parts of the Caribbean were preparing for the impact from Tropical Storm Grace.
Fred was forecast to move across the Gulf before reaching the coast Monday night or Tuesday morning, forecasters said. They said people from Alabama to the central Florida Panhandle should monitor the system’s progress.

Fall of Kabul – live updates

Not eating, not sleeping, and checking WhatsApp and social media feeds every second has become the reality for many Afghans in the UK. They are frantic with worry but say all they can do is stand by and witness the unfolding tragedy with a mounting sense of helplessness.
Dr Mohammad Haqmal, a public health director and academic who lived under the Taliban in Afghanistan and is now settled in the UK, says his fears for his sisters and brothers and their families trapped in Kabul are too great to put into words.

Primoz Roglic finishes 33rd but retains leader’s red jersey

The Belgian rider Jasper Philipsen won stage two of the Vuelta a España on Sunday by edging the bunch sprint at the end of the flat 166km stage from Caleruega to Burgos as Primoz Roglic maintained his overall lead.
The Alpecin-Fenix rider timed his surge to the finish line perfectly to pass the UAE Emirates rider Juan Sebastián Molano, who went too early and was easily caught before finishing fourth. The Dutchman Fabio Jakobsen was second with the Australian Michael Matthews third, all crossing the line in 3hr 58min 57sec.

Comparisons are odious and nearly always absurdly reductive but here we go anyway. In 2012 Lionel Messi set a new record for goals scored in a calendar year. Let’s not try too hard to be iconoclastic: his tally of 91 for Barcelona and Argentina in 2012 was one of football’s monumental achievements, a jaw-dropping effort over the long haul, even if the only silverware it earned him that year was the Copa del Rey. Poor Leo did not get too much bang for his buck there.

The history of western interference after the second world war in countries throughout the world has been one of unmitigated failure for which we all bear a share of shame (UK and US send troops to aid evacuation from Afghanistan as Taliban advance, 13 August).
Western powers have invaded countries thousands of miles away in the name of “democracy” and achieved a vacuum of power that has swiftly been filled by the very forces they went to evict. Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. We have left behind devastation and despair while never learning the lessons of each disaster. If people want a one-party state, why does the US and its poodles think it has a duty or right to impose a very flawed system of democracy on other nations? Hubris followed inevitably by nemesis.

Patrick Butler is right that the pandemic has made the crisis in children’s social care “even more acute” (Crisis in children’s services in England is shocking if not surprising, 11 August). However, it is difficult to see how the government’s review of children’s social care will achieve the radical changes needed, for two reasons.
First, it will require a commitment to more progressive taxation and increases in the minimum wage and universal credit to combat major inequalities, including those associated with the rising demand for children’s and youth services: childhood poverty, social deprivation, homelessness, poor health, ethnicity and disability.

                    <span>Post-Covid, the state can help workers find new jobs in blossoming sectors when old jobs in obsolete ones wither away
Last August, Rishi Sunak was so confident that Covid was banished he said the furlough had to go. About 4 million workers would have either been forced to return to their jobs or found they had no job at all. “It’s wrong,” Mr Sunak told the BBC, “to keep people trapped in a situation and pretend there is always a job that they can go back to.” But it was Mr Sunak who was wrong. The pandemic was not over. A new, more transmissible Covid variant would soon appear. By October 2020 the furlough was back. Such an experience ought to chasten a politician. But that does not appear to be the chancellor’s style. He talked last week about the economy “bouncing back”. The furlough, he says, will disappear by the end of September. Is Mr Sunak once again tempting fate?
Britain has eased pandemic restrictions, but the country is not out of danger. A more virulent Covid strain could emerge. Mr Sunak, however, is betting that vaccine coverage and booster shots will allow Britons to live with the virus. The chancellor can also draw comfort from the Bank of England, which believes that mass layoffs have been averted and unemployment has peaked. The first week of August saw 1.7m active job ads, while 1.9 million people are on furlough. For some this will mean higher pay and better benefits. It may just be catchup. Half of British workers suffered a real-terms pay cut last year despite a sharp rise in average earnings.

                    <span>How can Britain persuade other countries to ditch fossil fuels when it won’t do so itself?
Boris Johnson’s apparent willingness to sign off a new oilfield, Cambo, in the North Sea makes a mockery of his claim to global climate leadership. The first phase of Cambo would produce up to 170m barrels of crude. That is the equivalent, say Friends of the Earth, of the annual emissions of 18 coal-fired power plants. This sends dark clouds scuttling over the UK’s presidency of Cop26, held in Glasgow in November this year. For the UN climate summit to be a success, Mr Johnson’s team, headed by Alok Sharma, must cajole recalcitrant countries into line. It is doubtful that Mr Sharma can persuade other nations of the merit of forsaking fossil fuels when Britain will not lead by example.
Last week, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its starkest warning yet about the planetary emergency. To have a 50% chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C requires the world to get net emissions of carbon dioxide down to zero before 2050. In a foreword to the IPCC report, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, wrote that countries should “end all new fossil fuel exploration and production”. The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental group founded to protect access to hydrocarbons, has said much the same.

Pret a Manger is plotting to expand outside London and other big city centres as large numbers of office workers continue to work from home, with plans to open 100 franchised shops, plus about 100 of its own outlets.
The coffee and sandwich chain has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic as its city centre outlets suffered from the absence of commuters and tourists. But the company said that in some regional towns its shops were busier than they had ever been.

Greatly admired by her fellow artists and a devoted army of fans, Nanci Griffith, who has died aged 68, exemplified a style of musical storytelling with a literary flavour, focusing on the small details of the lives of her characters. Songs such as Love at the Five and Dime and Gulf Coast Highway have become permanent fixtures in the folk-country canon (Griffith described her music as “folkabilly”), and the Grammy award she won for her album Other Voices, Other Rooms in 1994 seemed a long overdue reward for her carefully crafted body of work.
While that album comprised versions of other people’s songs, other artists appreciated the quality of her own material. Love at the Five and Dime, from Griffith’s album The Last of the True Believers (1986), was a Grammy-nominated country hit for Kathy Mattea, while Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson sang Gulf Coast Highway on Harris’s hit album Duets (1990). Suzy Bogguss had a country Top 10 hit with Griffith’s Outbound Plane.

                    <span>From Khartoum to Kansas, vaccine conspiracy theorists have one thing in common: they have lost their faith in government

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

It’s hard to explain what it feels like when someone you thought you knew intimately starts to repeat conspiracy theories about the pandemic and vaccines. You don’t really grasp what’s happening immediately: it’s too vast and jarring a realisation to gulp down in one go. So you go through phases. First you clutch at straws. Perhaps it’s a bad joke, or they didn’t really mean it, or they’re just misinformed. Then you enter a stage of hot, disorienting rage and frustrated remonstration. Once that is spent, finally you cool off. But inside you is a leaden realisation that not only is this person you love putting their life at risk: perhaps you never really knew them at all.
People with the wildest theories about the pandemic can be found in countries even where most people don’t have access to the internet, cable TV or the shock jocks of commercial radio. A common impulse is to write off those espousing conspiracies, consigning them to the casualties claimed by WhatsApp groups, disinformation or silent mental health issues. These things may be true – but vaccine hesitancy is a symptom of broader failures. What all people wary of vaccines have in common, from Khartoum to Kansas, is their trust in the state has been eroded. Without understanding this, we will be fated to keep channelling our frustrations towards individuals without grasping why they have lost trust in the first place.

Taliban enters Kabul – live updates

The Taliban have 80,000 troops in comparison with a nominal 300,699 serving the Afghan government, yet the whole country has been effectively overrun in a matter of weeks as military commanders surrendered without a fight in a matter of hours.
It is a tale of two armies, one poorly equipped but highly motivated ideologically, and the other nominally well-equipped, but dependent on Nato support, poorly led and riddled with corruption.

                    <span>The artist and social media critic on his work subverting the manipulative practices of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter
When the history of the first decades of this century comes to be written, there will be few more telling artworks than Ben Grosser’s film Order of Magnitude. In the 47 minute video, Grosser, a digital artist and professor of new media at the University of Illinois, has spliced together every public instance in which Mark Zuckerberg has talked of “more” and “bigger”. The resulting montage of interviews and presentations is a fast forward of the rapid growth of Facebook as, in the chief executive’s mouth, thousands become millions then billions. It makes a mesmerising monologue, the story of our times.
“The idea that Zuckerberg latched on to even more than anyone else in Silicon Valley,” Grosser suggested, when he spoke to me from Urbana via Zoom last week, “was the need to grow as big as fast as possible, get the largest market share. And everything was subservient to that.” The film is part of a double act. Grosser has also spliced together all the moments he can find of Zuckerberg ever mentioning numbers diminishing or things getting smaller. This film runs for 30 seconds, though in a new version for his forthcoming exhibition at the Arebyte Gallery in London, he has slowed those seconds down so it also runs for 47 minutes.

                    <span>(Glassnote)
The singer-songwriter continues to impress on a second album that beguiles equally in its rockier and softer moments
“Swear I’ve got a sign written on my back,” storms Jade Bird on Candidate, a raw-edged rock bruiser about being a dickhead-magnet. With her second album, the English singer (who attended the Brit School and is now based in the US) is concerned with confounding first impressions made by 2019’s Jade Bird, an arresting debut of Americana-tinged pop rock driven by remarkable songcraft and that sweetly serrated force-10 voice.
And yet for all the avowed influences here – Blur! Oasis! the Bee Gees! Iggy Pop! PJ Harvey! – it’s to her credit that it still sounds very much like Jade Bird, though notably rockier. There’s a heaviness of guitar and intent that suits her well, from the dirty, chunky riffs and raw howl of Open Up the Heavens to the Sladey stomp of Honeymoon. Her softer shades are just as beguiling: Punchline leans in to the expansive class of Nashville’s session musicians (the album was recorded at the storied RCA studios), a rich country-rock short story flashing images such as “a wedding band, thrown out the window of a black sedan”, while Red White and Blue is a delicately killer acoustic ballad.

                    <span>Royal Albert Hall, London
Bach and Mozart on a modern grand seemed bizarrely anachronistic, although two encores showcased the Icelandic pianist Víkingur Ólafsson at his best
The Philharmonia’s Prom should have been the first to be conducted by its newly installed principal conductor, Santtu-Matias Rouvali. In the event Rouvali could not travel to London, and his place was taken by Paavo Järvi, who also took over the programme unchanged, and with it the much-anticipated appearance of another Proms debutant, the Icelandic pianist Víkingur Ólafsson, in concertos by Bach and Mozart.
It was Ólafsson’s crisp, clean solo disc of Bach that first brought him international acclaim, as well as a fistful of recording awards, three years ago, and there were certainly flashes of the musicality, immaculate technique and limpid tone that won him so many admirers in this performance of the F minor Keyboard Concerto BWV 1056. Yet, played on a modern concert grand with Järvi and the strings of a symphony orchestra chugging along in its wake, it all seemed bizarrely anachronistic, as if conjuring up the spirits of Myra Hess and Henry Wood and the Proms of the 1930s.

Prayers have been said across Plymouth for the victims of last week’s mass shooting as the city continued to be engulfed by feelings of shock, grief and anger.
At St Thomas church in Keyham, a modest redbrick building close to the scene of the shooting, parishioners were asked to pray for the gunman, Jake Davison, and the five people he killed.

Coronavirus – latest updates

It was not only audiences that turned to video games during the pandemic. With theatres closed, and TV and film production on hiatus, British actors chose work they could do from isolation – and the booming gaming industry was ready to fill the gap.
“The minute the pandemic hit, it was just everyone asking me: ‘What mic should I get? How do you set up a home studio?’” says Cassie Layton, an actor and musician from south-west London. “I was lucky in that I had worked doing voice acting for a few years before the pandemic hit. But every single actor, I think, either had the thought or took the action to set up a home studio.”

The decision to extend the measure restricting entry to customers who can prove they have been vaccinated, have had a negative Covid test or have recovered from coronavirus was made by local officials.

                    <span>Former Great British Menu champion James Cochran delivers five summery dishes, each one zinging with flavour and perfect for serving outside
James Cochran has never been happier. A wildly inventive and ambitious cook, he trained for almost a decadeunder the chef Brett Graham, first at the Ledbury and then the Michelin-starred Harwood Arms. In 2018, on his first appearance, he won the ultimate prize on the BBC’s Great British Menu: the champion of champions. And experience, he thinks, has taught him restraint at his Islington restaurant 12:51. “I used to have 23 dishes on the menu, and it was intense,” says Cochran. “Covid maybe opened my eyes and made me think, ‘I put myself under so much pressure’. Now it’s just a dream.”
There’s good news for the rest of us, too: Cochran has supplied five summer recipes for OFM. Raised in Whitstable, Kent, by a mum from St Vincent and a Scottish dad, he wanted to pick dishes that nodded to his background. But mainly he chose food that would be fun to eat outdoors on a sunny day. “We’ve all been cooped up for so long,” says Cochran. “And I just think they’re great elements that can be taken to the beach, or to the park, or in your back gardenanywhere now we can have friends round. With my style of food, it’s important it packs a lot of flavour and you can look across the board and there’s a lot of punchy flavours going on. there.”

                    <span>Looking to the new term as a life-changing boundary feels reassuring
There is still a month on the clock until state schools go back in New York, but for plenty of kids in other states in the US – Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee among them – the autumn term started last week. Many school districts in those states have put mask mandates in place, as has New York: in September, when 1 million-plus children in the city go back to school, they will all be required to wear masks. Meanwhile, remote-schooling options in the city have been cancelled for all but immunocompromised children, and the head of the country’s second-biggest teaching union is pushing for mandatory vaccination for teachers. Changes in infection rates notwithstanding, the start of the new school year looks as if it might be as normal as we can hope it to be.
The strange thing about this anticipation is that it falls at a time when many of us are, once again, curtailing our movements because of Covid. For the first time in months, there are two new Covid cases in my apartment building; infection rates in the city and across the US as a whole are up. After what seemed like a spell of premature optimism at the start of summer, everyone has returned to full-on mask-wearing in stores, and often in the street. And whereas prior to vaccination it was easy to tell oneself that children were less at risk than adults, now it’s one’s unvaccinated kids who seem most starkly unprotected. The risks are still very low – according to the American Academy of Paediatrics, only between 0.1% and 1.9% of all Covid cases in children in the US result in hospitalisation. Still, it changes things knowing that, as a vaccinated adult, if you decide to travel or go to an indoor party it’s your kids who may suffer the consequences.

A toddler is playing a tuba in the next room and Carrie Coon apologises in advance if she’s a little distracted. Unexpectedly saddled with childcare duties today, the 40-year-old is keeping one eye on her two children – three-year-old son Haskell and his month-old sibling – while she chats over Zoom from her Chicago home.
The Ohio-born actor is currently enjoying something of a well-earned moment. Best known for TV roles including grieving widow Nora Durst in post-apocalyptic saga The Leftovers and divorced, dogged Minnesota cop Gloria Burgle in the third (and best) season of Fargo, for which she was Emmy nominated, she now stars alongside Jude Law in acclaimed new psychological thriller The Nest. This autumn she also plays one of the leads in the eagerly awaited reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise.

Few dates in economic history classify as turning points but one of them was 15 August 1971 when Richard Nixon went on TV to announce that the US would no longer exchange dollars held by foreign governments for gold.
Nixon’s announcement 50 years ago this week had lasting ramifications. It was a statement to the world that the US was too weak to continue anchoring the global monetary system as it had done for the past quarter of a century. It would remain the world’s biggest and most important economy, but the days when it was uniquely dominant were at an end.

                    <span>The artist discusses statue rage, tennis tips from Andy Murray – and teeth
A little way into lunch, Maggi Hambling asks me, fatefully, how brittle the little rectangle of pork crackling that comes with our main course is. Before I have had time properly to answer she has bitten into it and almost immediately is fishing something out of her mouth. She studies a pair of lower front teeth on her palm. “Oh Christ! My ‘Maryland bridge’ – of which I was inordinately proud…”
Hambling responds to this small calamity in the way I imagine she has responded to much larger calamities in the past: she takes a slurp of wine, instinctively reaches for her cigarette packet, and laughs wheezily and long. She tucks her Maryland bridge haphazardly into a pocket. “At least,” she says, “you have your opening line: ‘We enjoyed a very pleasant luncheon during which half of my guest’s fucking teeth fell out…’”

When I was growing up in a small Scottish town, we had a bookshop that was utterly terrifying. The books were housed on high shelves behind counters staffed by intimidating assistants. If you didn’t go in knowing what you wanted, tough. There was no possibility of browsing. If I got a book token for my birthday or a school prize, I’d always pick a title I hadn’t read yet from a favourite author so I knew what to ask for. Chances were, they didn’t have it and it would have to be ordered. Cue pursed lips and a frown.
Honestly, it’s a miracle that I ever managed to amass a book collection at all.

Like for most young Americans growing up, 9/11 was a fairly constant presence, with online videos and TV documentaries, memorials and references to it on the news. I never wanted to ask Mum too much, instead putting the pieces together as I got older. I think I always knew my dad had died that day, but I’ve never felt a hugely emotional reaction. I know the basics of what happened, but there’s nothing I can do about it now.

                    <span>Clare Smyth has three Michelin stars, and cooked for Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Her mission? To make the humble magical
When Clare Smyth first looked round the premises of her restaurant, Core, she had a strong feeling that “the place was full of good times”. Though she did not know the history of the building, that instinct was spot on. Back in 1969 another pioneering woman, Prue Leith, had made her name at 92 Kensington Park Road, in the same knocked-through ground floor of a pair of grand stucco-fronted Victorian terraced houses. When Leith’s had opened, Humphrey Lyttelton, then restaurant critic of Tatler, urged diners to make their way to an unfamiliar part of the capital by any means possible: “If you can rob a bank, or beg or borrow a fortune, go to the seamy end of Notting Hill…” For 25 years, many followed his advice, including several Beatles and Princess Margaret.
Half a century on, this end of Notting Hill is very far from “seamy”. What was 1960s Portobello bohemia for Leith has become grown-up and gentrified – but you still would be advised to consider grand larceny in order to get a table at Core. When I visited the restaurant earlier in the summer, it was the opening week after lockdown – which meant it was also the first week that Smyth, 42, had been able to celebrate with her diners the fact that she had become the only British woman ever to be awarded three Michelin stars for her cooking. Good times, indeed.

The US is in a race against time to ramp up the processing of its former Afghan employees under threat from the Taliban military juggernaut, but critics say the effort is too little and too late for Afghans who responded to western urging to build a more democratic society.
As of Friday, about 1,200 Afghans with special immigration visas (SIVs) had arrived at Fort Lee, Virginia, as part of the evacuation plan Operation Allies Refuge. The group – comprising former military interpreters, other US employees and their families – is a tiny fraction of the 18,000 Afghans known to have applied for SIVs for themselves and their families, who are desperate to leave as the Taliban close in on Kabul.

                    <span>The education secretary has done his best, which isn’t exactly saying much
Watching Gavin Williamson’s media interviews last week, I was suddenly reminded of the 1980s TV show In at the Deep End. Do you remember it? Each week, a likable, self-effacing beta male, merrily projecting an aura of general uselessness, would be thrust into circumstances for which he was unqualified and unsuitable. He’d get a small amount of expert advice but, by the end of the programme, he’d be expected to wing it as, say, a rally driver, snooker player, opera singer, hairdresser or chef. Often, you’d think: “He’s coping pretty well for someone so clueless!”
That’s exactly what I feel about Williamson. He has an engaging manner that might engender confidence under different circumstances – if, for example, he were proposing to valet park your car. “He probably won’t steal it or crash it,” you’d think. And even as education secretary it seems likely he’s benefited from up to an afternoon’s intensive instruction. Then I reckon someone’s given him a useful side of A4 with the main points. To say “He doesn’t know the first thing about being education secretary” would be grossly unfair. It’s possible he knows the first 12 things.

Phil Wang is trying to think of a comedian who isn’t an introvert. When he’s really pondering a subject hard his eyes typically roll upwards, his pupils almost disappearing into his eyelids, like he had written the answer to the riddle on the ceiling above him earlier. Eventually he alights upon one candidate, but doesn’t want to name him in case the comedian would take offence at being called an extrovert.
“Gosh, maybe I can’t think of any,” says the 31-year-old Wang, finally. “Probably I don’t even know what an extrovert is any more. I don’t think extroverts really need comedy, in a way. They don’t need a formalised setup in order to interact with people. That was the main appeal about standup, now I think about it, for me as an awkward teenager: it was a formalised setup for interacting. People had to listen to me. And if they interrupted me, they were being rude. And they should leave.”

Britain’s “archaic” counter-espionage laws have been exposed, say sources, by the arrest of David Smith, 57, a security guard contracted to the Berlin embassy. They say there is little point in bringing him home because the current legislation is too weak to deal with spies acting against British interests.

Coronavirus – latest updates

A Tory donor and his son are facing questions about two private companies they run offering Covid-19 PCR tests for travellers, amid complaints about poor service.
Dr Ashraf Chohan, founder and chair of Conservative Friends of the NHS, which aims to forge ties between politicians and healthcare workers in the private and public sectors, is the sole director of 1Rapid Clinics, a government-approved Covid-19 testing company that some customers have claimed sent results back late, lost samples and refused refunds.

BBC news executives vowed on Saturday night to continue to report from Russia and China despite growing fears that both countries are becoming increasingly difficult to cover.
After a surprise Russian move last week that will force correspondent Sarah Rainsford permanently out of Moscow at the end of the month, a senior figure in BBC news said that Russia’s decision not to renew her visa marks a new low in relations. “Efforts are being made to keep communications open but the feeling is that Sarah is sadly right when she says she doesn’t see Russia changing its mind,” he said.

A million workers are still employed by businesses at risk of closure over the next three months, as the government is poised to withdraw critical Covid support schemes, according to new analysis.
One in 16 firms say that they are now at risk of closure in the next quarter, the study by the LSE’s Programme on Innovation and Diffusion (POID) has found. While it marks a major rise in confidence since the worst depths of the pandemic in January, there are warnings that the risk to so many workers coincides with the planned end of the furlough jobs scheme and a cut to universal credit by £20 a week.

Back in April, Rapaport tweeted screenshots of a private Instagram exchange with the Brooklyn Nets swingman that came after Rapaport criticised one of Durant’s post-game interviews. In it, the 11-time NBA All-Star unleashes a fusillade of profane insults – leaning on homophobic and misogynistic language as hard as he does undersized defenders on the low block – before invoking Rapaport’s wife and challenging him to a fight.

Femicide – the killing of women and girls by men – is once again hidden in plain sight by the government. A new Violence Against Women and Girls strategy announced last month fails to address the worst form of men’s violence against women and girls: their killing. The same omission was made in the two previous strategies. Our End Femicide campaign’s first objective is to “name it”. Six months in to the campaign, our government has failed women and girls at the first hurdle. 
The murder of women in the UK has recently generated hundreds of articles and a mass outpouring of grief and anger. So how come the government has failed to name and identify femicide? If not now, when? What will it take?

Seasoned figures in the toy industry have told the Observer that consumers will face higher prices and greater scarcity on the shelves this Christmas as a result of a “perfect storm” of economic pressures that have disrupted their plans. Despite their best efforts, they warned it was already too late to resolve the bottlenecks in time for this year.

                    <span>Nothing more to say on the statue wars? Events in Newcastle suggest otherwise…
The problem with dishonesty is that you have to remember your most recent falsehoods to at least try to keep your story straight. In their pantomime “war against woke”, the UK’s statue defenders are incapable of remembering what they said just 12 months ago.
Last summer, when the statue of Edward Colston was toppled, those who howled in protest claimed that they were not seeking to defend the reputation of a slave trader – a man complicit in the deaths of 19,000 Africans – but were merely opposed to the destructive way in which the statue had been removed. Toppling statues, or even removing them from public display peacefully, they lectured, entailed “erasing history”.

                    <span>Campaigners pushing to remove Stroud’s 240-year-old figure are accused of trying to erase history by the local Tory MP
Much of Dan Guthrie’s life has been haunted by a disturbing mechanised figure resembling a tethered black slave boy, which is supposed to strike a bell hourly in the centre of Stroud. He first passed the automaton, which is known in clockmaking circles as a jacquemart, on his way to primary school in the 2000s and then secondary school – and now on his daily journey into work in the Cotswold town.
“My eyes lock on to the Blackboy clock every time I turn the corner on to Castle Street,” he explains from his home in Stroud. “The boy has huge red lips and is wearing a golden leaf skirt – and he is weirdly enslaved to the clock mechanism when it’s working. It is an offensive racist relic from the transatlantic slave trade, and the fact that it is still up in Stroud is a mystery to me.”

What’s in your wallet? Do you even know where it is? In March last year I stuck a bank card in my pocket; since then, I’ve pretty much given up on the card, too. For the purposes of this exercise, I found and checked my wallet: there’s a £5 note I accidentally ripped in half years ago, folded up very small, plus 38p. “The £20 I’ve had since I was sent home from work on 27 March 2020,” says one friend, fairly typically. “The same £10 I’ve had in my purse for over a year.” “£10.70 – the last of the £50 I took out at the beginning of first lockdown.”
And when did you last use cash? For me, it was a cucumber plant (£1) two months ago. The plant guy is one of the few hold-outs among the off-grid types at the local “food circle” market – every kale-selling hippy has a sleek contactless terminal. We keep coins for supermarket trolleys, occasional parking, and some window cleaners are wedded to cash. These and tipping – many of us don’t trust big companies to distribute digital tips fairly, with some justification – are the few remaining pockets of semi- consistent cash use among my friends and acquaintances.

                    <span>There’s growing evidence that signals sent from our internal organs to the brain play a major role in regulating emotions and fending off anxiety and depression
If you’re sitting in a safe and comfortable position, close your eyes and try to feel your heart beating in your chest. Can you, without moving your hands to take your pulse, feel each movement and count its rhythm? Or do you struggle to detect anything at all? This simple test is just one way to assess your “interoception” – your brain’s perception of your body’s state, transmitted from receptors on all your internal organs.
Interoception may be less well known than the “outward facing” senses such as sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, but it has enormous consequences for your wellbeing. Scientists have shown that our sensitivity to interoceptive signals can determine our capacity to regulate our emotions, and our subsequent susceptibility to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.

                    <span>To track the ‘incel’ diatribes uttered and read by Jake Davison, murdering women can seem like the logical conclusion to their seething hatred
The hours after a fatal attack on members of the public are harrowing. Confusion reigns, rumours swirl and anxious people try to contact loved ones to make sure they are safe. Last Thursday evening, as reports of gunfire and possible fatalities on a housing estate in Plymouth began to circulate, the question of whether it was a terrorist incident was at the forefront of everyone’s minds. When Devon and Cornwall police announced it was not terrorism-related, I wondered how they could be so sure – and their judgment has been called into question by everything that has emerged since.

At the end of the 60s sci-fi classic, The Day the Earth Caught Fire, the camera pans across the Daily Express case room to a front page proof hanging on a wall. “Earth Saved”, screams the headline. The camera pans. “Earth Doomed”, announces the proof beside it.
The head printer looks baffled. Which page will he be told to select? We never find out, for the film concludes without revealing the fate of our planet whose rotation has been sent spiralling out of control by simultaneous Soviet and US atom bomb tests. All we know is that Earth’s fate hangs in the balance thanks to human stupidity.

Four years ago, Jehad Judah was pleased to be able to afford to buy his family a flat in al-Jalaa, a 14-storey building in downtown Gaza City. The upscale tower block was home to about 700 people as well as lawyers, computer software businesses and journalism bureaus belonging to the Associated Press of the US and Qatar’s Al Jazeera.
The 54-year-old bespectacled civil servant spent the first 30 years of his life living in the jumble of breeze-block housing of a nearby refugee camp. After he met his wife in 2001, the couple moved to Gaza to start a family. The Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the strip which came along a few years later made life in the city hard, but al-Jalaa still offered a decent standard of living, he said.

                    <span>The Dutch photographer’s ​self portrait, from a series documenting every stage of his journey, ​finds him ​returning to a source of childhood happiness
When he was a child, Marvel Harris had always felt joyful in the rain, but in his teenage years he’d forgotten that feeling. In adolescence, Marvel, who is autistic, experienced depression and gender dysphoria which provoked eating disorders and self-harm. In 2017, he embarked on gender transition and documented every stage of that process in a series of self-portraits, which are painful to witness and profoundly affecting. This picture was taken outside Marvel’s parents’ house in the town of Zutphen in the east of the Netherlands. He was recovering from gender affirmation surgery and elated by the fact that he could once again feel the inner childhood joy of a rainstorm.
Marvel, now 25, started taking his self-portraits, he says, because he found it “really difficult to express what was going on in my mind”. At first, the photographs helped him to speak about his feelings with his family. Later, when he shared the pictures with therapists and friends, they encouraged him to put them online, to help others who might recognise themselves in his images. His camera provided an unflinching closeup of his traumas, as well as a tender account of the support he received from those close to him. Marvel, a book of his pictures, is the winner of this year’s Mack first book award.

Editors don’t send their journalists to cover wars because they like misery and carnage. They do so because the readers need to know about the carnage. By the same token, albeit with rather less moral urgency, I didn’t go to the pop-up of the Polo Lounge on the rooftop of London’s Dorchester Hotel because I like watching rich people pay ludicrous prices for cack-handed food that’s a gross insult to good taste, manners and commercial decency. I went because some risible hospitality operations need to be called out. Being positive is all well and good, but that shouldn’t mean absolute shockers get a free pass.

Report: last major Afghan city in the north falls to the Taliban 

 2.06am BST 
The UN’s refugee agency provided this update on Friday. What is particularly worrying about Kabul at the moment is that it is where so many people (120,000 from rural areas) fled to seeking safety in recent months: 
Some 80% of nearly a quarter of a million Afghans forced to flee since the end of May are women and children.
Nearly 400,000 were forced from their homes since the beginning of the year, joining 2.9 million Afghans already internally displaced across the country at the end of 2020.
 2.01am BST 
The sun will begin rising shortly over Kabul (which has been blacked out for the last few hours) and we should start to get a clearer picture of where things stand.

Ordering a takeaway and sitting down with a box set was the height of entertainment for most people during successive coronavirus lockdowns – and this served up bumper sales and profits for a string of food delivery companies.
But now that restaurants, cafes and other hospitality venues have reopened, will consumers lose their taste for ordering and go back to eating out?

Coronavirus – latest updates

See all our coronavirus coverage

Ministers are being pressed to reveal what contingency plans are in place to deal with a future Covid variant that evades current vaccines, amid warnings from scientific advisers that such an outcome could set the battle against the pandemic back a year or more.
Recent papers produced by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have suggested that the arrival of a variant that evades vaccines is a “realistic possibility”. Sage backed continued work on new vaccines that reduce infection and transmission more than current jabs, the creation of more vaccine-production facilities in the UK and lab-based studies to predict evolution of variants.

At least 304 people have died and hundreds are missing after Haiti was struck by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that reduced churches, hotels and homes to rubble, in the latest tragedy to hit a Caribbean nation already mired in profound humanitarian and political crises and still reeling from the recent assassination of its president.
The earthquake on Saturday, which struck the country’s south-west at 8.29am local time, was felt across the Caribbean and rekindled painful memories of the devastating 2010 quake that killed more than 200,000 people. The prime minister, Ariel Henry, has declared a month-long state of emergency.

                    <span>Manchester City manager backed his club’s transfer record on eve of Tottenham game overshadowed by Harry Kane talk
Pep Guardiola is the big spender whose greatest triumphs came on the cheap, even if it may not make him the poster boy for penury. As he cited his cut-price Champions League wins, the impression he gave is that he sees them as part of football’s rich tapestry. Guardiola is set to become the first manager to field a £100m footballer in the Premier League – and if he has his way then Jack Grealish will only possess the status as the division’s record signing for a few weeks.
If Sunday’s game at Tottenham doubles up as a tug of war for Harry Kane’s services, money may form a familiar backdrop. Guardiola can be an alchemist of a coach and an inventive tactician, but he is familiar with the accusation he has become a chequebook manager. English football’s maiden nine-figure buy may be used in the case for the prosecution. Tottenham offered £25m for Grealish in 2018; perhaps Daniel Levy’s reluctance to go higher amounted to a false economy as, three years later, Manchester City paid four times as much for the Aston Villa captain.

Can Newcastle’s manager offer the disenchanted and disengaged any reason for optimism? Does he expect to be greeted by rows of empty seats when Newcastle kick off against West Ham at St James’ Park on Sunday afternoon? Is he aware that a majority of the fans seem unusually pessimistic about this season’s prospects? Bruce’s body language tenses.

Imposing “premature austerity” again will undermine the fight against climate change and stop poorer households going green, one of the world’s leading climate economists has warned the government, amid claims that the Treasury is resisting policies to tackle the crisis.
Nicholas Stern, the author of the seminal 2006 government study into the costs of climate change, said comprehensive programmes were needed to help poorer households make the switch to electric cars and away from gas heating, if the government hoped to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

These are the Siren Kings – a street subculture devoted to the volume and clarity of music, channelled through the unusual vector of emergency-evacuation sirens.

                    <span>Liverpool could bask in an evening of good news and, if they wanted, an agreeable omen from history. At the outset this had the hallmarks of a banana skin but they showed little sign of slipping up against foes clad in yellow. Instead they enjoyed as comfortable an opening assignment as they could have wanted and the upsides did not end there.
It bodes nicely that, for the fifth consecutive year, Mohamed Salah wasted no time in getting off the mark. He also recorded two assists, even if one of them owed mainly to good fortune, but the vicious finish that beat Tim Krul all ends up to guarantee the outcome was ample evidence he is in fine nick. He and Liverpool could have scored more but there was pleasure to be taken at both ends of the pitch.

                    <span>Second Test, day 3: India 364, England 391
Captain’s unbeaten century gives hosts slim lead

For the second successive Saturday and the fifth time this year Joe Root delivered a precious century for England, batting through three intoxicating sessions of Test cricket that both underlined his golden form and, more broadly, why the longest format continues to capture the imagination.
As he walked off at the close, his whites scarcely betraying the toil of nearly nine hours at the crease, Root was 180 not out from 321 balls and receiving handshakes and back slaps from his opponents. The final wicket had just fallen at the other end, Jimmy Anderson bowled by Mohammed Shami, but England had put 391 on the board in response to India’s first innings 364 and a slender lead of 27 had been secured.

A group of cybersleuths have tracked down two men who allegedly attacked  police officer Jeffrey Smith at the US Capitol during the 6 January insurrection, leaving him with injuries that have been linked to his death days later.
In a new complaint, attorney David P Weber – who represents Smith’s widow, Erin – wrote that David Walls-Kaufman and and Taylor F Taranto  appeared to specifically target Smith because his eyes and face were vulnerable.

The leader of the United Party for National Development (UPND), Hakainde Hichilema, had taken an early lead against Lungu on Saturday as results rolled in.

Balmoral: “Located in Royal Deeside,” we learn from the royal family website, this gigantic granite folly is “one of two personal and private residences owned by The Royal Family, unlike the Royal Palaces, that belong to the Crown”. So, other than exceptionally cold, according to Cherie Blair – and described by one royal biographer as “gruesome, ugly and dull” – perfect for any member of that family in need of complete privacy.
As for a royal who might require a personal and private residence in which to avoid, for instance, being served with papers alleging the royal sexual abuse of a trafficked US minor, it’s hard to imagine anywhere better.

Last month ministers committed to criminalising the invasive and unscientific “tests” offered by some private clinics to determine whether someone is a virgin through an examination to see if the hymen is intact.

                    <span>A grisly feast of scary British films is heading our way. Why now? Once seen as ‘video nasties’, many believe they have a positive role to play in a pandemic
The terror begins in the London of 1985 when Enid Baines, a film censor, spots an eerie reflection of her sister’s mysterious disappearance in some frightening footage she must view. Enid, the traumatised character at the centre of the chilling new film Censor, has to unravel the dark riddle as a public row about the impact of hardcore horror is raging.
Censor is just one film among a carmine flood of modern British horror now hitting screens and streaming services. Out in cinemas on 20 August, it has been described as a gory tribute to the “video nasties of the past”. But the film’s Welsh director, Prano Bailey Bond, is also making a timely comment on the strange therapeutic relationship between horror films and their ever-growing audience.

                    <span>The former Channel 4 News broadcaster on writing at 4am, reading Carlo Rovelli and the danger posed by the new wave of fascism that’s on the rise across the world
Paul Mason was born in Lancashire in 1960, the son of a headmistress and a lorry driver. He started his career as a music teacher before becoming a journalist in the early 90s. He joined BBC’s Newsnight as a business editor in 2001 and he later worked for Channel 4 News, jobs that took him to China, Gaza and across Bolivia. In 2016, Mason quit broadcasting to pursue writing full time. His latest book, How to Stop Fascism, draws from his own anti-fascist activism in the 1970s and 80s and explores how a new wave of fascism in the 21st century can be prevented from rising.
What prompted you to write the book at this particular moment?
In September 2019, I was on a peaceful pro-remain rally in Whitehall that got surrounded by quite violent Brexit supporters, who turned out to be Tommy Robinson fans. They were shouting: “Paul Mason, you’re a Marxist… you’re a traitor to our country.” Ten years ago, such people would have been talking about migrants taking our jobs, and now they’re worried about Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. I realised something had changed: rightwing populism has been given intellectual coherence by the thought architecture of fascism. As someone who’s been involved in anti-fascism on and off for four decades, it made me think, I need to go back and relearn what fascism is.

Whether it’s the Académie française taking its Canute-like stance against the waves of English words flowing into the French language, or chefs despairing at the prevalence of the “McDo” and the gastronomic mutant that is the French taco, there’s a widespread tendency in France to cast the French as minnows in the fight against globalisation.
The idea is that this is an essentially Anglo-American process, something which is done to, rather than by, the French, and that must be resisted at all costs. All of which is enough to raise a decidedly Gallic shrug among winemakers everywhere else in the world. When it comes to the modern history of wine, the French are very much the imperialists.

To be honest, it felt a bit unnecessary from Chelsea’s manager. After all, consider the context: the sun was shining on a packed Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were a goal to the good and it was already clear they were far too strong for a mediocre Crystal Palace.

Also, a jar of marmalade, a bottle of apple juice and a loaf of bread. There always is. But everything else – ginger snaps? Black pudding? A Peking duck? – is still, at this point, subject to the kind of moderately wild imagining that has you pushing your foot down just a little harder on the accelerator.
What you’re forgetting, of course, is that welcome baskets are not, in fact, even remotely welcoming. They are passive-aggressive acts, timed to remind you of both your own desperation (“How much did we pay for this, again?”) and of the fact that a “self-catering holiday” is basically a contradiction in terms (true in any year, but never more brutally so than in 2021). The first rule of the welcome basket – congratulations, you’ve arrived! – is that it will not be a basket at all, but a cardboard box or a plastic bag. The second rule is that, though the house is for four people, it will invariably contain only two, or six, of everything: two yoghurts, two scones, six sausages. (You do the maths, as they say.) The welcome basket’s essential message is: please don’t imagine for a minute that you’re going to be able to get away without visiting Tesco tomorrow.

Anyone hoping for a property crash is going to be sorely disappointed. The main element of Rishi Sunak’s stamp duty giveaway may now be in the past and the Delta strain of the virus still ever-present, undermining consumer confidence, yet all the elements are in place for prices to continue moving up.
Without the market having much time to catch its breath, the 7% to 8% increases of the past year will only moderate as the mania for property as an investment marches onwards.

The Patch BBC Radio 4 | BBC Sounds
The Grand Scheme: Snatching Sinatra Wondery 
Forever Is a Long Time PRX
Three very different ways to tell a story this week. First up: The Patch is back on Radio 4. This is a show where a producer-presenter – either Polly Weston or Jolyon Jenkins, both from BBC Bristol – goes to a random UK postcode to dig up an interesting local story. The location is selected by an online postcode generator, the original idea being to break out of the metropolitan media bubble and talk to people who aren’t usually asked to tell their tales.

                    <span>“As a boy, my main interest in nature was finding the tallest tree to climb,” says the British photographer Levon Biss. However, after travelling the world, his curiosity shifted to nature’s most minuscule structures. 
For his photo series The Hidden Beauty of Seeds and Fruits, Biss immersed himself in the collections housed at Edinburgh’s Royal Botanic Garden , sifting through its 3,500 historical specimens.  “I was stunned by the variety of designs that exist to disperse seeds. Some are truly ingenious,” he says, singling out the hairy-stemmed electric shock plant, “an innocent-looking seed pod until an animal (or human) decides to bite!”

The Hidden Beauty of Seeds and Fruits: The Botanical Photography of Levon Biss is at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, until 26 September.

A firefighting plane from Russia crashed on Saturday in a mountainous area in southern Turkey, killing the eight crew members and emergency workers aboard, Russia’s defence ministry said.
The ministry said five Russian and three Turkish citizens were on the amphibious Beriev Be-200, which crashed while trying to land in Turkey’s Adana province. A team to investigate the accident was dispatched to the Kahramanmaras area, Turkish state media said.

Continental Europe has come to the UK – at least when the sun shines. In towns and cities all over the country, alfresco dining has exploded, with thousands of extra outdoor seats being licensed.
Many in the hospitality industry say the move has saved their business from bankruptcy after catastrophic losses during the pandemic. Now, although Covid restrictions have been lifted, the government is considering making outdoor dining a permanent feature rather than a short-term response to a crisis.

It was a chance to display new acquisitions. Manchester United led the way, parading Raphaël Varane on the pitch before kick-off, using a quadruple Champions League winner and a 2018 world champion as proof of their largesse. Leeds produced an idiosyncratic response. Enter Marcelo Bielsa, soon to perch on a new bucket.
Unlike the other United, Bielsa has never been a slave to the transfer market. He believes improvement comes from within, aided by relentless running. Luke Ayling has symbolised it. He was a right-back in the lower half of the Championship when Bielsa inherited him and a scorer of a spectacular goal at Old Trafford on Saturday. When Leeds were briefly level, it served as an endorsement of their manager’s credo.

                    <span>Bright hues abound in the stunning Udine hideaway of the Italian designer.
An Italian oasis to call home is on a lot of people’s wishlists. Few, however, would think to look for it in Udine, the northeastern city in the lesser-known Friuli-Venezia Giulia region – unless you’re Patrizia Moroso, that is.
Despite the Italian design scene revolving around the Lombardy capital of Milano, it was here, 20km from the Slovenian border, that the Italian furniture designer discovered the hideaway she was to make her home 15 years ago. Although she has had a long history with the city by virtue of it being where her parents founded their design company, Moroso, in the 1950s and where she has worked as art director since the 1990s, she discovered her sanctuary quite by chance. “I was pregnant with my third child and my two eldest were crazy, terrible boys! I needed a house with a garden so they could live outside,” recalls Moroso, who was living in an apartment not far away in the historical centre with her husband, the artist Abdou Salam Gaye, and growing brood. “One day, I was out walking with a friend and I looked over a fence and saw a kind of wild paradise full of plants and trees. I tried to find the owner to see if they would sell the place.”

I was born in food. My dad used to say: “We don’t have much money and we don’t have fancy cars, but we always have good food in the fridge and on the table.” My parents would buy fillet steaks, foie gras, oysters, lobster; they love good quality food. Every day we had a three-course meal: starter, main and dessert and cheese before dessert. Every single day.
My parents were nurses in a hospital in Limoges and they talked a lot about work at the dinner table: about patient care and the service that was provided to the patient and how they were making the customer, the patient, feel. And, for me, this informed the way I work in restaurants [as a maître d’hôtel]. It was about organisation, it was about trust, it was aboutefficiency, it was about timing, it was about attention to detail. And it was about quality. I was cradled in it; I was almost brainwashed in a particular way of doing things.

Once upon a time, updates of computer operating systems were of interest only to geeks. No longer – at least in relation to Apple’s operating systems, iOS and Mac OS. You may recall how Version 14.5 of iOS, which required users to opt in to tracking, had the online advertising racketeers in a tizzy while their stout ally, Facebook, stood up for them. Now, the forthcoming version of iOS has libertarians, privacy campaigners and “thin-end-of-the-wedge” worriers in a spin.
It also has busy mainstream journalists struggling to find headline-friendly summaries of what Apple has in store for us. “Apple is prying into iPhones to find sexual predators, but privacy activists worry governments could weaponise the feature” was how the venerable Washington Post initially reported it. This was, to put it politely, a trifle misleading and the first three paragraphs below the headline were, as John Gruber brusquely pointed out, plain wrong.

This unusual US trio of two guitars and drums keep things fierce and simple on their homage to the great Chicago bluesman Hound Dog Taylor
When the young Bruce Iglauer witnessed a performance by Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers in 1971, he created a record label so he could sign them. Iglauer was a 23-year-old blues fanatic and Taylor an unrecorded 54-year-old veteran of the Chicago blues scene, though his music reached back further, to the first stirrings of postwar electrified blues. Half a century on, Iglauer’s Alligator imprint is the world’s premier blues label, while Taylor, who died in 1975, is commemorated by this appealingly unvarnished tribute.
Named after a vintage Gibson amplifier, GA-20 are a trio dedicated to the raucous joys of early Chicago blues, the music of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf and, their favourite, Hound Dog Taylor. They are unapologetic equipment buffs, using only antique instruments, and if you care to know how a rowdy 1950s Chicago jook joint sounded, GA-20 are here to help. With an unusual bass-free lineup of two guitars and drums, they keep things simple and fierce; scything, growling riffs, driving grooves and defiant vocals. Itchy, blistering boogies such as She’s Gone and Let’s Get Funky epitomise their visceral approach, amid a smattering of slower outings. Antique maybe, but a reminder that the blues retain their odd, primal power.

One of the greatest contributors to pollution is such a part of everyday life it is easily overlooked: the fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK’s carbon emissions.
This is why the government plans to ban gas boilers in new-build homes from 2025, a policy which could extend to all new gas boilers in homes from the mid-2030s. Beyond this date, newly installed heating systems would need to be low-carbon or able to be converted to use clean-burning fuel such as hydrogen.

Despite investigating Iraq’s secret arms programme in the back yard of Saddam Hussein, the Observer journalist knew that the following day he would be gone, back to the safety of London.
Farzad never made it to the UK. The picture chronicles his last night of freedom. Within 24 hours he would be imprisoned in solitary confinement. Then he would be starved and beaten, the start of a chain of events that would culminate, amid international furore, with his execution at the behest of Saddam.

 Protesters took to the streets of France for the fifth consecutive Saturday to oppose the country’s pass sanitaire – health pass – now required for everyday activities.
More than 250,000 people were expected at about 200 demonstrations, an increase in the number that officials said had turned out last week. Protesters have accused the government of underestimating the numbers and playing down support.

It comes with a justification based on the menace of “very bad” grey squirrels to Britain’s ecology: “How do we stop grey squirrel[s]?” it asks. “Squirrels eat nuts. Nuts grow on trees… if we remove the trees we stop the grey squirrels,” the submission explains. So “to remove trees we build a big tower. It will also sell for a lot of money because it’s so big.” It ends with a sop to whoever might be troubled by the loss of green space: “It can also have a garden on the roof.” It’s meant to be a joke and, as I say, it won’t win. But it deserves some kind of a prize: as a parody of the bogus arguments whereby towers are allowed to trample over British cities, it’s genius.

The Church of England must not repeat its lack of welcome to the Windrush generation when thousands of Hong Kong Chinese people move to the UK in what could be the largest planned migration for decades, say clergy of Chinese heritage.
Many of those who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s were discouraged from attending or even turned away from Anglican churches. Last year, Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury, spoke of his shame at the C of E’s record of racism.

 Iran says it will impose a six-day-long “general lockdown” in cities across the country after being hit by what it describes as its fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, state media has reported.
The lockdown includes all bazaars, markets and public offices, as well as movie theatres, gyms and restaurants in all Iranian cities. It will begin on Monday and will last through to Saturday.

                    <span>Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London
The grime hero makes an impassioned return to the stage with brass, strings, gospel – and a moshpit making up for lost time
Five singers stand at the lip of the stage, sweet gospel harmonies filling the west London theatre. “Suck your, suck your, suck your mum,” they intone as the crowd hoot and whistle, “Yeah I said it – suck your mum!”
SYM is a track from Kano’s Mercury-nominated 2019 album Hoodies All Summer, just one on which the east Londoner – one of the UK’s most compelling artists, playing live tonight for the first time in 18 months – upends expectation. “Suck your mum” is the most reflex of playground taunts. He gleefully rubs low culture against high, paying tribute to the church and to the schoolyard.

On holiday in Menorca when I was really young, I was told not to jump into the swimming pool alone. But I was impatient, so I dived in solo, aiming for my rubber ring, but fell through the middle. I was going down and down until my dad – who couldn’t swim – jumped in and scooped me up. He’s my hero, and has been for as long as I can remember.
My childhood was like something from a TV drama: there was love and loss, so much heart; we lived in different places. When I was two we swapped Birmingham – where I was born – for south London to build a better life. There was diversity and colour, music and parties; feral kids, barbecued chicken and the sound of reggae music. And then when I was 10 we moved to West Sussex.

Top universities are scrambling to find enough accommodation for thousands of extra students, after record numbers netted the high grades they needed to clinch their offers last week. Some students are being offered halls in other cities or shared rooms, as institutions buy up spare private accommodation.
Students were celebrating on Tuesday as nearly 45% of A-level entries across the UK were awarded an A or A*, despite more than a year of disruption and school closures. But some of the most selective institutions are worried that with only weeks to go until students start arriving, they don’t have enough bedrooms, teaching space, staff or specialist equipment to cope with all their unplanned extra students.

There was a hit song in the 1960s by the Lovin’ Spoonful called Summer in the City all about how the days were hot and gritty, everyone looking half-dead, but the nights passionate and fun, full of sex and dancing. That was certainly my experience of the summer of 1967, an especially hot one when New York became a tropical city full of cruising and drinking, of people sleeping without air conditioners on the cindered roofs of their buildings, sharing wine coolers out of Mason jars, and attending late-night horror movies. In the Village on Sixth Avenue and West Third Street, there was always a pickup basketball game going, the beautiful shirtless bodies slathered in sweat.

Apricots rank pretty high up on my list of favourite stone fruits, and they score extra points when they’ve had some time in the oven to soften and release all of that sweet, slightly sharp nectar. Here, I’ve nestled them in a cake rather than a tart, because it can be a bit of a pain trying to keep pastry chilled in a hot summer kitchen. The camomile, subtle but present, brings such a soothing, floral vibe that just makes me want to hold on to summer for as long as possible.

                    <span>Cambridgeshire: At normal size I can see a beetle below, but what if I am beetle-sized?
Imagine you are shrinking, becoming so small that the grass towers over you. Welcome to the territory … of mini-beasts! Wandering down my garden, I feel the summer sun on my face. I crouch down, watching universes under my feet. At normal size I observe a scuttling beetle, shining like a pool of ink. I see a centipede, its orange legs undulating. Then I go minuscule and see it in greater detail: colossal clacking pincers, armoured body, 80 legs. When I’m taller again, I can see new shoots of plants and, if I look down, a glistening earthworm poking out its head. In miniature, I journey inside an ant’s nest, marvel at its intricate halls and corridors, and wonder at the ants’ teamwork.
I ride on the armoured back of a land crustacean – normally woodlice would be tiny! Among the crèches of young lice, amoebas form slimy strings, and mould creeps over the fallen leaves. Do you know how herbivorous millipedes are different from carnivorous centipedes, or how ants tolerate woodlice because they are nature’s cleaners? How springtails jump, how amoebas are slime moulds and slime moulds amoebas? How miniature mobs move as one? Respect the universe under our feet. It’s perfectly beautiful.
Nathanael, 10

The rap superstar Nicki Minaj and her husband, Kenneth Petty, have been sued by a woman he attempted to rape in 1994 after allegedly harassing her to recant her story.
The woman, now 43, alleged she was attacked at knifepoint as a 16-year-old in Queens, New York City, by Petty. He was arrested on suspicion of rape and pleaded guilty to attempted rape, serving four and a half years in prison.

                    <span>Living and working in the same space has given many couples an unwanted insight into each other’s dirtiest habits. But should we really find them so gross?

“Over lockdown, the soundtrack to my life was email notifications pinging – and people burping and farting,” says Emma, describing the unwavering “bodily expulsions” from her husband and their three children as a constant “21-gun salute”. Before the pandemic, her husband went to the office, her eldest child to school and her two younger ones to nursery, and she had the house to herself to work, think and breathe. Back then, the occasional bodily expulsion seemed comical: “When a kid does a burp at the table, especially if they’re not expecting it, it’s very funny.” But together 24/7, the humour was gone. “Not only was there no headspace, but I was having to put up with everyone just letting it fly. I was trapped in it, as if I was in a barn full of farting, belching animals. It started to make me feel a bit depressed. I thought, what has my life become?”
Emma was not the only one. During the third national lockdown, after the cancellation of Christmas lunches across the UK, Google searches for the following terms hit five-year peaks: “biting nails”, “farting”, “burping”, and “scratching”; June saw the peak of “snot”. We cannot know what provoked such searches to proliferate. But we can investigate what happened to couples when these formerly private explosions, explorations and excavations came out into the open and how different partners reacted. We can ask: what do these experiences teach us about relationships? About what it means to be human?

That’s right, after a month away, I’ve returned, and what a month it’s been. “Say, Hadley, how did you spend your incredible four weeks off work? Did you go sailing through the Balearics? Hire a villa in Tuscany? Go rock diving in Portofino?” asks no one. And the answer, no one, is no, I did not. I spent the entire month sitting right here, at my desk, writing a book about mental illness. Do I know how to carpe the hell outta my diem or what?

Longoria, 65, and her son are homeless and stay in hotels when they can but sometimes are forced to sleep outdoors. A lifelong resident of the city, she shook her head: “A heatwave in Portland. It’s not usually like this.”

Universities are setting up their own vaccination centres in an attempt to make campuses as safe as possible for the autumn term. And with millions of students arriving in September, some universities are already warning freshers that due to government restrictions on nightclubs in England they will not be able to attend big social events unless they are fully vaccinated.
The University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol and Kingston University in south London have already opened campus vaccination centres, and the University of Stirling in Scotland, where those visiting nightclubs must abide by contact-tracing rules, will open a centre to students and the public on Saturday. Other universities, including Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham and Portsmouth have confirmed they are in discussions about setting up vaccination services. These centres will be run and staffed by the NHS, but universities are offering to train up students or university staff to volunteer in them.

Kapoor has been attacked on social media for calling her second son Jehangir, the imperial name of the 17th-century Mughal emperor, which means “conqueror of the world”. Kapoor, a Hindu, and her husband, Saif Ali Khan, a Muslim and also a Bollywood star, have faced abuse for their marriage.

‘World turned upside down’ as boy’s therapy dog stolen

Stalking parks in affluent areas and luring puppies out of gardens with treats are among the methods dog thieves are using, campaigners have said, amid suggestions the government is preparing to clamp down on pet abductions.
Criminals mug dog-walkers for their pets and raid boarding kennels in an effort to steal in-demand breeds, whose price tags have soared during the pandemic. They are also on the look out for pets that have not been neutered or spayed and are capable of breeding.

This row of brick sheds, locked away down overgrown country lanes in Bedfordshire, feels a long way from the glossy boardroom presentations about sustainable aviation. But it was recently the backdrop, in the search for greener flying, to a strange and remarkable scene.
“Anyone passing would have wondered why these people were staring at a pipe and whooping and laughing,” says Bobby Sethi, associate professor of gas turbine combustion at Cranfield University. “But we were almost certainly the only people in the world right then burning anything without producing CO2.”

Leanne was having her fringe cut when she was offered fertility drugs. It was leftover stock from her hairdresser’s treatment and she was giving it to Leanne for free on condition that she dispose of the packaging, as it was labelled with the hairdresser’s name and address. Leanne accepted the drugs – it would save months on NHS waiting lists.
A couple of weeks later, Leanne began taking the hormones that would stimulate her ovaries. There was no doctor overseeing the process, no scan or blood test, so Leanne had no idea whether her body was responding correctly. Instead of medical supervision, she followed the advice of several women in a fertility forum. When the pills gave her vertigo, it was these strangers who advised that she should take them at night “so you sleep through the worst of the side-effects”.

In the sprawling compound of Mullah Omar, the Taliban’s first emir, outside the southern city of Kandahar, curious onlookers were poking through his rooms.
There was the little mosque inside the walls, a camel stable damaged by a US rocket, and a series of bare rooms, some scattered with pages torn from a religious text, one a bedroom hung with a picture of an Alpine scene. Nearby, armed men sat on a strange sculpture of a mountain surrounded by spindly palm trees.

Form lines from sprint handicaps the length of the country converge in the Great St Wilfrid Handicap at Ripon on Saturday, including the well-run Scottish Stewards’ Cup at Hamilton in July won by the subsequent Stewards’ Cup winner, Commanche Falls.
Music Society, Mr Wagyu and Staxton – who were second, third and fourth respectively there – all line up, with Staxton, the winner 12 months ago off a 4lb lower mark, a few pounds better off at the revised weights.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Ministers have launched a review of the misleading costs of Covid travel tests from “cowboy” providers, as the government announced that the price of the NHS official test would fall by a fifth.
Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said UK holidaymakers would benefit from cheaper tests, as the NHS test and trace package for international arrivals will be reduced from £88 to £68 for green or fully vaccinated amber arrivals, and from £170 to £136 for two tests for amber arrivals who are not fully vaccinated.

Nuno: ‘All the decisions are not only based on fitness’

Nuno Espírito Santo has suggested he will factor in the turmoil that Harry Kane is experiencing before deciding whether to name him on Sunday in the squad to face Manchester City – the club that the Tottenham striker is desperate to join.
Kane trained with his Spurs teammates on Friday for the first time in pre-season after a later-than-expected return from a holiday in the Bahamas and Florida (at least from the club’s point of view) and a requirement to quarantine for five days.

                    <span>The anticipation had been building. For generations. Not since 1947 had Brentford hosted a top division match and, when it happened – in the club’s lovely new-ish stadium, which was packed out for the first time – it unfolded exactly how everybody would have dreamed.
There was a blockbusting first-half strike from the wing-back, Sergi Canós, to get the place rocking and, after resolute defending, as Arsenal tried to launch the salvage operation, Brentford eased home when Christian Nørgaard leapt to head the second.

It is an indicator of almost everything that was wrong with the Rachel Nickell murder investigation that I could not, on hearing of a drama being made about the case, remember if anyone had ever been found guilty. But I remembered the name and face of Colin Stagg as clearly as I remembered that of Nickell. He was the lonely oddball who fitted the profile drawn up by forensic psychologist Paul Britton, and whom the police relentlessly pursued as their prime suspect. An undercover female officer, codenamed “Lizzie James”, was sent to befriend Stagg (or entrap him, as was the view of the judge who threw out the case …</span>

The longer lockdown progresses, the more ovals and homes around Sydney resemble makeshift gyms. Some trainers have shifted everything but treadmills and ellipticals outside, while others rely on a few key items to train themselves and others while the gyms are closed.
So what do you need if your gym is shut and you want to keep training? Not much. And what you do need won’t break the bank.

The 75-year-old artist and activist is a storied figure in this part of Australia, now a heartland for alternative health and wellness advocates, and notorious for low immunisation rates. He was also the first person from Nimbin to show up for a Covid-19 vaccine.

It looked like a rope or a question mark – a black scribble on the sand. The creature had washed up on a Northland beach in May and was found by a steely local 11-year-old, who popped it into a bag, took it to his local corner shop and requested a box. The purveyor told him it was a sea snake, so the boy put it in a bucket and took it home. The snake did not survive the trip.
“I didn’t know what to do with it,” the boy told the New Zealand Herald. “I chopped its head off, put it in a bag and threw it out.”

The female cub, named Sparta, was found at the Semyuelyakh River in Russia’s Yakutia region in 2018 and a second lion cub called Boris was found the year before, according to a study published in the Quaternary journal.

The friendship of two female soldiers is the poignant basis of this intense, immersive audio play that takes you on a tour of the local area
When you watch news reports from war zones, you often see civilians going about their daily business even amid the gunfire. Conflicts take place not on designated battlefields, as they did in our school books, but on streets where people live.
With that in mind, it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine Edinburgh’s East Claremont Street, a residential road not far from the centre, as the frontline in some unknown battle. There are vantage points for snipers, alleyways for quick escapes and tenement flats where enemy combatants could be lurking.

A gunman who killed his mother and four passersby, including a three-year-old girl, had his firearms licence revoked in December, but police reinstated it last month after he attended an anger management course.
Police will face an investigation over their dealings with Jake Davison, 22, who expressed sympathy for the “incel” movement and a keen interest in mass shootings. One resident from Plymouth, where the killing spree took place, said Davison’s family had sought treatment for his mental health issues.

Pollutants in smoke billowing from huge wildfires in the west of America have probably caused an increase in Covid-19 infections and deaths across several US states, new research has found.
Last year more than 10m acres of land were torched by wildfires, with five out of the six largest fires ever documented in California occurring within just a few months. The burning trees, shrubs and buildings gave off enormous plumes of smoke containing small particles of soot.

Russia is to expel a senior BBC journalist in Moscow by refusing to extend her accreditation in a move the broadcaster has condemned as a “direct assault on media freedom”.
Sarah Rainsford’s visa is due to expire at the end of August and will not be renewed. The state broadcaster Rossiya-24 first reported the decision on Thursday evening, calling it a response to alleged UK refusals or delays in issuing visas to Russian journalists.

The UN has raised the alarm over widespread, systematic sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), saying there have been reports of armed groups carrying out mass rape.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, said its staff had heard horrific testimonies from forcibly displaced people in south-eastern Tanganyika province.

Ex-model Carré Sutton has filed a lawsuit alleging that Gérald Marie, the French former modeling agency boss, repeatedly raped her at his Paris apartment when she was just 17 years old.
The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, also maintains that Sutton was “trafficked by Marie to other wealthy men around Europe”.

The medic, who in 1994 co-founded the humanitarian organisation Emergency to provide free, quality healthcare for those injured in conflict, died on Friday in France, reports said.

                    <span>People are losing their homes, their freedom and their hope. That should be more of a priority than US credibility
“There’s going to be no circumstance where you’ll see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan,” Joe Biden declared earlier this year, referencing the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war. The Taliban are not yet at the gates of Kabul. But two decades after the US toppled the Islamist militants, it is scrambling to evacuate its nationals, as are its allies. On Wednesday, US officials warned that Afghanistan’s government could fall in as little as 90 days. Since then the Taliban have seized Herat, Kandahar and Lashkar Gah; on Friday they took four more provincial capitals.
Such developments have a momentum of their own. The Taliban have captured more equipment as troops have surrendered, and as others turn tail, fewer see the point or hope in staying on and fighting. As resistance collapses, even the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is seeking to distance the UK from its great ally, describing the Trump-negotiated withdrawal agreement as a mistake and a “rotten deal” which Britain tried to resist. Members of the wealthy Afghan political elite, many of whom prospered by plundering the country, have already departed or will do so with ease. But Afghans have been betrayed not only by their military and politicians, but by the long-term mistakes of the US and its allies and the abrupt and ill-planned rush for the exit.

Ten years ago at Wembley, FC Barcelona won football’s Champions League with a performance that established an absolute hegemony in the world’s most popular sport. As Sir Alex Ferguson conceded, the Catalan team had given his Manchester United side “a hiding”. But Barcelona’s hold on the global imagination has been about more than trophies and victories.
Arguably the most famous football club in the world, Barcelona is owned not by an oligarch but by its members, and run by a democratically elected president. For years, the team’s shirts bore the Unicef logo, rather than the name of a commercial sponsor. On the pitch in the early 2010s, the football reached a level of choral beauty never witnessed before, orchestrated by a trio of diminutive homegrown geniuses: Xavi, Andres Iniesta and, first among equals, Lionel Messi. Cups, ethics, rootedness and aesthetics: Barcelona had it all. “More than a club”, as the well-known slogan has it.

New accounts created to get around social media suspensions

Twitter users banned after the torrent of racist abuse directed at England’s footballers are still posting on the platform, the Guardian has learned.
Fifty-six persistently abusive Twitter users had their accounts permanently suspended on 12 July, the day after the European Championship final, amid a blaze of publicity surrounding hateful messages directed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. Some of these users, or ‘personas’, were observed to have joined in directly with the abuse. Thirty of the persistent offenders have since been found to be posting on the network, often under usernames only slightly altered.

The drug companies Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna are poised to make billions of dollars from Covid-19 booster jabs this autumn, with analysts estimating that sales could rival the $6bn-a-year market for seasonal flu vaccines.
The UK government is expected to announce details of its booster programme in the coming days, based on formal advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, but the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has suggested the over-50s could be offered a dose along with their winter flu jabs.

It is not Alisson’s style to bask in individual glory but when even Neymar Jr is impressed by the goal that defined Liverpool’s fight to the finish last season there is no alternative. The impact of the goalkeeper’s remarkable 95th-minute header at the Hawthorns in May reverberated throughout a long-awaited and emotional return home this summer.
“Everyone I spoke to in Brazil, within two minutes they were always mentioning the goal,” says Alisson, who may be uncomfortable with the acclaim but is acutely aware of what his winner at West Brom meant for Liverpool’s pursuit of Champions League qualification and their confidence for the new Premier League campaign. “Neymar, everybody … they were all so excited about it.

It’s easy to laugh at the anti-vaccine movement, and this week they made it easier still. Hundreds of protesters tried to storm Television Centre in west London, apparently unaware that they were not at the headquarters of the BBC or its news operation – which they blame for brainwashing the British public – but at a building vacated by the corporation eight years ago and which now consists of luxury flats and daytime TV studios. If only they’d done their own research.
Anti-vax firebreather Piers Corbyn was there, of course, unabashed by the recent undercover sting that showed him happy to take £10,000 in cash from what he thought was an AstraZeneca shareholder, while agreeing that he would exempt their product from his rhetorical fire. (Corbyn has since said that the published video is misleading.) “We’ve got to take over these bastards,” he said during this week’s protest, while inside Loose Women were discussing the menopause.

It is the third time Sir Branson, 71, has sold a large tranche of shares in in his space tourism company since it joined the New York stock exchange in 2019. He sold $505m worth in May 2020 and $150m in April this year, taking his total stake sales to almost $1bn. He still holds about 46m shares worth $1.2bn.

Amid the celebrations by students getting their A-level and GCSE results this week, it almost passed without notice that girls had stormed the last bastion of male academic attainment by capturing more top grades in maths than boys in both qualifications.
The twin triumph confirms what has long been known among educationists: in formal learning females outperform males at every level and every age group, from the early years through to Sats, GCSEs, A-levels, university admissions and degree classifications. It happens not only in the UK but in every developed country, with few exceptions.

With Afghan government forces in disarray, and amid reports that the vice-president has fled, the Taliban are heading inexorably towards Kabul. They control more than two-thirds of the country, just as the US plans to pull out its last remaining troops.

At that moment the camera pans up to the sky, and when it fades back to the street, the couple have gone, vanished into thin air. It’s not the only time that Chinese film-maker Zheng Lu Xinyuan, making her feature debut, cuts away from characters at precisely the moment another director would go in for a close-up; it may drive you crackers.
This film is pure slow-burn arthouse, shot in black and white, the format dominated by flashbacks – perfect for a film that drifts along on scraps and dreamlike fragments. It follows aimless 22-year-old Muzi (Jin Jing) who is back in her hometown, Hangzhou, visiting her folks for Chinese new year. Nothing much happens. In an early scene a gay friend asks Muzi to have a baby for him; his parents are desperate for a grandchild. Her boyfriend, a sensitive, shaggy-haired photographer (Zhou Chen), shows up unexpectedly from Beijing. Muzi is also flirting with a local bar owner (Dong Kangning) who clearly rates himself. Her parents have been divorced for years. She smokes cigarettes with her dad (Ye Hongming), an artist and jazz musician. A couple of scenes hint at emotional tensions with her mum (Dan Liu), a woman with the glamour and poise of a 1950s movie star; after a drunken karaoke session, her mum is sick on the street. When Muzi leans down to help, mum roughly shoves her away.

We shouldn’t be giving Covid boosters while millions wait for first dose
See all our coronavirus coverage


Many more people around the world will die of Covid if western political leaders “reject their responsibility to the rest of humanity” by prioritising booster shots for their own populations instead of sharing doses, the head of the Oxford vaccine group has warned.
Writing for the Guardian, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, and Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, say that the scientific and public health case for large-scale boosting has not been made and could have far-reaching consequences in other countries.

The hacker responsible for one of the world’s largest digital coin heists has returned nearly all of their more than $610m (£440m) haul, reportedly saying they did it “for fun” and to expose a vulnerability.
The victim, Poly Network, which until Tuesday’s heist was a little known peer-to-peer cryptocurrency platform, said all of the funds except for $33m-worth of the digital coin Tether, which were frozen earlier in the week, had been transferred to a wallet controlled by both the platform and the hacker.

Prof Alan Finlayson is right to question Labour’s approach to values when it is treated as a hollow exercise in developing “clearer, sharper, more uplifting messaging” (Labour’s preoccupation with ‘values’ is a basic political error, 6 August).
Simply communicating Labour party values is unlikely to win an electoral majority, particularly if it appears as an opportunistic alignment with the perceived values of the electorate. That would indeed amount to abandoning political leadership in the hope of gaining short-term party popularity.

One of Britain’s biggest Pride events has vowed to conduct a “transparent review” of its purpose and finances after being criticised for ending its funding of two community charities while giving its chief executive a £20,000 pay rise.
There was widespread outrage among Manchester’s LGBT community last week when it emerged that Manchester Pride was cutting regular funding for a condom distribution scheme it had supported for 27 years, blaming a drop in income caused by the pandemic.

The increase in medical school places might be causing understandable challenges for universities, but training more doctors is nothing but a positive development for the future of the NHS and our health (Grade inflation forces ministers to pay for extra medical school places, 5 August).
We simply do not have enough doctors, which means poorer quality care, excessive workloads and higher levels of burnout. If we fail to ensure a sustainable supply of doctors, the NHS will struggle to meet future demand and patients will suffer.

It had been raining all day the way an old goat pees, in fits and starts, with bleats of sunshine in between. This was a weekday in July 2007, the magical year I moved to Lagos, and only a few months into the nine-to-five that lured me over. The excitement of waking up every day at 5am and catching a jam-packed danfo bus for the two-hour commute had since curdled in my wannabe-writer’s heart. I was standing at Obalende bus stop that afternoon after work, with no bus in sight for the past 40 minutes and rumours of a citywide gridlock swirling around, when the rain started again, a sun shower, proof, they say, that a lion is being born.
Fare hikes were expected on days of heavy traffic, but this time the fare had tripled. Outraged howls rent the air

Glute abduction Like the crab walk, this works your hips hard by driving your knees outward (known as abduction), but, because the hips are more flexed, you will activate the gluteus maximus in your bottom (the largest muscle in the body) much more. This exercise will support your back, and is great for hip and knee stability, which is especially helpful if you are a runner.

“This is the news! Happy now?” Since The Day Today first aired 27 years ago, with Chris Morris’s anchor posing that provocative question, it has remained the gold standard for parodic current affairs absurdity (as well as a guide for all credible news producers of how not to do their jobs).
The show has enjoyed television immortality. For everyone involved – from co-creators Armando Iannucci and Morris through to Steve Coogan, whose now seminal sports hack Alan Partridge showed his face for the first time here – the show changed everything. This week, the original group – minus Rebecca Front, Peter Baynham and, inevitably, the elusive Morris – get together for a gentle grilling by Kirsty Wark in Radio 4’s The Reunion, to examine the show’s significance.

However, his ambitions have been stymied by his failure to publish a roadmap on how to achieve the cuts, and a vocal group on the right of his party has begun to undermine the target by questioning the high price to consumers – ignoring the costs of inaction.

Bloodcurdling shrieks from Downing Street, where Boris Johnson recently beheld a most enraging sight in his magic mirror (bespoke handcrafted rattan, Soane, price on application). Instead of responding to his daily question “Who is the most popular of all?” by reflecting Johnson’s own smirking visage back at him, the looking-glass has been displaying the image of young Rishi Sunak riding his Peloton bike right up in the prime ministerial grill.
Shortly after Johnson appointed Sunak, his relations with the new chancellor were described as “hand in glove”. Unfortunately, Rishi now seems to have tired of the cavity search. The recent leak of his letter challenging Johnson on Covid travel restrictions has enraged the boss whose entire career has been characterised by exactly this type of posturing disloyalty. Amusingly, it seems the prime minister never even saw the supposedly private letter from his chancellor before it was leaked, with Johnson’s defenders saying it should obviously have been put in his red box. Yet even that feels debatable. Hard to say where the best place to put a document you really need the PM to read is. Tinder? Certainly he is said to swipe left on most work-related things placed in front of him.

                    <span>Part of being a good dad is supporting the child’s mother – you, says Annalisa Barbieri
My partner and I have been together for five years; we have a son. My partner wasn’t supportive during my pregnancy and showed no interest in antenatal appointments or scans. However, as our son has got older, my partner has delighted in being a dad. The problem is, he isn’t very nice to me; he doesn’t care for or respect me.
We live in his house; I pay for everything for our son and food bills; my partner pays his mortgage and house bills. He won’t have a joint account.

                    <span>I was called aggressive for criticising passages in Kate Clanchy’s memoir. But the real problem lies deep in the overwhelmingly white world of publishing
It started with a tweet. Kate Clanchy, author of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me posted on her Twitter account that a reviewer on Goodreads had “made up a racist quote and said it was in my book”. She urged her almost 40,000 followers to flag the review that claimed she had bigoted views on race, class and body image, and had used terms such as “chocolate-coloured skin” and “Jewish noses”. Prominent authors and columnists swooped in to offer support, decrying how Clanchy could possibly be subjected to such inhumane treatment – including the current president of the Society of Authors, Philip Pullman, who declared: “But of all the people and of all the books to have had this happen … It’s hard to stay optimistic about the human race sometimes.”
However, it soon emerged that those terms were, in fact, in the book. Incredulous that antisemitic and anti-Black tropes could have made it into a book published as recently as 2019, I downloaded and read it. I recoiled as a Somali boy is described as having a “narrow skull”, while one Muslim girl is “very butch-looking … with a distinct moustache”, and another “looked brilliant because she has such a strong skull shape”, which sounds more like something a eugenicist might observe than a trusted teacher. There is a troubling exchange where Clanchy is baffled by a boy who, with his jet-black hair and eyes and “fine Ashkenazi nose”, denies Jewish heritage. She draws her own conclusion that his family must not want to remember that they’re only seven generations down from a pogrom. After reading about Cypriot bosoms – on a child – and “flirty hijabs”, I wondered what readers would have felt about a male teacher describing children’s bodies in this way.

On a morning in late July, the visitors – a couple with a child, from mainland Italy – were spotted by a fellow beachgoer filling a plastic bottle with sand. The witness to the act immediately called the police.

Analysts and experts are warning of many years of instability across Africa, possibly leading to wars and political upheavals, as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic deepens across the continent.
Though many of the likely consequences are yet to become evident, recent unrest in southern Africa, increased extremist violence in the Sahel and growing instability in parts of west Africa can all be attributed in part to the outbreak, observers say.

As with most farmers living in the remote towns of the Aspromonte mountain range in Calabria, southern Italy, Nicola Fortugno’s land was his life. The 79-year-old refused to be evacuated when flames engulfed Piraino, a hamlet surrounded by pine forest above the town of Cardeto, on Wednesday. Instead, he stayed at home to try to save his animals and crops. His burnt, lifeless body was found by firefighters.
“I used to see Nicola whenever he came to town to go to the chemist or see the doctor,” said Francesca Crea, owner of the newspaper shop in Cardeto. “His death is very painful as we’re a community of mostly farmers, people who make great sacrifices for a small patch of land – the animals are their treasures.”

The billionaire boss of South Korea’s Samsung empire has been released from prison after serving 18 months of a 30-month sentence for bribing the former president of South Korea Park Geun-hye.
Lee Jae-yong, Samsung’s vice-chair and de facto leader, apologised to the country for his actions upon his release from Seoul detention centre. “I’ve caused much concern for the people. I deeply apologise,” Lee, 53, told reporters on Friday. “I am listening to the concerns, criticisms, worries and high expectations for me. I will work hard.”

Have you been watching GB News? It fascinates me. Whatever you say about the TV channel’s politics; whatever debate you’ve been having about who annoys you the most on there, you have to respect somebody deciding to start a news channel in 2021. It demonstrates just the kind of plucky British spirit that they will surely spend many hours discussing the erosion of, live on air.
One of the latest additions to the channel is comedian and presenter Mark Dolan. I have worked with him a few times and always thought he was nice, and still do. In a recent interview I saw on the channel with Dan Wootton, Dolan made a point that I thought was quite interesting, as it highlighted the challenge of positioning yourself as anti the “woke agenda” or whatever you want to call it.

                    <span>There’s no evidence yet that top-up shots are needed, so let’s help those around the world who urgently need the vaccine

Andrew Pollard is director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford; Seth Berkley is the chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance

Since early 2020, the tragic reality of the pandemic has unfolded, killing millions, disrupting normal social interactions, destabilising economies and plunging the world into uncertainty. Between 4.3 and 11.6 million people have died. Amid this deepening gloom, vaccines have brought hope. Their development is a triumph of science; the manufacture and deployment of 4.4bn doses by a handful of developers is astonishing, joyous. In the UK alone, 87m doses have been administered, saving more than 84,000 lives. Globally, the number of lives saved by vaccines is expected to be in the millions.
So why is there still so much suffering around the world? Thousands of people are still dying of Covid every week. Hospitals are overwhelmed and many countries are in despair, urgently pleading for vaccines because they have virtually none. We are in this position simply because the doses we have are not being distributed first to those who are at highest risk of getting seriously ill or worse yet, dying. The vast majority of people who will die of Covid this year could have been saved if we had got this right. Vaccinating those at risk everywhere is in our self-interest. It may reduce the risk of new variants arising, and will relieve pressure on health systems, open travel, resuscitate the global economy, and raise the international authority of politicians prepared to take such moral leadership.

Motorhomes and caravans have been banned from joining standby queues for ferries to Scottish islands after a tide of anger from islanders about overwhelmed services.
CalMac, the state-owned ferry company, has decided motorhomes, camper vans and caravans will only be allowed on their services if they have a confirmed reservation, in a bid to placate furious islanders.

The South Korean musician’s DIY pop songs shrug off frivolities such as love and sex in favour of bopping through the exhaustion and annoyance of having your brain chemistry work against you. Chuck in some videos featuring handmade wall art in “groovy chick” colourways and a dollop of ironic goofiness and Lee’s “spokesperson of Gen Z” status is pretty much assured. A case in point: when she logged on to Zoom for our interview, she asked: “Will we put this out as a video?” which made me feel ancient (and horrified).

“Your outfit is killing the planet.” That’s the message footwear and clothing company Allbirds is using to raise consumer awareness about the fashion industry’s link to the climate crisis. Figures are debated, but an estimated 10% of annual global carbon emissions originate from the fashion industry.
Since its 2016 launch, Allbirds has been vocal about its aim to produce fashion with a smaller carbon footprint. Each item of clothing displays a carbon emissions score to let customers know the climate impact of their purchase. The company has pledged to halve its products’ carbon footprints by 2025, and cut them to virtually zero by 2030.

                    <span>Even before the western withdrawal and Taliban resurgence, the country was on its knees. A refugee crisis is now inevitable
In recent days, a ferocious wave of fighting has enveloped Afghanistan as the Taliban take more and more territory from the Afghan government. The developing situation makes it extremely difficult to predict how the coming weeks and months will unfold in the country. One thing we do know, however, is that while most media commentary focuses on who has the upper hand militarily, the country inevitably faces a humanitarian catastrophe. Ordinary Afghans are confronted with a triple calamity: dire security, health and economic prospects. These cruel conditions predate the Trump administration’s Doha agreement with the Taliban in February 2020, which began the process of US military withdrawal; they also predate President Biden’s confirmation that full withdrawal will occur by 11 September this year.
Afghanistan entered 2021 already in dire straits, with more than 18 million Afghans – nearly half the population – in humanitarian need. Dwindling international aid, a violent conflict, weak governance and environmental challenges such as droughts have all contributed. The impact of the pandemic last year meant that in January 2021 Afghanistan had the world’s second-highest number of people facing emergency food insecurity.

There’s an old saying in Afghanistan that encapsulates the country’s views on divorce: “A woman only leaves her father’s house in the white bridal clothes, and she can only return in the white shrouds.”
In this deeply conservative and patriarchal society, women who defy convention and seek divorce are often disowned by their families and shunned by Afghan society. Left alone, they have to fight for basic rights, such as renting an apartment, which require the involvement or guarantees of male relatives.

Wrong. People who never get symptoms from Covid are less infectious than people who get symptoms, but they can still have high viral loads and can pass on the virus. And the peak infectiousness in those who do develop symptoms is actually the day or two before they start feeling ill.

                    <span>The popularity of the women’s Hundred has taken everyone by surprise and the record-breaking crowds look like seriously challenging those of women’s football
A few years ago I wrote a piece on “double-header” matches – the phenomenon whereby a women’s match is played directly before a men’s match in an effort to increase crowd sizes for the women. The headline will give you an idea of my view: “Double headers are the future – but they stink”.
When I found out, therefore, that the inaugural edition of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s new competition, the Hundred, would be played almost entirely as double headers, my heart sank. I envisaged the women’s matches relegated to “warm-up” status; press boxes filled with retrograde journalists who only bothered to turn up to cover the men; female players being hurried along by the umpires to make way for the day’s “main event”; crowds who arrived to watch the men. In the 10 years I have been covering women’s cricket, these have all been regular occurrences at double headers in England and around the world.

                    <span>The striking thing is not the bad news, which is not really news for those who have followed the science closely. It’s the report’s insights on possibilities for cautious optimism
The first response many of us have to a cancer diagnosis is terror, horror and the conviction that we’re doomed. For those who haven’t been paying serious ongoing attention to climate chaos, reminders that we are facing catastrophe can bring the same kind of response. But if you’ve been through cancer or been close to people who have, you know that the usual next phase is figuring out what the treatment options are and, in most cases, going all out for them. The good news is going to be that you got approved for a promising new treatment, are responding well, you are in remission, feel healthier, have a good prognosis. That there are things worth doing that make a difference.
Climate change is a nightmare, and this summer’s floods, fires and extreme heat, from China to Siberia to British Columbia, are reminders that the problem is rapidly growing worse. Yet the striking thing about the IPCC report released earlier this month is not the bad news, which is not really news at all for those who have followed the science closely. It’s the clarity about possibilities, which I found hopeful.

Fashion’s latest “it” accessory doesn’t come with a three-figure price tag, and it isn’t sold at exclusive boutiques. In fact, the claw clip can be found in most pharmacies nationwide and costs about £3.
The springed hair grip, with teeth to hold hair in place, is familiar to most women as a way to pin long hair up out of their face. But it isn’t usually perceived as glamorous or as part of a fashion trend. That changed when models including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber started wearing the clip, and after it became the subject of hair tutorials on TikTok.

The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK’s own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian.
A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future.

He has big plans for the gym to be a safe space where young people can rehabilitate and focus on improving their physical and mental health. The Guardian follows Raheel as he mentors the next generation and works with activists from around London to reduce the number of knives on the capital’s streets.

                    <span>Regime looking to shift focus from domestic problems with rhetoric around US-South Korea military drills, say analysts



North Korea’s threat to boost its military capacity to counter hostility from Washington before joint US-South Korea military drills is intended to divert attention from its economic crisis but could lead to a resumption of missile tests, according to analysts.
While there is nothing unusual about North Korean opposition to the summer exercises involving American and South Korean forces, its warning this week that Seoul and Washington faced “greater security threats” comes from a position of weakness not seen since Kim Jong-un came to power a decade ago.

When I was seven, there was something on television about a gay politician. My mum, with great vitriol, said: “That’s disgusting.” I thought, I had better not tell her about my views on the matter because she might reject me. I was too frightened.
I knew I was gay then, but I didn’t come out until I was 30. While I kept my sexuality a secret, music meant a lot to me: it had an allure that I felt certain men also had – but in both cases I couldn’t quite express it.

One of the hard-and-fast rules about dining out, alongside never trying to eat the hot towel or order the wine called “Corkage” because it seems the most reasonably priced, is never to get the chef talking about sustainability. Never. For many, you see, it’s their obsession, and at The Loch &amp; The Tyne in Old Windsor, before you know it, you could be perusing the eco-garden and composting area on a Vélosophy bike made out of recycled Nespresso pods. That said, The Loch &amp; The Tyne is an Adam Handling venture, run by his trusted, longstanding cohorts Steven Kerr and Jonathan McNeil, so if you were to break that rule, this is the place to do it.
Handling’s approach to food waste has always been delicious, luxurious and playful ... we&#x27;re a long way from worthy.

It was a heartbreaking scene. A family get-together on a Sunday morning, not for a leisurely lunch at a traditional Chinese restaurant, but for a tearful farewell at the airport.
Amid the Covid pandemic, Hong Kong airport is quiet except for twice a day, when long queues form at airlines desks for London-bound flights. Friends and families turn out in droves to see them off – grandparents hand out “lucky money” in red envelopes to grandchildren, aunts and uncles joke with children to lighten the otherwise melancholic mood. With tearful eyes, many stop for a final hug and pose for one last photo with their loved ones before passing through the departure gates. The waving continues long after they have disappeared from view.

Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the state of New York, resigned this week after the publication of a report alleging that he sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo denies any wrongdoing but after fighting on for a week announced he would step aside on Tuesday. 
Ed Pilkington, the chief reporter of Guardian US, tells Rachel Humphreys that the move marks the downfall of one of the most powerful figures in the Democratic party. He was instrumental in passing liberal reforms on gay marriage, minimum wage and strengthening laws on sexual harassment. But the release of the report documents another story: of multiple allegations of harassment of women.

Texas Republicans have deputized law enforcement to find House Democrats who have fled the state capitol in order to deny the quorum needed to pass dramatic new voting restrictions. 
Law enforcement has been tasked with bringing in Democrats after the state Supreme Court allowed for their civil arrests. “Earlier today the House Sergeant-at-Arms deputized members of Texas law enforcement to assist in the House’s efforts to compel a quorum. That process will begin in earnest immediately,” said Enrique Marquez, a spokesman for Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan, in a statement.

Belarusian authorities have detained more than 20 people in the latest wave of arrests, continuing their sweeping crackdown on dissent a year after a disputed presidential election, human rights activists say. 
Belarus was rocked by protests which were fuelled by the 9 August 2020 re-election of the authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, to a sixth term in a vote that the opposition and the west rejected as a sham. Lukashenko responded to the demonstrations, the largest of which drew up to 200,000 people, with huge repressions in which more than 35,000 people were arrested and thousands beaten by police.
Belarusian authorities have ramped up the clampdown in recent months, arresting scores of independent journalists, activists and all those deemed not loyal. The Viasna human rights centre said on Thursday that more than 20 people have been detained over the past two days in six cities across the country.

The US and UK are scrambling reinforcements to Kabul to help evacuate their diplomats, soldiers and citizens as well as thousands of Afghans who have worked with them, as the Taliban advance towards the capital.
The Pentagon announced it would send three battalions, about 3,000 soldiers, to Kabul’s international airport within 24 to 48 hours of the announcement on Thursday. The defence department spokesman, John Kirby, said the reinforcements would help the “safe and orderly reduction” of US nationals and Afghans who worked with the Americans and consequently had been granted special immigrant visas.

Despite having gone off the air in 2018, the BBC mockumentary series People Just Do Nothing, centred on the defiantly clueless crew of a west London pirate radio station, has continued to grow a cult audience. So a movie spinoff is well-deserved and much anticipated, even if, like its smalltime protagonists, it is hardly destined for mass appeal.

This is the opening fixture that King Solomon would have chosen for both teams and then declared: “If you cannot agree who should have Harry Kane, then he will play for neither of you.” Having said that, if Kane has anything about him, he should plead with Nuno Espírito Santo to let him play so that he can demonstrate the qualities that might persuade Manchester City to pay Tottenham’s asking price. And Nuno should make a gentleman’s agreement to pick the striker, and then leave him out and go with a side featuring players whom he knows for sure will be with Spurs for the whole season. There would be no better way for Nuno to kick off his reign than by beating the champions without Kane. That must be his aim. To dare is to do. PD

                    <span>Show has been shot in New Zealand so far but filming will move to UK from June 2022
Amazon has made the surprise decision to move production of its $1bn-plus Lord of the Rings series from New Zealand to the UK, rejecting tens of millions of dollars in incentives to shoot the TV show in the same location as the blockbuster films.
Amazon, which four years ago paid $250m to secure the TV rights to JRR Tolkien’s works after founder Jeff Bezos demanded a Game of Thrones-style hit for its streaming service, chose to film the first series in New Zealand after competitive bids from around the world.

                    <span>Infection rate peaked at one in six patients in May 2020, but hospitals are safer now, say researchers

Coronavirus – latest updates

About one in 10 patients were infected with coronavirus while in hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK – and that figure rose to about one in six after the peak of Covid hospital admissions, researchers have found.
However, vaccines, improvements in diagnostics and PPE supply, and an enhanced understanding of the virus have dramatically reduced the risk of catching Covid in hospital settings, they stressed. “Things have changed for the better, enormously,” said Dr Christopher Green, a senior clinical lecturer &amp; consultant physician in infectious diseases at the University of Birmingham.

                    <span>Two friends ruin a drug dealer’s stash in this funny, surreal US sitcom – then end up having a tremendously daft, series-long caper
From AP Bio to Mr Corman, it seems the disaffected teacher has become a sitcom staple in recent times, and here is Flatbush Misdemeanours (Sky Comedy) with another one. This ramshackle newcomer is based on a 2017 web series created by and starring comedians Kevin Iso and Dan Perlman, who make a seamless transition to television here. Those who like their sitcoms with a bit of oomph may find this too laid-back, but underneath its low-key demeanour lies a fresh and charming series.
We follow childhood best friends Kevin and Dan, reunited as flatmates (if you can call them flatmates – Kevin is crashing on Dan’s couch, and briefly, on his floor) in the Flatbush district of Brooklyn, New York City. Dan is the teacher, presiding over lively teenagers who would mostly rather not be in his classroom, while Kevin is a painter who has recently moved back to the city from New Orleans and is trying to make his way as an artist.

St Johnstone suffered a 5-3 Europa League exit to Galatasaray at McDiarmid Park.
Scotland’s domestic double cup winners had drawn 1-1 with the visitors in the first leg of their Europa League third qualifying round in Istanbul last week but the second leg proved just too much.

Jamie Spears has agreed to step down from his long time role as conservator of his daughter Britney Spears’ estate “when the time is right,” according to court filings.
Jamie Spears’ departure would mark a significant development in the singer’s long fight to be freed from her father’s control. The developments come nearly two months after the singer spoke in court and called for an end to the controversial arrangement that has controlled her life for 13 years, giving her father and others authority over her personal life and career.

Hosts had Tommy Makinson sent off after an hour

10,464 days. 31 years. 34 successive defeats. But all records are there to be broken – and how everyone associated with Castleford Tigers will enjoy this victory, their first in the league at St Helens since 1990 and one that could yet keep their hopes of a first Super League title well and truly alive.
Castleford’s season was sinking without a trace. Defeat at Wembley in the Challenge Cup final, plus seven losses in eight in Super League, left many fearing that Daryl Powell’s final season at his hometown club would end rather meekly, with the Tigers failing to make the play-offs and ending his eight-year spell in charge in somewhat forgettable fashion.

                    <span>The EastEnders actor will be the first deaf person to compete on the BBC series, challenging misconceptions around who can enjoy music and dance
• Rose Ayling-Ellis to be Strictly’s first deaf contestant
Deafness has long been interpreted, incorrectly, as total silence. As such, Deafness and music are also wrongly seen as things which are incompatible with one another. Everyday language such as “tone deaf” doesn’t help, nor does a lack of representation when it comes to deaf people in music and dance. However, Rose Ayling-Ellis may be about to challenge misconceptions on a major scale, as the first deaf contestant on Strictly Come Dancing.
Ayling-Ellis, who plays Frankie Lewis in EastEnders, has said that appearing on the show is: “exciting and a little bit scary … I hope I will do the deaf community proud and break down more barriers.”

GCSE results this year have revealed a widening attainment gap between pupils at selective schools and those from other state schools. In particular the gap affecting disadvantaged children was branded “unforgiveable” by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.
It followed the trend in A-levels this week when pupils at independent schools stretched ahead of their state school counterparts in achieving top grades.

The directors of Vectura finally emerged and spoke late on Thursday: stuff all our previous ethical boasts, we’re happy to see a healthcare company – one that develops inhalers to treat lung diseases, no less – sold to a tobacco giant for the sake of a few extra millions in a a billion pound bid contest.
It wasn’t quite like that, of course. The board, chaired by Bruno Angelici, merely pushed out a statement that muttered about “fiduciary duties” and noted that the Philip Morris 165p-a-share bid represents a “superior price” to the 155p from private equity firm Carlyle. It amounts to the same thing.

                    <span>From Hunt the Sausage to Kate Moss’s prank call game, the funnyman and tabloid fixture made Radio 1 essential listening. It will be all the poorer without him

When Nick Grimshaw was given the Radio 1 breakfast show presenting job in 2012, it wasn’t merely a personnel change – his appointment marked a meaningful generational shift. The previous host, Chris Moyles, was known for his blokey banter and litany of politically incorrect jokes. Grimmy was his decidedly un-laddy replacement, a radio funnyman for a more inclusive age – one where casual bigotry, or even just hurting people’s feelings, was no longer a laugh.
Now, as Grimshaw hangs up his headphones – hot on the heels of fellow Radio 1 stalwart Annie Mac – it’s time to take stock of the youth-oriented entertainment epoch he has helmed for over a decade. While Grimshaw never courted controversy, he certainly wasn’t bland. In fact, his vaguely camp, intensely pally style didn’t sit well with everyone, and his breakfast tenure was plagued by reports of low listening figures. But for those on his wavelength, Grimshaw made Radio 1 seem an unbeatable start to the day for the first time in a lifetime – and the phrase ‘Radio 1 comedy’ no longer a contradiction in terms.

Rahul racks up unbeaten 127 after England choose to bowl

When England left Trent Bridge on Sunday they could at least draw comfort from the great unknown of a washed-out final day. A heavy dose of reality followed at Lord’s, however, with India dominating the opening exchanges of this second Test thanks to a sublime unbeaten century from KL Rahul.
As the two sides walked off the field at 7.21pm, the tourists had progressed to 276 for three from 90 overs and Rahul was indelibly 127 not out from 248 balls. Ollie Robinson struck late on to remove Virat Kohli for 42, while Jimmy Anderson had shrugged off fitness concerns to deliver two wickets. But this was not Joe Root’s vision when he won the toss under leaden skies and elected to bowl.

The deep south state, where only 35.6% of residents are fully vaccinated, is opening a 50-bed field hospital at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) car park with the assistance of the federal government as officials brace for a climbing death toll and ICU units reach capacity.

Fittingly, it was Didier Drogba who confirmed the news that most Chelsea fans had been hoping for. “He’s coming home,” wrote the former Ivory Coast striker at the weekend in a message on social media accompanied by nine blue love hearts.
Almost exactly a decade to the day since a fresh-faced teenager called Romelu Lukaku moved to Stamford Bridge for the first time for an initial £10m, the striker always tipped to follow in the footsteps of his boyhood idol is back in town after completing his transfer from Internazionale for almost 10 times that amount. It seemed inevitable that Lukaku – who has cost a record £289m in cumulative transfer fees – would one day return to the club he has described as “my first love”, despite rejecting the chance under Antonio Conte in 2017, and this time it finally seems to make sense.

Focusing on four survivors of the massacre at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, this stirs the emotions but doesn’t grapple with the most pressing or difficult questions
At a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, a gunman opened fire. After filling the cinema with teargas, he shot at the audience, injuring 70 and killing 12. Shockingly, it is far from being the worst atrocity of its kind in the US.
Kate Barton’s verbatim play for the young Piccolo theatre company focuses on four of the survivors. It traces the buildup to the new Batman movie, the confusion of the mid-screening attack, the horror of the immediate aftermath and the long reckoning that followed.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Children born during the coronavirus pandemic have significantly reduced verbal, motor and overall cognitive performance compared with children born before, a US study suggests.
The first few years of a child’s life are critical to their cognitive development. But with Covid-19 triggering the closure of businesses, nurseries, schools and playgrounds, life for infants changed considerably, with parents stressed and stretched as they tried to balance work and childcare.

The board of the UK asthma inhaler maker Vectura has unanimously recommended that shareholders accept a controversial £1.1bn takeover bid from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, despite warnings from health charities and public health experts.
In a statement to the stock market on Thursday afternoon, the Vectura board said it considered the terms of the final PMI offer “fair and reasonable”.

Reebok was bought for €3.1bn in 2006 in a blockbuster deal designed to help the trainers and clothing company take on rival Nike, but it never returned to its 1980s heyday and Adidas investors demanded action.

Experts say the work not only sheds light on the movements of the giant proboscideans, but adds weight to ideas that climate change or human activity may have contributed to the demise of most of the creatures about 12,000 years ago.

In its latest report, released on Thursday, the Pew Research Center surveyed 10,221 US adults in July in attempts to understand how the American public views the country’s progress towards ensuring equal rights for all Americans, regardless of their ethnic or racial backgrounds.

Una Stubbs: a life in pictures

Bright and bubbly, tart and twinkly, Una Stubbs, who has died aged 84, was a revue regular and a Palladium pantomime principal boy who parlayed her natural song-and-dance talent into a later, diverse career on the classical stage.
In earlier years she was best known as Cliff Richard’s girlfriend in two high-spirited pop musical movies – Summer Holiday (1963) and Wonderful Life (1964) – and as Alf Garnett’s daughter, Rita Rawlins, married to a socialist layabout (Anthony Booth, Cherie Blair’s father and so Tony’s father-in-law), in Johnny Speight’s classic TV series Till Death Us Do Part (1965‑75) and in episodes of its 1980s sequel, In Sickness and in Health.

It borders on smug, devotees telling you that starters can be over a century old, while some of us see sourdough akin to houseplants: a nice idea but ultimately something else to kill. So is a packet of dry yeast a cheat, or the preserve of true home bakers?

There should be no disputing that, if they are true, the sexual abuse allegations made by Virginia Giuffre against Prince Andrew, the Queen’s second son, are serious. Nor can there be any denying that the seriousness, if it is established, would be both personal and also more widely political.
Ms Giuffre alleges that Prince Andrew had sex with her in London in 2001 when she was 17, and was thus still a minor under US (though not English) law, and that the prince knew she had been trafficked by his friend, the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ms Giuffre also claims that Epstein paid her $15,000 for the encounter.

                    <span>They may be smaller and quieter than they once were, but Scotland’s capital has its summer arts events, and even some visitors, back
The Edinburgh festivals are back – but not as we know them. Last year was the first time since their founding in 1947 that the international festival and its restless, noisy sibling, the fringe, were cancelled. The Edinburgh international book festival, in the meantime, went digital, and found an audience online. This year the book festival’s model is hybrid. It has moved from its former digs in Charlotte Square to the Edinburgh College of Art, from where events with a live audience will be streamed. Though capacity for in-person audiences, socially distanced, is relatively small, a big screen outdoors will relay events to those visiting its “village green”, which will be equipped with a bookshop, cafe – and, it is hoped, an actual festival atmosphere.
The international festival has created a number of outdoor venues – shielded from the rain by temporary structures that bear a passing resemblance to polytunnels – in locations such as Edinburgh University’s Old College Quad. Attempting to mount an international festival in a time of international travel restrictions must be considered a logistical nightmare, but that has opened up the chance for more local events and new kinds of collaboration – such as traditional musician Aidan O’Rourke’s meditation on “Little Ireland”, the part of Edinburgh’s Old Town in which he lives, this past year emptied of its usual roving population of tourists. The project will see O’Rourke performing with Irish musicians, and a film made with fellow Edinburgh-dweller, film-maker Mark Cousins.

                    <span>But coffee shop chain will no longer pay for break times as sales struggle to recover from the pandemic
Pret a Manger has rowed back on plans to slash staff bonuses in a partial U-turn on proposed pay cuts after workers threatened strike action.
However, the coffee shop chain has not reversed a decision to cease paying for break times, so that a worker on an eight-hour shift, including a legally required half-hour break, will still see a pay cut of just over 6% a shift v pre-pandemic levels.

Three more British companies have said they are willing to join a group to buy the Welsh semiconductor manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab if the UK government blocks a takeover by a Chinese-owned company on national security grounds.
The technology executive Ron Black said the new companies had come forward after he revealed the existence of a six-member consortium willing to act as a “white knight” if Nexperia’s purchase of the south Wales company fell through.

                    <span>From voter ID rules to restrictions on protest, repressive measures are on the UK government’s post-pandemic agenda
As a bewildered country blinks in the tentative daylight of freedom, after nearly a year and a half of unprecedented restrictions, a wider struggle to restore our sacred freedoms is surely overdue. Despite cynical attempts by some commentators to brand Boris Johnson a “libertarian” – in practice, he is a man who cherishes freedoms only for his own class – his is a nakedly authoritarian government.
It would be unwise to concede this fact to Covid conspiracists, who are as noisy as they are peripheral in public opinion. It is possible to believe, for instance, that an extraordinary national emergency required lockdown, but that implementing it sooner in early 2020 would have suppressed the public health crisis more quickly, meaning restrictions on freedoms would have been shorter lived. The government’s focus on law-breaking during the pandemic – rather than greater financial support for self-isolation or the hiking of a statutory sick pay that remains among the lowest of the rich countries – is further evidence of its authoritarian credentials.

The “shameful” case of a violent 12-year-old boy who was detained in hospital by 15 police officers illustrates the “systemic failings” in England’s care system, according to the body representing all of England’s directors of children’s services.
The boy was physically and chemically restrained in hospital last month. The disruption meant seriously ill children had to be moved to hospitals miles away, because Wigan council could not find a specialised care placement for him in the community, the high court heard.

Ministers, civil service leaders and employers are “wrongheaded” to be trying to make people come back to the office against their will, and should not be standing in the way of progress around working from home, Keir Starmer has said.
Speaking to the Guardian, the Labour leader said it was wrong for people to be forced back into offices when it was the government that had asked them to work from home in the first place, especially if they were being threatened with pay cuts or the loss of London weighting from their salaries.

                    <span>Readers respond to an article by Frances Crook, the outgoing head of the Howard League for Penal Reform, about the need for radical change to the prison system
Frances Crook has been a voice of reason in the charity sector for 35 years (The reform of prisons has been my life’s work, but they are still utterly broken, 10 August). Like her, I have led several charities to make some sense of imprisonment and to help people come back into the community better, not worse. She is right that reform is at the bottom of the agenda for recent governments, irrespective of the fact that it costs us all a lot of money.
How many people know that a year in prison costs about £40,000, somewhat more than private schools? The total cost of the roughly 80,000 prisoners in the system is more than £3bn a year. Budgets have been cut year after year and all but the most basic education projects have largely ceased to exist. I chair the board of a small charity, Sussex Pathways, which provides volunteer key workers who work on a release plan with prison residents on a one-to-one basis for about three months, looking at an individual’s needs including housing, health, addictions, education, family ties, employment and so on. The reduction in the likelihood of reoffending is about 80%, whereas without this support, it’s the exact opposite. It shouldn’t just be down to charities to try to mend some of the most challenging of society’s ills.

A huge thank you for publishing the podcast about baby loss and miscarriage (Today in Focus, 9 August). My husband and I are currently experiencing our third loss, after the stillbirth of our baby boy and a previous miscarriage, and I felt relief to hear a story like mine in a national newspaper.
Despite our losses, we have also been told to keep trying and that there is most likely “no reason”, with normal tests and results, and that our son, who died in the womb at 25 weeks, was perfectly “normal”. The stigma around this conversation has also been a struggle and we often feel isolated among friends who haven’t experienced loss or miscarriage. I remember thinking after my first loss, if this is so common why do I never hear about it? The mental and physical health battles are very real and, because of a lack of understanding on the subject, people are ill-equipped to support and comfort us in this journey.

Yet the 2020 Games – set during the Covid-19 pandemic following one of the most politically tumultuous presidencies in American history – turned out nothing like I could have expected.
We were greeted by smiling volunteers, but just like myself and my fellow athletes they were told to put on a brave face while the International Olympic Committee ran things in the same dismal way it always has.

On its summer break after a blistering first half of the season, Formula One continues to bask in the warm glow of Lewis Hamilton’s and Max Verstappen’s gripping title fight. The pair have a chance to relax now but it is likely neither will be able to completely banish from their minds the consideration of what comes next, who has the edge and the pressing concern of where and when they will resume battle.
F1 has completed 11 races, with Hamilton leading Verstappen by eight points after turning round a deficit that stood at 33 before the British Grand Prix. The sport’s intent is that they should conclude their fight over 12 more races to take the season to 23 – the stated aim at the beginning of the year and a record number in a single campaign.

It’s long been known that independent schools and grammar schools account for an outsize proportion of the top grades, but the switch from formal exams to teacher assessments made necessary by the pandemic this year and last has highlighted the gap dramatically.

Marriages among people over the age of 65 are on the rise, according to the Office for National Statistics, partly due to the increasing popularity of dating sites. With this in mind, we would like to hear your stories of tying the knot.

With red sandstone battlements, a sprung-floor ballroom, and a prized orchestrion organ said to have been made for Queen Victoria, Kinloch Castle on the Inner Hebridean island of Rum was one of the most luxurious private residences of its time upon completion in 1900.
More than a century later, with collapsing chimneys and extensive rot, the “right owner” is now sought for the category A listed building and its extensive grounds – which included a Japanese garden and glasshouses filled with hummingbirds and, briefly, small alligators – after several stalled restoration attempts.

I grew up in Henderson, just outside Las Vegas. When I was eight, we moved to Nephi, this rural town in Utah. So at the same time I was falling in love with music, I was also being introduced to rodeos and farming. I didn’t realise the impact, but now if I hear the right song, I’m instantly transported back to the clouds, woods and mountains of the American west.

In August 2014, after Islamic State (Isis) militants attacked the Sinjar district in northern Iraq, Hogir Hirori realised his calling. Although he had been living in Sweden since 1999, his home town was only about two hours’ drive from Sinjar.
“When Daesh [Isis] attacked, I realised that I could tell these stories in a really specific way,” he says, speaking via video from Stockholm. “I knew the culture and the language, and I’ve been a refugee all my life, so I had the understanding and the insights to do these documentaries very well.” Hirori had trained in media production and worked in Swedish television, but he had never before addressed an international audience. The news coming out of Sinjar changed all that.

With squeezed budgets, British museums are increasingly relying on private patronage, for financial support and donation of artworks. Yet while the former has faced close scrutiny in recent years, the latter have received little attention.
Now Tate faces potential legal action from one donor, Barry Joule, over his disputed claim that the British gallery has not honoured the terms under which he donated 1,200 sketches, photographs and documents from the studio of his late friend, the artist Francis Bacon.

Rich people in every country are overwhelmingly more responsible for global heating than the poor, with SUVs and meat-eating singled out for blame, and the high-carbon basis for future economic growth is also questioned.

Joya, who is from the persecuted Hazara community, felt she faced discrimination because of her ethnicity and sex. “There were so few women journalists in Kabul,” she says. “There would hardly be women reporters covering political events or press conferences even though these stories affect us greatly.”

                    <span>O2 Arena, London
Pop’s longest-serving imaginary band fill the reopened venue with deceptive chaos and the delight of feeling part of something again
“It’s such a joy to be back,” says Gorillaz’s human representative, Damon Albarn, addressing a full and bouncing O2 Arena. “Thousands of people communing together. What a wonderful feeling. Thank you.” The crowd roar as if they haven’t been to a gig in 18 months.
Who’d have thought that pop’s longest-serving imaginary band – as youthfully bony as when they were first drawn by artist Jamie Hewlett in 1998 – would make a little real-life history by being the first act to play the reopened O2 Arena? Gorillaz and the O2 aren’t natural bedfellows, the former being ramshackle punk/dub/hip-hop futurists and the latter London’s most impersonal venue, but the arena is the only place large enough to hold them, in all senses. Outside, a gigantic queue snakes around crash barriers, and that’s just to buy hoodies; inside, every seat is occupied, and the stage itself teems with musicians, special guests and, onscreen, the gurning cartoon Gorillaz: Murdoc, Noodle, Russel and 2D. This is, in every respect, a big show.

                    <span>As in 2011, anti-racist protests are being criminalised – while nothing is done to address injustices for black communities 
Last week marked a decade since an undercover Metropolitan police officer, known only by his codename V53, shot and killed Mark Duggan, an unarmed 29-year-old father, following a “hard stop” on Ferry Lane in Tottenham. The disturbances that ensued constituted the most serious unrest for a generation. In the four nights that followed Duggan’s killing, police recorded a total of 5,175 individual riot-related offences, 300 police officers injured and five people killed. 
Immediately, politicians from all sides were united in condemnation, swiftly foreclosing the possibility of reading the unrest as political. “Criminality pure and simple,” was prime minister David Cameron’s verdict. “The only cause of a crime is a criminal,” stated the then home secretary, Theresa May. The unrest was “not a genuine outlet of political angst, nor a reaction to police conduct”, according to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, but “simply criminality on a devastating scale”. That framing licensed the harshest crackdown on public demonstrations in public memory.

Our latest release on the Guardian Documentary strand is RIP SENI, a film about an event in June 2020 when graffiti reading RIP SENI appeared emblazoned across a public artwork outside the Bethlem royal hospital, a psychiatric hospital in south London. The spray-painted letters drew attention to Olaseni Lewis, a 23-year-old black man who died after being restrained by 11 police officers while in the care of the hospital in 2010. This film follows what happened after the graffiti, as it launches a discussion about race, mental health and injustice in the UK, and the effects on families.
The director, Daisy Ifama, is a film-maker based in south London. She answered some questions about this new short documentary, which she hopes can continue all the conversation threads that came from that graffiti, and exist as a dedication to those who have lost their lives at the hands of the state.

“No one has understood how deeply rooted in music I am because they got distracted by my tits,” Dana Gillespie complains.
Now 72, the singer and songwriter’s curvaceous figure ensured she regularly appeared in both tabloids and films from the 1960s to 80s but, she says, this was a mere sideline: music was always her mission in life, it’s just that the British refuse to take her seriously. In Austria and Germany – where she has enjoyed hit singles and hosted a long-running radio show – they do. Ditto in India, where she records devotional music with leading Indian musicians. But in Britain she is too often been relegated to “lover of” status for her string of flings with the likes of Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Mick Jagger and Michael Caine. “I’m Britain’s best-kept secret,” says Gillespie, and she may well be correct.

                    <span>Wine lists shouldn’t be terrifying but too often they make me feel like a second-class citizen
In matters of wine, I am not Withnail. I do not crave “the finest wines available to humanity”. I merely want something drinkable from the cheap end of the list which won’t get me in trouble with the editor approving my expenses. It is not only about avoiding confrontation. I also hold that, while paddling about in the shallower waters of that list, I should not be made to feel like a second-class citizen. The opening price should be welcoming.
In my latest restaurant review (out on Sunday 15 August) I shine a spotlight on an egregious example of the exact opposite; on wine pricing that will punch the very breath out of any reasonable person. It is, thankfully, an outlier. But it does raise wider questions about the whole approach to wine pricing and more importantly, the entry point. In my reviews I always list the price of the cheapest bottle. You can tell an enormous amount about a restaurant from that one detail. Those which have bottles for around £20 or less are simply more welcoming than those where the cheapest starts at £30. Recently, I’ve noticed a significant increase in the latter. I loved the food at Humble Chicken; the £30 wine entry point, far less so. Ditto the £32 charged at the restaurant Sussex.

                    <span>In 2018, Indian police claimed to have uncovered a shocking plan to bring down the government. But there is mounting evidence that the initial conspiracy was a fiction – and the accused are victims of an elaborate plot
In April 2018, a large group of policemen arrived at the Delhi flat of Rona Wilson, a 47-year-old human rights activist. They had travelled from Pune in the western state of Maharashtra, and appeared, accompanied by Delhi police officials, at Wilson’s single-room flat at 6am. For the next eight hours, they scoured the modest premises, searching the files on Wilson’s laptop and rifling through his books. Annoyed and short of sleep, he asked that they be put back in place after they had been scrutinised. When the police eventually left, they took away Wilson’s Hewlett-Packard laptop, a SanDisk thumb drive and his mobile phone.
Seven weeks later, the police were back at Wilson’s flat, this time to arrest him. He was accused of conspiring to assassinate the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and planning to overthrow the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Evidence of these crimes had allegedly been found on his laptop. Wilson was flown to Pune, charged under India’s anti-terror law and incarcerated. More than three years after the arrest, he remains in prison.

British police have been involved in the case of a British embassy employee arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying for Russia for “a number of months”, the head of Scotland Yard said.
David Smith, a 57-year-old British national, was detained on Tuesday after a joint investigation by British and German authorities. He is understood not to be a diplomat but a private contractor working as a security guard at the Berlin embassy so does not hold diplomatic immunity.

The new British ambassador to Iran has landed himself in hot water by posing alongside his Russian counterpart in chairs sat in by Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in the Soviet embassy at the height of Iran’s subjugation during the second world war.
The Tehran conference held at the embassy in the capital in 1943 is seen as a low point in Iranian independence, and the photograph tweeted by the Russian ambassador has been regarded by some Iranians as a serious misjudgment.

                    <span>Just one drop of perspiration might soon be enough to identify a criminal or diagnose a cancer. But this fast-moving science could also pose a serious threat to civil liberties


When I deposited my index fingerprint on a laboratory slide so that Simona Francese could analyse it, I felt as if I was giving her the password to my body’s secrets. Most forensic scientists examine a fingerprint’s pattern but Francese, a forensic scientist from Sheffield Hallam University, analyses the chemicals left behind in those whirls and swirls. Her aim is to develop techniques that will allow her to extract identifying information about people at a crime scene from the sweaty residues they leave behind.
Fingerprints are inked with sweat, a body fluid that holds revealing information about our health and our vices. Our sweat glands source perspiration from the watery parts of blood, and any chemicals flowing around your circulatory system can, in principle, leak out of your sweat pores.

                    <span>We are told not to worry about breakthrough cases because they are ‘mild’ – but long Covid is anything but mild
On 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped tracking breakthrough infections that did not lead to hospitalization or death. Its rationale was to “​​maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance”, making the continued assumption that non-hospitalized Covid cases are not important but “mild”: without complications, manageable at home, where patients fully recover in two weeks.
I have dealt with persistent symptoms for 17 months – an illness now called “long Covid” – and not collecting data based on this assumption is an enormous mistake, one that has persisted throughout the pandemic and has severe consequences moving forward.

                    <span>The unprecedented A-level and GCSE scores raise challenging questions about how to measure future student cohorts
This week’s GCSE and A-level results confirmed the expectations of many who study education policy: the proportion of students achieving top grades has increased substantially compared to 2019, especially at A-level. Students should be extremely proud of their results, which were achieved under very difficult circumstances. Likewise, teachers have worked hard to make the best assessment they can of their pupils’ performance. But there is no getting around the fact that these results are different – and not directly comparable – with pre-Covid results.
It is right to allow for the fact that students taking GCSEs and A-levels this year and last are at a disadvantage compared with previous cohorts. In-person exams would have been next to impossible in 2020, and those assessed this year have missed significant amounts of schooling.

The 70-year-old photographer’s small plot in his beloved Birmingham is dedicated to root vegetables and fruit, and has been flourishing during lockdown and beyond. This year’s temperamental climate hasn’t hampered things, he says, as he starts taking a mental inventory.
“We have had an abundance of callaloo,” says Burke, referring to the vegetable often used in West Indian cooking. “My sweetcorn is coming up quite nicely. I’ve got some chard, redcurrants, gooseberries and wild rhubarb – that works really well.”

The prime minister Jacinda Ardern laid out the reopening plans at a forum in Wellington on Thursday, 17 months after borders closed in March 2020.

It has been termed “the Great Resignation” and a “turnover tsunami”. But whether it is because of a shift in priorities during the pandemic or simply a desire for a change, many people have left their jobs, or are thinking of leaving. In the US, the department of labour reported a record 4m resignations in April.
A Microsoft survey of more than 30,000 workers worldwide revealed that 41% were considering quitting or changing professions this year, while in the UK and Ireland, research by the HR software company Personio found 38% of respondents were planning to quit in the next six to 12 months.

                    <span>Australia appeared to be a model case for how to control the spread of Covid-19, but the arrival of the Delta variant has changed everything
When Covid-19 first began spreading around the globe in early 2020, Australia responded instantly. It shut its borders and chased down every single reported case. It was a strategy that came to be known as ‘zero Covid’ and it was widely praised as the model response in comparison with countries where health services had buckled under the strain of the virus. 
But in 2021 that has changed. Guardian Australia’s medical editor, Melissa Davey, tells Rachel Humphreys that Covid is no longer under control in Australia. The arrival of the Delta variant has caused havoc in a country that is largely unvaccinated. She says that when concerns over rare bloodclotting issues led to a change in government guidance around the AstraZeneca vaccine, people held out for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was hit by supply problems.

An ardent royalist has bought the topping from a slice of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s wedding cake for £1,850 ($2,565) at auction, more than 40 years after the couple married.
The large piece of cake icing and marzipan base features a detailed, sugared design of the royal coat of arms in gold, red, blue and silver. It was given to Moya Smith, a member of the Queen Mother’s staff, who preserved it with cling film and dated it 29 July 1981.

Brazilian lawmakers have voted to expel the gospel star turned congresswoman Flordelis over her alleged involvement in the murder of the husband with whom she had raised more than 50 children.
In the latest dramatic chapter of a saga that has gripped Brazil, 437 members of Brazil’s 513-member lower house voted to strip the disgraced evangelical celebrity of her mandate as a result of “conduct incompatible with parliamentary decorum”.

Labour has called for the removal of Ben Elliot as Tory chair over a row about him being allegedly lobbied by Bahraini and Saudi diplomats in relation to a Conservative Middle Eastern group set up by one of his clients.
Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, accused Elliot of having been allowed to “blur the lines between private business activities and his public responsibility” in the latest twist of the saga around two competing Tory Middle East groups.

                    <span>Chelsea 1-1 Villarreal (6-5 on pens)
Ziyech opens scoring but ends night with arm in a sling

Talking points can arrive when you least expect them. With a minute remaining of a humdrum, lethargic extra-time that Chelsea and Villarreal could clearly have done without, Thomas Tuchel made his first bold move of the season. Kepa Arrizabalaga, a £71m player named among the substitutes for the Super Cup, stepped forward to replace Edouard Mendy. Tuchel’s strategy was to be fully justified as Kepa, at full stretch to his right, batted away Raúl Albiol’s penalty to claim the trophy for Chelsea. The scale of celebrations from the Champions League winners – and the dejection easily visible among the Villarreal contingent – painted a picture of something that mattered.
Kepa’s contribution, such a belated one, was crucial. And yet it will be a surprise if he plays against Crystal Palace on Saturday. “We needed to do what was good for the team,” shrugged Tuchel. “Kepa has the better percentages at saving penalties.” Data gurus have a lot to answer for.

The two cases, while not officially linked, are at the heart a geopolitical feud between the United States and China, which has left Canada suffering collateral damage.

Fully vaccinated people in England will no longer be legally required to self-isolate upon contact with a positive Covid case from Monday, and will instead be advised to take a PCR test – in a marked shift from rules that have led to more than 14m instructions to stay at home.
Ministers have confirmed that the legal requirement to isolate will be replaced with non-binding advice to take a test for the double-jabbed, as well as those 18 and under. And those who do come into contact with the infected will not be told to isolate while waiting for their results. For people who do test positive, isolation will continue.

Residents in the town of Tisdale, Saskatchewan (population 3,000) watched in astonishment on 31 July as a bright red helicopter descended on the parking lot near the town’s only Dairy Queen, blowing up clouds of dust and debris as it touched down.

Although extremely rare, a blood clot syndrome after the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine carries a high risk of death and can occur in otherwise young and healthy people, UK researchers have found.
In those aged under 50, blood clots occur in around one in 50,000 people who have received the vaccine, data suggests.

The pair were rested at Edgbaston in 2012, West Indies again the opposition, but that match was a dead rubber. The second Test that begins on Thursday at Lord’s, where the sun is set to shine and the series with India is locked at 0-0 after the soggy end at Trent Bridge, sees England staring into a future they have long been agonising over.

“The promise I make to all New Yorkers, right here and right now, I will fight like hell for you every single day, like I’ve always done and always will,” the Democrat who has served as Lieutenant Governor since 2015, but remains an unfamiliar face to many in the city, told a press conference on Wednesday.

Polish MPs have passed a controversial new media ownership law that could lead to the country’s largest remaining independent TV station losing its licence, but at the cost of several key votes that put the government’s longterm future in doubt.
After a night of protests in Warsaw and 80 other towns and cities against the bill, which opponents see as an attempt to silence an often critical broadcaster, the law passed on Wednesday by 228 votes to 216 in the 460-seat lower house.

If this is accepted by the World Meteorological Organisation it will break the previous European record of 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in 1977. The temperature was measured at a monitoring station in Syracuse, Sicily, and confirmed soon after by the island’s meteorological authorities.

                    <span>Minister tipped to replace Gavin Williamson has upset and enthused fellow MPs – and that’s just the Conservatives
If, as reported, Kemi Badenoch is to replace Gavin Williamson as education secretary at the next cabinet reshuffle, it appears there is only a remote chance of her keeping the department quietly ticking over after a disruptive and harrowing period.
While Boris Johnson will be hoping she avoids Williamson’s numerous gaffes, Badenoch has shown no inclination to shy away from controversy during her brief time in parliament and as a relatively junior minister. More than one person told the Guardian she would “cross the road to pick a fight”.

                    <span>To emerge truly victorious the US president will have to win over the right of the Democratic party and push for big, bold change
On Tuesday, 19 Republican senators, including minority leader Mitch McConnell, joined with Democrats to pass Joe Biden’s $550bn infrastructure bill. In a polarised age, this act of bipartisan politics seems miraculous. To vote for the bill, Senate Republicans had to go against the wishes of Donald Trump, who had warned against handing Mr Biden a victory before midterm polls in 2022. They also U-turned on a core Republican principle: that private investment is superior to government intervention.
Yet the Republicans’ vote was rooted in self-interest. Only four will face the voters next year and the spending was popular, even with Republicans. Crucially Mr McConnell had protected the filibuster. Unless Republicans relented, Mr Biden might have done away with legislative tool that preserves the Senate’s 60-vote threshold for legislative success. Instead Mr Biden thanked his opponents for their courage in backing his proposal. This moment represents a test of Biden’s faith that Congress, and democracy, can still work and get things done.

                    <span>Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has urged civilians to join the war against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. The nation needs peace

Ceasefires are normally cause for hope, bringing respite and perhaps even peace, if not a full resolution. In Ethiopia there has been no such relief. Just as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s Nobel peace prize was soon followed by war with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), so it seems that the ceasefire will be succeeded, as many had predicted, by an intensification of the conflict. On Tuesday, Mr Abiy urged all eligible civilians to join the war.
Nine months of conflict have resulted in thousands of deaths, created tens of thousands of refugees, and led to famine conditions for hundreds of thousands. They have seen war crimes committed by all parties, including massacres of civilians and widespread sexual violence; a report by Amnesty International alleges the systematic rape and abuse of women and girls by forces belonging or allied to the Ethiopian government. The prospect of an escalation is truly frightening.

The company, which is returning to the UK more than 20 years after beating a retreat, said it would open up to 10 of the delivery-only kitchens by the end of this year, some of which could be run from trucks.

Those being expelled may have urgent protection needs and risk being sent back to the very dangers they have fled in their countries of origin in Central America without any opportunity to have those needs assessed and addressed, UNHCR said.

Keir Starmer has called on Boris Johnson to sack his education secretary, Gavin Williamson, for failing children during the pandemic and presiding over a “yawning gap” in attainment between private and state school pupils.
Amid rumours that Williamson could be replaced by either the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, or the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, at the next reshuffle, the Labour leader questioned why the education secretary was still in his job after two years of chaotic exam policies.

                    <span>It is a fitting end to a surreal Games; a gilded cage for athletes and observers to reflect on a unique experience
For the past three weeks, I cowered from the summer sun. The temperature during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics rarely dipped below 30C – the blazing heat and oppressive humidity was ever-present. Mercifully, most of the sports I covered were indoors (swimming, track cycling) or in the evening, once the sun had dipped (athletics, hockey). That meant my encounters were typically brief – waiting for a shuttle bus, navigating a maze of security checkpoints.

As a boyhood Barcelona fan and Monaco man Cesc Fàbregas has ample reason to fear the ramifications of Lionel Messi’s seismic shift to Paris Saint-Germain. The ripple effects of Messi’s every move, however, are not lost on a friend and former teammate still processing the astonishing events of the past seven days.
“For France and Ligue 1 this is another dimension,” admits Fàbregas, who was 13 when he first encountered the great Argentinian trialling for Barcelona. Their friendship survives 21 years on.

                    <span>Parents investing in private education will feel pretty satisfied with the grades – but not those who can’t afford to
There’s a line in Edwina Currie’s Diaries, volume two; it’s August 1992 and her luckless daughter has just flunked her A-levels. “Denstone,” Currie writes of the Staffordshire independent school, “has a lot to answer for.” It stuck in my mind at the time because it was rare, then, to hear that viewpoint so baldly expressed, that when you pay for a private school, you’re buying grades, and if those grades don’t materialise, the school has ripped you off.
In 2021, parents investing in private education can feel pretty satisfied with their return: 70% of independently educated pupils got As or A*s, set against 42% at state academies and 39% at comprehensives. In the scramble to explain why affluent kids should outperform their peers to such a degree, I’ve heard the following hypotheses: they work harder; their teachers are better; poorer students didn’t have laptops or quiet spaces to work in the pandemic; there was less face-to-face online teaching in state schools.

                    <span>Readers respond to this year’s exam results and the latest claims of grade inflation
It’s that time of year for a moral panic over examinations, assessments and claims of grade inflation (A-level data shows record grades and biggest gender gap in a decade, 10 August). Underlying this annual soul-searching is a fact that few of us involved in education, let alone politicians, are prepared to acknowledge. We need to recognise, not shamefacedly but honestly, the extent of our limited understanding of school learning. Despite a century or more of research and “measurement”, we still have no firm, reliable or systematic way of assessing young people’s understanding. Our examination technology is crude, partial, inadequate and discriminatory. The mental health of many former students bears witness to that.
The most we can reasonably claim is a largely intuitive and inevitably subjective form of assessment of learning borne out of working closely with our students over a period of time – talking with and observing them on a day-to-day basis. Hence the importance of teacher criteria-referenced assessment and the priority to make it even more effective. This may be uncomfortable to acknowledge, both for some teachers and for most politicians, but it is the reality. This year’s teacher assessed grades should be the start of a much-needed process of development, not an unwelcome interruption of a faulty measurement system which has passed its sell-by date.

                    <span>We must save our essential canopies of magnificent trees, many of which are well over 100 years old, writes Peter Sparks 
It is not only the big, old “forest trees” that are, as George Monbiot writes, the threatened “keystone structures” for our ecology (The gift we should give to the living world? Time, and lots of it, 8 August). Our cities too, and the green spaces within them, are home to essential canopies of magnificent trees, many well over 100 years old, but equally threatened. “Natural capital accounting” and the business bottom line is here also to blame.
One serious example is the longstanding policy of insurance companies to escape the cost of remedial work on properties with subsidence by blaming it on the root systems of long-established trees nearby. They demand felling, and the essential green cover and all the beneficial ecosystems are lost for ever. If the landowner, normally a local authority, is determined to retain its trees then the insurers pursue them for every cost. Few have sufficient resources. The insurance industry needs to realise that such a policy not only destroys the irreplaceable mature greenery of our cities, but also contributes to the extreme weather events that are generating more insurance claims.

                    <span>The 2007 movie that sees Will Smith fend off mutant vampires has been used as a justification not to receive the Covid-19 vaccine
When it comes to the pandemic, plenty of films have had their turn in the spotlight. Contagion was one of them, for contextualising the scale of the virus and teaching everybody what an R number was. So was Jaws, with Amity Island’s safety-denying mayor, Larry Vaughn, serving as an analogue for any authority figure who was skeptical about the concept of lockdown.
To some extent, those films make sense. In times of great uncertainty, we reach for the familiar to guide us. But sometimes that’s a bad idea. Because sometimes what they reach for is the Will Smith movie I Am Legend.

Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the state of New York, has resigned after the publication of a report by the attorney general which documented that he sexually harassed 11 women and his staff retaliated against one of those women who had the temerity to speak out. (Cuomo denies any wrongdoing.)
Some commentators have taken the opportunity to note that not only did he run a toxic workplace, sexually harass staff and violate state and federal laws in his actions, he also has run the state poorly, despite the reputation he developed during the coronavirus pandemic. But, based in part on my experience of having worked in his administration, it would be more accurate to say that Cuomo has run New York poorly because he ran a toxic workplace, sexually harassed staff and violated state and federal laws.

The 27-year-old – who appeared 52 times for Wales in football, was a world champion in kickboxing and also competed in taekwondo before switching to boxing – has yet to decide whether to make the switch to becoming a professional, having previously said she would like to defend her middleweight title at the next Olympics in Paris. But in an interview on Wednesday after she returned home from Tokyo, Price revealed that Matchroom promoter had been in touch.

A stretch of Hadrian’s Wall, believed to be 1,900 years old, has been uncovered in Newcastle city centre during routine work on a water pipe.
The three-metre structure is believed to have been built during the earliest phases of the historic Roman wall, stretching back to around AD120. The discovery was made about 50cm below ground by workers replacing a water main under one of Newcastle’s busiest roads.

On Wednesday, judges said the weight given to a misleading report from Assange’s psychiatric expert that was submitted at the original hearing in January could form part of Washington’s full appeal in October.

Analysis: shocking if not surprising
A social worker’s tale: ‘FaceTime isn’t enough’


A looming crisis of children suffering abuse, neglect and poverty has been exposed, with growing numbers of young people taken into care in some of England’s most deprived communities during the pandemic.
A Guardian investigation into the state of children’s services in the last 18 months has revealed a sharp rise in social services referrals during lockdown, plus spiralling costs for mental health support and a bulging backlog in the family courts, with some councils buckling under the weight of the extra work brought by coronavirus.

The problems faced by England’s children’s services described in the Guardian’s investigation – buckling under the weight of youngsters taken into care and struggling to help vulnerable families in need – are shocking if not surprising. This is a crisis that has been long brewing. The pandemic has made it even more acute.
Three years ago, the Conservative MP and former children’s minister Tim Loughton highlighted the consequences of the “woeful underfunding” of children’s services. He said: “In some places, the pressure … is so acute it is leaving social workers feeling that the only tool available to them to keep a child safe is to remove them from their family.”

                    <span>Covid has amplified many of the problems facing vulnerable children, but the country’s care system was already falling apart

Anne Longfield is the former children’s commissioner for England

Even before Covid arrived, local authority children’s services were struggling to cope as children with more complex and expensive needs have entered the care system. As today’s Guardian investigation reveals, the bandages and sticking plasters that have held a creaking children’s social care system in place are now fraying under the strain of the pandemic, particularly in some of the most deprived parts of England.
The present system cannot financially support children already in its care, never mind those on the verge of crisis who are often not receiving any help at all. Resources are stretched, systems fragmented, and we have an early years system that is patchy and often failing to identify and help struggling families. Too many children start school with developmental problems with speech and language, or live in families with serious but hidden problems around domestic abuse, mental health or addiction. Many are living in poverty, with some even taken into care simply because their family is too poor to look after them – not because they are being abused or harmed.

By this year it had fallen to its lowest ever position, 64th, continuing an annual slide that has left it just below Malawi and Armenia, in 62nd and 63rd, and just above Bhutan and Ivory Coast, with a classification from RSF of “problematic”.

In the email, which has since been made public, the SoA also distances itself from comments made by its president Philip Pullman on Twitter. The His Dark Materials author had defended Clanchy, whose descriptions of children of colour and autistic children in particular, have been widely criticised on Goodreads and Twitter in recent days.

Germany’s highest public prosecutor said the man, identified only as David S, was arrested at his Potsdam apartment at 2.20pm on Tuesday, and his home and embassy workplace were searched.

                    <span>Andrew Green and Eddie Otchere were teenage ravers who turned early-90s jungle into mutant modernism prose. In his foreword to a reissued edition, Sukhdev Sandhu explains its power, alongside photos from the era by Otchere
Andrew Green and Eddie Otchere – AKA Two Fingas and James T Kirk, whose extraordinary collaborative novel Junglist is reissued this month – came of age at a strange, indeterminate time. It was the early 1990s, post-Thatcher and post-Berlin Wall: a period of fudge and inertia, of recession and housing market collapse, of Britain being forced to leave the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Greater London Council had been abolished in 1986 and the city still had no mayor. Tourists were in short supply; bombs – the IRA attacked the Baltic Exchange, Bishopsgate, even Downing Street – were not.
Green and Otchere were from council estates south of the Thames in Vauxhall. The MI5 building had yet to go up in the neighbourhood and it was hard to imagine that the US embassy would one day move there. Where they lived, squatters were common. The fires that often broke out would have caused even more devastation than they did if the high-rise walling wasn’t so stuffed with asbestos. Turning 16, the two teenagers, both creative and independently minded, headed across town to Hammersmith and West London College. There they bonded over a shared love of comics, basketball, kung fu movies. Music, too.

The new and improved Galaxy Z Flip3 folding-screen flip-phone and Z Fold3 folding phone-tablet hybrid were announced on Wednesday during a livestreamed event, alongside a Google watch co-developed in an attempt to take on the dominant Apple Watch – the Galaxy Watch4.

“Due to current developments in the security situation, the interior minister has decided to suspend deportations to Afghanistan for the time being,” tweeted Germany’s interior ministry spokesperson, Steve Alter.

Football’s coming home – and away. After a year and a half of TV games with piped fan noise and the only swearing from the suddenly audible players, the frisson of real away travel is here. Soon will come the excitement of seeing the floodlights of a strange town as you arrive on the train and the despairing chants when your side go 6-0 down with 20 minutes left of: “You’re nothing special, we lose every week!”
Old rituals will have to be remembered. The dress code for an away day is always difficult. Colours under a concealing jacket, perhaps? A long coat marks you out as a soft southerner, a furry parka or cap as an Essex Man. Something blander to blend in is best. Big pockets are useful to conceal anything intellectual such as books. Accessories are important, too. My pal Big Joe once took a copy of Granta and an umbrella to Sunderland, making me wonder if we’d ever get out alive.

                    <span>Salima Mazari, one of only three female district governors in Afghanistan, tells of her motivation to fight the militants
It is early morning in Charkint, in the northern Balkh province of Afghanistan, but a meeting with the governor is already well under way to urgently assess the safety of the 30,000 people she represents. Salima Mazari has been in the job for just over three years, and for her, fighting the Taliban is nothing new, but since July she has been meeting with the commanders of her security forces every day as the Islamist militants’ attacks across the country increase.
As one of only three female district governors in Afghanistan, Mazari has attracted attention simply by being a woman in charge. What sets the 40-year-old apart, particularly amid the recent wave of Taliban violence, is her hands-on military leadership. “Sometimes I’m in the office in Charkint, and other times I have to pick up a gun and join the battle,” she says.

Bolivia’s cholitas luchadoras began wrestling in the early 2000s. The women, indigenous Aymara Indians who have traditionally been marginalised and oppressed, took to Mexican-style lucha libre wrestling for mental and physical health – and to stick two fingers up to a culture where wrestling was strictly a male preserve. For many it was also a means of escaping domestic violence. Their choreographed fights in the ring became a dramatisation of day-to-day struggles, all the while adorned in their traditional dress of layered skirts, petticoats and embroidered shawls. Their name, too, subverts and reclaims a term, cholita, that has often …</span>

Almost 1.2 million people in England are waiting more than six months for essential NHS services such as brain surgery and eye treatment because of the Covid backlog, analysis shows.
The May 2021 figure is almost five times that recorded in the same period in 2019 , before the pandemic hit, and also includes patients requiring gynaecological services.

It’s easy to feel despair reading the stark warnings in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: the window in which warming can be limited to 1.5C is rapidly closing. The forest fires and flooding on our TV screens, and closer to home, are a wake-up call to the realities of a rapidly warming climate.
The IPCC, the UN body responsible for climate science, described the report as a “code red for humanity”, but 30 years of warnings have not brought about action on a meaningful scale.

Electric heat pumps are expected to be a key part of the government’s upcoming plans to make the UK’s homes greener, warmer, and more energy efficient. Around 40% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from our homes, meaning we will need better home insulation and low-carbon alternatives to the traditional gas boiler. But do electric heat pumps keep homes as toasty as fossil fuels? Or are heat pump installers charging a high price for a lukewarm heating option?
We would like to hear from anyone who has installed an air-source heat pump or a ground source heat pump in their home. Does it do the job, or do you long for your old gas boiler? And do you think it’s worth the cost?

At the end of June, Raye smashed through the shiny and carefully controlled veneer that usually surrounds music stars. The British pop singer’s numerous hit singles had made her one of the world’s 200 most popular artists on Spotify, but her label Polydor hadn’t allowed her to make even one album from a four-album record deal she signed back in 2014.
“I’ve done everything they asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week, ask anyone in the music game, they know,” she vented on Twitter. “I’m done being a polite pop star.” Polydor responded saying they were “saddened” to read Raye’s tweets and the two have since parted ways.

No excuses now for Mbappé not to stay, he adds

Even Lionel Messi seemed wowed by the power of Paris Saint-Germain’s new strikeforce, as he described the prospect of combining with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé as “madness”. In scenes very different to his tearful adieu to Barcelona three days earlier, the Argentinian was unveiled by his new club at a press conference at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday while a large and giddy crowd gathered outside to sing hymns of praise.
“The reception from the people of Paris has been amazing, I will try to live up to your expectations,” said Messi, who felt “incredible happiness” at joining a team that he believes can help him win his fifth Champions League and his first since 2015. Asked, in particular, about playing with Neymar and Mbappé, he replied: “It’s madness to be able to work with such great players on a daily basis,” adding that his admiration was not confined to those new teammates, since Sergio Ramos, Georginio Wijnaldum, Achraf Hakimi and Gianluigi Donnarumma have also joined this summer.

Well, perhaps not, but sometimes simple is good, too, especially when eaten hot from the pan, and preferably with your fingers.

                    <span>Ocean plastic has created a unique home for specialised organisms, from animals that travel on it to bacteria that ‘eat’ it
Plastic bottles dominate waste in the ocean, with an estimated 1m of them reaching the sea every minute. The biggest culprit is polyethylene terephthalate (Pet) bottles.
Last month, a study found two bacteria capable of breaking down Pet – or, as the headlines put it, “eating plastic”. Known as Thioclava sp. BHET1 and Bacillus sp. BHET2, the bacteria were isolated in a laboratory – but they were discovered in the ocean.

Only seven people were deported to Jamaica on a Home Office charter plane early on Wednesday morning, at an estimated cost of £43,000 a person, despite 90 being earmarked originally for the flight.
Concerns were raised about the UK’s decision to go ahead with the flight due to opposition from the Jamaican government because of Covid-19 worries. Fears were also expressed about the vulnerability of some of those due to fly because of trafficking indicators and mental health problems.

Obviously look away now if you have ever personally employed me, but: I don’t think I’ve ever done an afternoon’s work in my life. It’s just not really my vibe. I learned a long time ago that most of my focus happens to me in the morning. There’s a fairly juicy period of concentration between 10am and 1pm, but once I’ve been to Pret and picked out an egg sandwich it really is game over for the rest of my day. You’re welcome to email me, of course, and sometimes you will get a reply. If you look at me at my desk, I do a very good pantomime of doing work (a furrowed brow, some frenzied clicking, spinning a pen on my fingers). But fundamentally nothing’s getting done again until tomorrow; 60% of my salaried working life I just spent looking at football forums and browsing eBay. Nobody has ever, ever noticed this about me.
This is because most office jobs aren’t really real.

Ministers have started ordering vaccines for a booster campaign in autumn 2022, with Pfizer reportedly being asked to supply the UK with a further 35m doses.
The government has still not give the final go-ahead for the vaccine booster programme expected this autumn, but it is understood to have placed the order with Pfizer despite the company raising its prices.

Initially, this year’s Friends reunion didn’t exactly offer much in the way of entertainment. There was Justin Bieber dressed as a potato, and there was that meme about Matt LeBlanc looking like someone’s Irish uncle. Apart from that, the whole thing felt like an elaborate attempt to give James Corden even more air time. 
But that was then. Because now that David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston are dating, the Friends reunion has become an important historical document and must be preserved for ever.

They call the Soča the emerald river. To my eyes it’s turquoise, or sometimes a shocking shade of sapphire. Or like crushed crystal, coaxed into flow. Either way, it’s irresistible. Our trail runs by it and, step after step, our heads are made motionless by those blue-green waters.
I’m in Slovenia but I’m not anywhere easily found on a map. Here, at the far east of the Julian Alps, is a land of water and woods. Half the country is forested, but the part we’re walking through is especially remote. Triglav national park is one of Europe’s oldest. In the middle sits the eponymous Triglav, Slovenia’s tallest mountain, spiritual summit of the nation’s fables and myths.

My family and I are deep into our second summer of staycations, and, given that a weekend in a static caravan in Filey now costs more than a month on Mustique, we’re having the proper, stay-at-home kind. But how can you relax when assailed by tedious life admin, dirty laundry and the ominous damp patch on the wall, without a hint of away-from-it-all exoticism to get you in the mood? I have no idea. My usual at-home “downtime” consists of scrolling through Twitter to top up my cortisol levels or staring guiltily at the garden I’m too lazy and clueless to tend. Even my chickens, usually excellent stress-busters, are embroiled in some sort of intractable avian psychodrama. I obviously need help, so I asked some experts, then tested their home relaxation tips, to find out if it really is possible to have a relaxing holiday at home.

David Boies, representing Virginia Giuffre, has said he and his client have tried everything they can to resolve the matter after alleging that the Duke of York had sex with her while she was 17 – knowing she had been trafficked by his former friend, the disgraced former financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Ruinous, eye-watering, crippling, stratospheric, massive. That’s the cost to the UK of beating the climate crisis, according to those who portray getting to net zero emissions as economic suicide that is being thrust on an unwilling population by posh eco-fundamentalists and zealots.
This is not just wrong, it is the exact opposite of reality. The delusions come from those with histories of climate change scepticism and could be dismissed as the latest mutant variant thrown up by the death throes of denial. But they are having a real-world impact, slowing action at the precise moment acceleration is needed.

Not long before Christmas in 2014, Steve Mallen began to worry about the eldest of his three children. Edward, who had just turned 18, was good at everything. A gifted pianist, a talented sportsman and a nurturing big brother, he had secured a place at the University of Cambridge.
Then Edward stopped playing the piano. He became withdrawn and began to eat less and lose sleep. On 22 January 2015, he went to see the family’s GP, near their home in a village outside Cambridge. He revealed that he had suicidal feelings and had begun to self-harm, something he felt too ashamed to share at home. He had no known history of mental health problems.

                    <span>A major UN scientific report has concluded global heating is now irreversible and it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere
A landmark UN climate report has warned that global heating is irreversible and issued its starkest warning that, unless meaningful action is taken to reduce emissions, the world is on course for catastrophic warming. The sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which was published on Monday, says temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C, bringing widespread extreme weather.
The Guardian’s environment editor Damian Carrington tells Michael Safi that the world’s leading politicians now have nowhere to hide if they do not urgently act on the conclusions of the report. As the UK prepares to host the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year, Carrington says the path to limiting global heating to 1.5C is narrowing and commitments need to be backed with action to avert disaster.

See all our coronavirus coverage

Authorities in northern Germany have appealed to thousands of people to get another shot of Covid vaccine after a police investigation found that a Red Cross nurse may have injected them with a saline solution.
The nurse is suspected of injecting salt solution into people’s arms instead of genuine doses at a vaccination centre in Friesland – a rural district near the North Sea coast – in the early spring.

                    <span>Globe Theatre, London
Imaginative directorial tweaks and an expert cast bring out the full effects of a text stuffed with double-meanings, gender-swapped disguises and dextrous language
Post-pandemic theatre in the UK seems to be bringing us a slew of upbeat musical revivals, classics and feelgood fare. Shakespeare’s most merry of romps, abounding with music, love triangles and pleasing silliness, sits squarely among it. Whether these shows mark a collective retreat into comfort viewing and escapism is a moot point. What is clear is that Sean Holmes’s production excels at the job of lifting us up and making us laugh.
Every comic character is clearly drawn and expertly played. A swaggering and sometimes staggering Sir Toby Belch (Nadine Higgin) comes on with a crate of beer. Andrew Aguecheek (George Fouracres) is a fantastic idiot in pastel colours and a cravat. Victoria Elliott’s wise clown, Feste, is whip-smart and nimble, albeit with a too soft singing voice that doesn’t carry above the orchestra. Sophie Russell plays Malvolio as an understated puritan until bursting into his awful comic incarnation in a yellow body-sock. All are genuinely funny with excellent comic timing, and bring out the full effects of a text that is stuffed full of double meanings and dexterous language.

Dallas star led Olympic debutants Slovenia to fourth-place finish

Luka Dončić welcomed all his bosses with the Dallas Mavericks to his home country of Slovenia to watch the young superstar sign the richest contract in club history.
Now that the record rookie supermax extension of $207m (£194.6) is in the books, it’s back to the business of trying to win for a team that hasn’t advanced in the playoffs since winning their only championship 10 years ago.

A Canadian entrepreneur charged in China with spying days after the arrest of a Huawei executive faces a possible verdict on Wednesday, as Beijing steps up pressure ahead of a court ruling on whether to hand over the executive to face US criminal charges.
Michael Spavor, and fellow Canadian Michael Kovrig, were detained in China in what critics labelled “hostage politics” after Meng Wanzhou’s 2018 arrest in connection with possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.

The hours before a controversial Home Office charter flight to Jamaica was due to take off were mired in chaos and confusion as more than a dozen people were removed from the flight after legal challenges.
The original Home Office “long list” for the flight is believed to have had 90 names on it. But the fate of the deportation flight hung in the balance on Tuesday evening as only about one tenth remained on the schedule.

                    <span>Given everything in football is relative, Steven Gerrard has quickly lurched towards territory marked ‘crisis.’ Suffice to say, this was not in the script amid wild title celebrations around Ibrox in May. For the first time in his Rangers tenure, Gerrard has presided over three defeats in a row. This one, as ended Rangers’ dreams of competing in the Champions League once again, was particularly ignominious as arriving against a Malmö side which was formed of just 10 men for the entire second half. Rangers had even taken an early lead through Alfredo Morelos, before the kind of bemusing capitulation as will haunt their manager. Rangers are making catastrophic errors in defence and lack punch in attack, as now punished by Malmö – twice – and Dundee United.
Malmö must celebrate pairings with Scottish opposition. A decade ago, they also defeated Rangers on Champions League qualifying business. They did likewise to Celtic in 2015. In between, they swaggered to a 7-0 win at Hibernian. The stuff of Swede dreams.

Chris Cuomo, a prime time host on CNN, had a question for his brother: “With all of this adulation that you’re getting for doing your job, are you thinking about running for president?”
Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, where polls showed 87% approval for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, insisted he was not. But the question persisted as Cuomo became the most prominent and trusted Democratic voice during a public health crisis that had then US president Donald Trump flailing.

An attorney for the two women said her clients were “vindicated and relieved that Cuomo will no longer be in a position of power over anyone”.

A day that began with England confirming Moeen Ali’s call-up for the second Test against India at Lord’s ended with doubts over one of their premier seam bowlers, Broad slipping while undertaking a light warm-up jog.

“There have been hard moments, many defeats, but the next day you go to training and then there’s another game, another chance,” Lionel Messi said. “Not this time; this time it’s not coming back.” And that was when reality dropped: this is it, it’s over.
There will be more moments like that in the coming months, little reminders, pangs of loss. That will include on Sunday against Real Sociedad, the first time Barcelona begin a season without him since 2005. They did not even get to say goodbye. His last game, his last goal, number 672, came in front of barely 200 people.

                    <span>The FTSE 100 company’s share of the US online sportsbook market in the last quarter was an astonishing 45%
The smartest deal, in hindsight, done in recent years by a FTSE 100 company must be Flutter Entertainment’s purchase in 2018 of a majority stake in FanDuel, a US business running online sports-based fantasy games for prizes. It was a punt that leadership in the fantasy market could be converted into something very big if US rules were liberalised to allow locals to bet on sport for serious dollars in European style.
At the time, Flutter, then called Paddy Power Betfair (which still describes the bulk of the company), viewed the deal as akin to “an option” on US liberalisation, says chief executive Peter Jackson. But the bullish projection has played out in spades. The US supreme court indeed changed the rules and individual US states are opening up. Back in 2018, Flutter paid $158m for its 58% stake in FanDuel and threw in a few US assets it already owned. When it topped up and took its interest to 95% at the end of last year, the additional 37% cost the rather chunkier sum of $4.2bn (£3bn).

The FBI offer on Monday followed a call by some victims’ families and first responders for Joe Biden to stay away from ceremonies marking the 20th anniversary of the attack next month, if the president failed to honour a campaign pledge to lift the secrecy surrounding the multi-agency investigations.

The Viking-inspired branding chosen by Norse Atlantic Airways makes its intentions clear: the new low-cost long-haul carrier wants to conquer like its Norsemen ancestors, although this time by air rather than across the sea in a longboat.
The airline intends to focus on one thing only, offering budget flights from European cities – including Oslo, London and Paris – to North American hubs.

                    <span>Celebrating students deserve immense credit after surviving an educational ordeal
For teenagers who began A-level courses in September 2019, the last 18 months have been an educational ordeal. Schools in England were let down by a government that failed to develop an adequate plan B when classrooms closed. An estimated third of learning time has been lost to the pandemic. Remote lessons exposed damaging inequalities in domestic circumstances, and the quality of provision was patchy. The suspension of formal exams plunged schools into uncharted territory which was hopelessly navigated by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson.
In that dismal context, Tuesday’s outstanding set of A-level results represents an unalloyed triumph. Those in Wales and Northern Ireland were equally impressive. A cohort which has experienced a level of disruption unprecedented since the second world war has emerged with its hopes and dreams intact. A record-breaking 44.3% of entries in England were awarded A* or A in teacher-assessed grades overseen by examination boards. Almost 250,000 18-year-olds have been accepted on to degree courses in the UK, up 17% from last year. Although the country is not out of the Covid woods yet, there are legitimate grounds for these students to believe that their post-pandemic future starts here.

Vectura shareholders are to be asked whether they wish to sell the British asthma inhaler maker to a private equity firm for £958m, or collect £44m more by handing it to big tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The Carlyle Group and PMI’s intense bidding war for Vectura, which was founded by academics at Bath University almost 20 years ago, had been due to be decided by an unusual Takeover Panel-run auction beginning on Wednesday.

                    <span>Close attention to Chinese spying and influence operations is important. It cannot justify racial profiling and the promotion of distrust
Politicians and academics in the US have begun to talk of Researching While Chinese American, in a deliberate echo of the phrase Driving While Black. There is a long, ignoble history of failed espionage cases against such scientists. But the Trump administration stepped things up when it launched the China Initiative, vowing to aggressively pursue the theft of trade secrets and identify researchers who had helped to transfer technology to Beijing.
Though one man was jailed after pleading guilty to making false statements to federal authorities this spring, its first trial has rightly faltered. Anming Hu’s prosecution for fraud, over claims he hid ties to China, ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. One juror later declared that the FBI owed him an apology, after agents admitted they had falsely accused the former University of Tennessee researcher of being a spy. Yet to the shock of academics, Asian American advocacy groups and others, prosecutors plan to retry the Chinese-born Canadian citizen.

The government is coming under pressure to intervene amid concerns that its Covid testing regime for travellers is close to collapse, with thousands failing to be properly tested on their return.
As photos posted online showed drop-off boxes run by Randox, the UK’s largest PCR testing provider, overflowing with unprocessed swabs, growing numbers of returning holidaymakers are reporting that their test kits are failing to arrive, or are taking up to six days to process.

By the time he reached his 60s Isaac Hendley could look back proudly on his life as a shoemaker in 18th century London. But when he looked forward he could only see the shame of being “passed to his parish” since his “bodily infirmities” meant the end of his independence and self-reliance.
After a year of grappling with his physical deterioration and fears that “he should come to want”, Hendley took his own life in 1797. An inquest recorded the state of his mind according to the testimonies of friends and colleagues.

Hamid Noury, 60, listened through a translator as prosecutors in Stockholm district court read out a litany of charges including murder and war crimes, dating from between 30 July and 16 August 1988, when Noury was allegedly assistant to the deputy prosecutor of Gohardasht prison in Karaj, near Tehran.

Supporters are set for a full return to stadiums this weekend, as the English top flight returns. But the sentiment that “football is nothing without the fans” has been matched by a determination, led by players, to stamp out discrimination that persists both online and on the terraces.

The world’s major economies have seen their rapid recovery after easing Covid restrictions begin to run out of steam in the past month as a resurgence in the virus depressed consumer spending, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
There are signs that the recovery in the US and Japan is losing momentum, the OECD said, while parts of Europe and China have slowed as consumers remain reluctant to eat out, visit attractions and shop as they did before the pandemic.

One night, Angus Andrew woke to a blood-curdling scream. Rushing out into the darkness of the bush around his house in a remote part of Australia’s Ku-ring-gai Chase national park, he encountered a giant python attacking a kangaroo. “You could hear the kangaroo trying to breathe, I tried to bash the snake off it but my wife was all ‘nature, nature, you have to let it happen’,” he says. “The roo’s eyes are stuck in my brain – it was visceral.”
Surrounded by menacing beasts, with no roads, shops, sewerage, or running water, isolation characterises the latest in a very long line of homes and workplaces for the sole remaining member of Liars, the alt-rock band Andrew co-founded 20-odd years ago. Though they emerged from the New York scene that also spawned the Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem, Liars perplexingly remain a cult concern.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Reaching herd immunity is “not a possibility” with the current Delta variant, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group has said.
Giving evidence to MPs on Tuesday, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard said the fact that vaccines did not stop the spread of Covid meant reaching the threshold for overall immunity in the population was “mythical”.

The gap between private and state school A-level grades has grown to its widest in the modern era as part of a record-breaking set of results in which black pupils and male pupils also received lower grades than their peers.
After a year of disruption and school closures during the pandemic, nearly 45% of A-level entries across England, Wales and Northern Ireland were awarded top grades of A or A*, up from 38% in 2020 and 25% in 2019.

Etna’s youngest and most active crater has risen to a record of 3,357 metres (11,000ft) above sea level, said the National Institute for Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV), based in the Sicilian city of Catania.

The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Major climate changes inevitable and irreversible – IPCC’s starkest warning yet, 9 August) paints a grim picture, with global temperature rises of 1.5C degrees or more beyond pre-industrial levels predicted unless urgent action is taken in the next few decades. The report contains a lot of detail about what this would look like, but it is summarised by Prof Tim Palmer as “hell on earth”.
With such serious danger to be avoided, you would expect that our government would be taking appropriate action to prevent this. Some of the actions it is taking are promising, but its “jet zero” strategy for flying is madness. Its own Climate Change Committee recommends managing passenger numbers in some way to allow only slow growth of about 0.7% per year from 2018 to 2050, as well as investing in aircraft and fuel technology. The jet zero strategy throws away this carefully planned advice, choosing instead to allow airports and airlines to expand as much as they like and hoping for miraculous improvements in technology.

Carnal claymation characters share exhibition space with lush silk paintings, shocking sculpture and a vast tapestry in which you are an exploding goat
Delights of an Undirected Mind is a group show promisingly centring around dreams, trance states and hallucinations. It  takes its name from a film by Swedish artist duo Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg, which is playing on loop on a small television screen just as you come through the gallery doors.
Djurberg creates brightly coloured clay puppets, with bulging eyes and spindly limbs, which perform in surreal animations set to a soundtrack composed by Berg. The narrative plays out mainly in a child’s bedroom, where a little girl is being put to bed by an elephant in a dressing gown, but it’s when a tiger starts suckling at a cow’s teats that things get really out of hand. In comes a giraffe, a gleaming black octopus, a unicorn, a pair of cucumbers spooning, a mouse caressing a piece of cheese with legs and a crocodile wielding a leather whip. There’s a lot of caressing and writhing around on the bed, and then a can of condensed milk spills its sticky contents all over the sheets. It’s a humorous and hedonistic scene that vividly illuminates the darker undertones of children’s fairytales, but also makes reference to modern-day greed and the hypersexualisation of culture.

After BBC Panorama reported on the sum he made for a part-time job over two and a half years, the former prime minister was urged to divulge what he knew about the company’s financial troubles before it collapsed this year.

There is a case to say England should have left Moeen Ali where he was, merrily blazing a trail of languid destruction for Birmingham Phoenix in the Hundred and furthering his claim to be Eoin Morgan’s No 3 berserker come the T20 World Cup.
After all, the number-crunchers at CricViz tell us no batsman in the history of the shortest international format greets spinners with such unfettered violence and the pitches in the United Arab Emirates this October may well demand such approach when Morgan’s white-ball machine begins its hunt for a second piece of silverware.

Authorities in the two Baltic states and Poland have faced increases in illegal migration so severe they have appealed to Brussels for help, accusing the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, of orchestrating the crossings in a form of “hybrid warfare”.

“I could have worse tags than ‘Air Miles Andy’”, Prince Andrew once remarked, “although I don’t know what they are.” Yeah, well … SPOILERS. I’m not sure if the Duke of York would have better luck if he considered the question again today, in light of Various Events of the past few years. His infamous Newsnight interview revealed him to be a man of such baroque stupidity that in some ways its most sensational revelation was that Prince Edward must have been the clever one.
And so to events overnight in New York. For the first time, the Queen’s second son has been made the subject of a US lawsuit, a civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre, formerly Roberts, teenage victim of Andrew’s former close friend, the late underage sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre alleges that the Queen’s second son sexually abused her when she was a minor on three occasions – in London, in New York, and in the US Virgin Islands. Quite a lot of air miles, there, though I fear we can rule out HRH cashing them in for a free flight to the US any time soon. The prince has not commented on the case but he has always denied the claims saying they’re false and without foundation.

“Babe, look!” my wife said excitedly, as we sprawled on the grass reading on one baking hot afternoon. She passed me her book: “Read this – this person is just like you!” I read the paragraph she was pointing to. A clearly distraught character was fulminating about poorly designed roundabouts; she kept going on and on and on about them. To be clear, I don’t have any opinions about roundabouts. Not a single one. I curtly informed my wife of this. “Yeah,” she said. “But you do have, you know, certain rants you keep coming back to. Like, incessantly.”
I couldn’t argue. While I have always been a committed pessimist, recently I’ve gone into full-blown Chicken Little mode with existential obsessions. I’ll wake up, look at the latest terrifying news on my phone and immediately launch a diatribe about how we are almost certainly going to experience climate emergency-induced societal collapse in our lifetimes. “Have you seen what’s happening in Greece/northern California/Turkey?” I’ll screech. “Have you seen how many billionaires are fleeing to New Zealand to avoid the imminent apocalypse? The weather is out of control! Joe Biden and his woefully inadequate infrastructure bill aren’t going to fix anything! We are all doomed! DOOMED!”

Most of us are everyday citizens, rather than global decision-makers, and making small changes while governments continue to invest in fossil fuels and delay making policy changes that would reduce emissions can feel … not enough.
However, there are plenty of impactful things individuals can do to help tackle the crisis.

                    <span>Following the unequivocal IPCC climate report, we must all put pressure on governments to end the fossil fuel era
The sixth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is no ordinary publication. Its 4,000 pages were written by hundreds of independent scientists from 66 countries. It was commissioned by 195 governments and all of them signed off on the conclusions after reviewing them line by line and word by word. These governments, whether supportive, ambivalent or hostile to climate action, now own the messages in the report. So what does it say?
The report concludes that there is now “unequivocal” evidence that human actions are changing our climate. Behind this are alarming findings. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has led to levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that are higher today than at any time in the past 2 million years. Alongside methane and other greenhouse gases, this has driven Earth to be warmer than at any point in the past 125,000 years. The impacts of this can be seen in the loss of Arctic sea ice, accelerating sea level rise, hotter and more frequent heatwaves, increased and more frequent extreme rainfall events and, in some regions, more intense droughts and fires.

In scenes more resonant of war, trained firefighters backed by a ragtag army of local people waged a “superhuman” battle overnight to extinguish wind-whipped blazes raging for an eighth day on the Greek island of Evia.
With yet another village ordered to be evacuated on Tuesday, a multinational force of nearly 900 firefighters were at the scene in a desperate bid to stop the conflagration enveloping the northern town of Istiaia.

Timothy Sheader’s production relocates the musical from New England to the north of England and dismantles the fatal romance at its heart

It is no surprise that Carousel was Richard Rodgers’ favourite of all his collaborations with Oscar Hammerstein. However, his exquisite score sits awkwardly with the dark kitchen-sink drama at the musical’s heart. The fatal romance – a blend of vicious masculinity and female acquiescence – is downright ugly, especially in the wake of a pandemic which has seen a dramatic increase in domestic violence.
It is debatable whether Rodgers and Hammerstein unwittingly romanticised a cliched version of brutish working-class manhood but Timothy Sheader’s production is all too aware of the queasiness it might create for contemporary audiences.

If not enough students choose to move, some of them may be asked to defer the year by their university. The move is expected to affect about a third of England’s 33 medical schools.

Prosecutors say the man on trial met his victim, a 43-year-old mechanic, on an online dating site a few hours before the September killing, the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported. They said there was no indication the victim had agreed to be killed.

Sharlene Whyte doesn’t just remember the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. When the 18-year-old was fatally stabbed while waiting for a bus in south-east London, it was “one of the defining moments” of her teenage years.
“Now I have a son who’s 17,” says the actor, “and every time he goes out, I have fears for him in terms of safety on the streets and the attitude of some police. It would have amazed me to think, at the time Stephen Lawrence was killed, that, nearly 30 years later, the same issues would still exist. It’s better, but there are still big problems.”

I’m sitting in my kitchen, about to try my first sip of a milk that is vegan, sequesters carbon and increases biodiversity. Dairy milk has a high carbon footprint. Soy is linked to deforestation, almond to high water use. But how does the new kid on the scene – hemp seed milk – measure up for taste?
An Innovative Farmers project coordinated by the Soil Association is investigating how industrial hemp production could aid the transition to a low-carbon economy. In collaboration with scientists at Cranfield University and the British Hemp Alliance, research will quantify the environmental benefits of growing hemp. In farm trials that launched last month, five farmers are helping to investigate this plant’s ability to sequester or store carbon, improve soil health and increase biodiversity.

We have all made sacrifices over the past 18 months. People have stayed home to protect others. Businesses have shuttered and many people have lost their incomes and jobs. Trips to see family members overseas have been cancelled; weddings have been postponed. As an initial strategy, these pandemic rules made sense. Our collective sacrifices saved lives and bought scientists time to deliver solutions. In the race to produce a vaccine, time was the currency that counted most.
But now we have several safe and effective vaccines. Hospitals are more experienced at dealing with Covid-19. We know that ventilating buildings, wearing face coverings indoors and avoiding crowded spaces and workplaces when feeling unwell all help to stop the spread of the virus.

Labour wrote to Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, after it emerged Bethell replaced his mobile phone before it could be searched for information relevant to £85m of Covid test deals that are subject to a legal challenge.

                    <span>Chris Rock, Jennifer Saunders and more have argued that ‘wokeness’ is stifling comedy. But the idea of the joke police is actually nonsense
Is cancel culture destroying comedy? A lot of comedians seem to think so. John Cleese has fretted that “wokeness” will “stifle creativity”. Chris Rock attributed all the “unfunny TV shows” he sees to the fact that “everybody’s scared to make a move”. Shappi Khorsandi wrote: “The fear of being ‘cancelled’ is real and it will be the death of standup comedy as we know it.”
When Dawn French was asked on Times Radio if she felt cancel culture was “imaginatively restrictive”, she said: “One hundred per cent yes,” before expressing concern about how a comic couldn’t do “edgy” material these days “because you’d just have so many haters on your back”. Ricky Gervais – also on Times Radio – said the BBC had become “more and more careful” and nowadays “would worry about some of the jokes” in The Office. Inbetweeners star James Buckley has said fear of causing offence was “killing comedy … there seems to be a joke police”.

                    <span>At Hang, Scotland’s first hip-hop conference, the country’s MCs are given a hero’s welcome – but there’s also important discussion about the prejudices they face
“Here’s a golden oldie,” Nova laughs, breaking into her 2019 single 3am. The crowd scream like she’s just won Olympic gold. This is Hang – Scotland’s first hip-hop conference – and it’s the Edinburgh rapper’s first IRL show since she bagged the Scottish Album of the Year award in 2020 for her debut Re-Up. Topping off a day packed with DJ workshops, breakdance, spoken word and panels of industry experts, Nova’s triumphant headline set is a middle finger to anyone who still thinks there’s no hip-hop in Scotland.
Ransom FA, an Aberdonian rapper who’s competed on BBC’s The Rap Game and shared stages with heavyweights such as Skepta and Wiley, says: “One of the biggest hurdles I had was being a young Black kid with a Scottish accent trying to enter an English-based scene. It was like: people from Aberdeen shouldn’t rap!” He raises an eyebrow incredulously. Edinburgh MC Lotos shares a similar story: “When I first started out, people didn’t see it as viable to be a Scottish rapper. I’d come to London and they’d be like, ‘They’ve got Black people in Scotland?’ And they still do that! I find it remarkable. So I just started touring in the US.”

                    <span>The competitive, for-profit model means investor returns have become more important than quality care and worker pay
The crisis in social care in the UK does not have just one cause, nor one simple solution. Chronic underfunding, an ageing population, the Brexit-induced labour shortage and the devastation wreaked by Covid-19 have all played a part. But the problems forcing the care system to the brink of collapse don’t just come from a series of exogenous shocks – they are internal too. The very structure of the sector is unstable.
The growing involvement of private equity, hedge funds and real estate investment trusts in the care sector in recent decades has brought about a rise in the use of predatory financial techniques, justified in the name of enticing capital into a sector that the government has persistently failed to adequately fund. According to data from the Care Quality Commission, these firms now own one in eight care home beds in England.

                    <span>Drinking at home was once a guilty pleasure. Now everyone from bored homeworkers to professional influencers is swapping cocktail recipes and photos of colourful aperitifs. Is gin o’clock turning into unhappy hour?
The shadow of a palm frond falls on a young woman in a bikini, holding an emerald-coloured cocktail in one manicured hand. A negroni glows from the depths of a darkened bar; a tray of fruit-laden glasses sits beside a swimming pool. The #cocktail hashtag on Instagram is a passport to a magical land of aspirational drinking, where everything comes garnished with rose petals and nobody ever seems to get hangovers.
Its inhabitants are a mix of amateur enthusiasts reviewing their latest discoveries, and professional “ginfluencers” making a living from creating lusciously photographed cocktail recipes or sponsored posts promoting this rhubarb gin or that new tequila. Colourful drinks are popular, says Inka Kukkamäki, a full-time drinks influencer whose @onthesauceagain account has 21,000 Instagram followers. “Something a bit interesting and unusual, or just something simple like a negroni – any kind of negroni twist becomes popular. The Italian aperitivo culture has really spread into the UK in the last year.”

                    <span>Prisons are fundamentally unjust, but a small, ethical and compassionate system would transform lives

Frances Crook is the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform

Nobody really cares about prisons. They are so far removed from the experience of most people and they are, apparently, full of horrid people. Occasionally, the media will run stories about rat-infested cells or suicide rates, but because so few people have anything to do with prisons, the stories soon fade and life for those on the outside continues as normal. 
But prisons matter. It matters who goes into them. It matters what happens inside them. And it matters how much they cost. Although prisons too often function like black holes into which society banishes those it deems problematic, the state of our prisons tells a story about all of us. Prisons reflect society back to itself: they embody the ways we have failed, the people we have failed, and the policies that have failed, all at immense human – and economic – cost.

Abandoned pits of former mining town fuel green jobs

The UK’s low carbon economy is now worth more than £200bn, four times the size of the country’s manufacturing sector, with growth expected to accelerate in the coming years, according to new analysis.
Despite what experts say has been lacklustre and patchy support from central government, the analysis found more than 75,000 businesses from wind turbine manufacturers to recycling plants employ more than 1.2 million people in the green economy.

Kevin Shaw remembers Seaham in its mining heyday, when the three pits in the town provided thousands of jobs and the network of red-brick terrace houses overlooking the sea were packed with miners and their families.
“It was a totally different place then all right,” says the 63-year-old looking out from a seafront cafe across a shimmering North Sea. “It was a very strong community, everyone had a connection to the mines … coal wagons would rattle across this road and down to the docks.”

All this could be about to change following the remarkable success of a project that is raising new life from the dust of Andalucía.

The package arrived on a Thursday. I came home from a walk and found it sitting near the mailboxes in the front hall of my building, a box so large and imposing I was embarrassed to discover my name on the label. It took all my strength to drag it up the stairs.
I paused once on the landing, considered abandoning it there, then continued hauling it up to my apartment on the third floor, where I used my keys to cut it open. Inside the box, beneath lavish folds of bubble wrap, was a sleek plastic pod. I opened the clasp: inside, lying prone, was a small white dog.

                    <span>A spate of attacks on one of the world’s busiest shipping trade routes is part of an escalating tit-for-tat conflict playing out between Iran and Israel, says Martin Chulov, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent
In the last week of July, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli company was making a routine journey from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates when it was hit by an explosive, believed to be a drone. Two men, a Romanian and a British national, were killed in the attack. The Israeli government immediately blamed Iran who has denied any part in it. 
The Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, tells Nosheen Iqbal that it is the latest action in what is now a rapidly escalating ‘shadow war’ between Israel and Iran. With both countries under new leadership in recent weeks, there is an added layer of unpredictability to relations that have been tense for some time.

Almost 150,000 students who did not receive offers from any university, or missed their required grades at A-level, will be hunting for remaining places on Tuesday – with the most popular institutions expected to have fewer remaining vacancies than usual.
With hundreds of thousands of school leavers receiving their A-level, BTec and Scottish highers grades, university admissions officers say a surge in applications, coupled with fierce competition, means those who miss out may face a longer wait to find a course.

It was a day of celebration. The players from the North British Rubber Company (NBRC) in Edinburgh’s Fountainbridge had been pitched against their rivals from Ramage &amp; Ferguson shipbuilders at no less a ground than Tynecastle Park, home of Heart of Midlothian football club.

Driver, 51, plays a widowed doctor in the forthcoming second series of Modern Love, the Amazon Prime show based on true stories from a New York Times column of the same name.

Women who experience greater height loss during middle age may be at higher risk of death, research suggests.
Scientists have previously found that shorter people may have an increased risk of heart disease, with researchers saying the two appear to be linked not just by lifestyle but by genes.

Torrential rain and thunderstorms have brought flooding and travel disruption to parts of the UK amid the wet start to August. Rail operators warned of blocked lines and cancellations on Monday, while motorists in some parts of the country negotiated water-filled roads.
The Met Office had earlier issued three yellow warnings for heavy showers and thunderstorms, covering parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London and southern England, which were due to expire by 9pm or 11pm.

‘We think women’s sport is riding a crest of a wave’

A decision is to be taken before the end of the year about the possible launch of a female British &amp; Irish Lions touring team. A feasibility study is under way with officials insisting they would like to see a Lionesses squad take the field in the not-too-distant future.
With the next men’s tour to Australia scheduled for 2025 there remain several logistical and financial hurdles to overcome if a women’s side is to tour, say, Australia and New Zealand during the same time period. Ben Calveley, the Lions’ chief executive, said further work had to be done on its viability but that he hoped it would eventually happen.

That deadline could be pushed up if the vaccine receives final US regulatory approval, beyond its current emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or if rising infection rates continue.

Hell is other people. Bad enough to spend lockdown finding out if your nearest really are your dearest. Much worse, spending eternity in a manor house with a newly dead bibulous, probably inbred blowhard called Barclay Beg-Chetwynde.
That is the nightmare scenario faced by the eponymous dead at the start of the third series of Ghosts (BBC One), a sitcom that envisages death as a kind of eternal quarantine. What is life, after all, but an everyday quarantine with irritating humans with whom one must, at the risk of otherwise going nuts, get along?

Panorama said it had obtained documents showing the former prime minister received the sum from cashing in shares he held in the company worth $4.5m (about £3.3m) in 2019, in addition to an annual salary of $1m (£720,000).

Masked men claiming to represent Mexico’s most powerful drug cartel have taken the unusual step of circulating a video threatening to kill a national television news anchor for what they viewed as unfair coverage.
The video circulated Monday showed masked and heavily armed men surrounding a man seated at a small desk who delivered a message he said was from Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, aka “El Mencho,” leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel. It was unclear if the person reading the message was Oseguera himself.

No 10 insisted the prime minister had full confidence in Sunak but his spokesman did not deny Johnson had threatened to demote the chancellor to health secretary amid a row about a leaked letter pushing Johnson to ease Covid restrictions.

‘I have always said I want to play Champions League’

Jack Grealish has said Britain’s most expensive footballer is “a good tag to have” and one he aims to repay by helping Manchester City finally win the Champions League this season.
The England international became the first £100m transfer in Premier League history when ending his 19-year stay with boyhood club Aston Villa last week. Rather than feel the pressure or burden of such a staggering fee, the 25-year-old insisted it fuelled his confidence to know how highly Pep Guardiola and the Premier League champions valued his talent.

The amusing line in the unfunny saga of a tobacco giant trying to buy a company that develops inhalers to treat lung diseases came last Friday when the board of Vectura, the target, switched its allegiance from Philip Morris to the rival bidder, the private equity firm Carlyle. The directors said it wasn’t only Carlyle’s higher offer they liked. They also noted “the reported uncertainties” for Vectura’s stakeholders if the Marlboro men were to win.
Those reports – everything from fury on the part of medical groups to threats to Vectura employees’ membership of scientific bodies – were entirely predictable. But, it seems, the board had failed until that point to spot the problem in a healthcare company accepting Big Tobacco’s dollar. Up until then the directors were prepared to swallow Philip Morris’s pitch that it wants to be a “wellness” company and will quit the fags one day, honest.

The new Spurs manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, and his players wandered around the pitch, waving at the fans, known these days as a lap of appreciation.
Were Spurs really doing this after a pre-season victory? In the moment, with the sun out briefly and supporters back in numbers, it felt a nice and natural thing to do; a reconnection. There was a warmth that went in both directions.

Coronavirus – latest updates

They are questions lurking in many people’s minds: just how upbeat or pessimistic should we be about the pandemic now? How does the UK compare with other countries? And is the worst of the crisis really over?
Two weeks after “freedom day” in England and with case numbers across the UK remaining lower than some modellers had feared, the worst seems to have eased. Future lockdowns, according to experts, seem unlikely unless new variants emerge.

Clothkits were as core to mid-1970s domestic do-it-yourself imagery as television’s The Wombles or The Good Life; they came as a length of fabric with all of a garment’s pieces printed on it to be cut out and sewn together for an outfit.
This did not feel like dressmaking, more like modelmaking with needle and scissors. And they had novel graphic appeal: where printed T-shirts used a torso as a billboard for a slogan or image, Clothkits patterns, silkscreened at first, were placed and shaped to the cut and construction of garments – around necklines, a skirt hem, down sleeves, like decoration on traditional folk costumes. Motifs might carry over to matching knickers or a bag to use up spare spaces on the cloth.

                    <span>Novelist known for exploring the lives of women and their relationships who had a deep commitment to her native Wales
The novelist Siân James, who has died aged 90, published books celebrating the lives and loves of women, especially Welsh women. In 1975 she won the Yorkshire Post first novel prize for One Afternoon, which announced the arrival of a mature new writer. In 1979 her third novel, A Small Country, won the Yorkshire Post novel prize. Over the following 40 years she published 13 novels, two collections of short stories and a memoir, The Sky Over Wales (1998). In 1997 her collection of short stories, Not Singing Exactly, won the Wales Book of the Year award.
Her focus was often on the relationships between women and men: marriage, affairs and the place a woman might win and hold for herself in a century that offered more freedoms and opportunities. Siân was deeply committed to Wales, its history and the political engagement of its people to the causes of pacifism and social reform, particularly feminism.

                    <span>The world’s political leaders must heed the dramatic warning that climate scientists have delivered
The sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published against a glowing backdrop of orange skies, as vast wildfires sweep through Greece and California. In western Germany, thousands of homes remain without running water or electricity following the devastating floods of July. In Yakutsk in Siberia – the coldest winter city on earth – residents were warned last month to stay inside as forest fires filled the air with toxic smoke, following heatwaves that began in the spring.
Eight years in the making, authored by the world’s leading climate scientists and approved by 195 national governments, the report confirmed the meaning of the evidence before our eyes: the cumulative impact of human activity since the Industrial Revolution is “unequivocally” causing rapid and potentially catastrophic changes to the climate. The future that environmental scientists foresaw with alarm, when the IPCC produced its first report three decades ago, has arrived.

                    <span>The Thatcherite wing of the Conservative party desires a restoration of ideas whose time has come and gone
The Conservative party hooked British capitalism to the state’s life support system for the past 18 months. So it takes chutzpah to think, as business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng does, of putting the free market at the heart of a post-Covid recovery. Yet lengthening NHS waiting lists, hiking consumer energy bills and welfare cuts when poverty is rising all betray a mindset that regards the re-legitimation of state intervention as threatening a way of life rather than securing it.
What the Thatcherite wing of the Conservative party desires is a restoration. For them this is an opportunity to go back to 1979 and use tried-and-tested ways to stabilise prices, crush labour and discipline poorer nations. These rightwingers yearn for higher interest rates, to prioritise financial returns on assets and the use of creditor power to squeeze the global south.

Sky News Australia has quietly deleted at least 31 videos that question the public health response to Covid-19 or promote unproven treatments as the broadcaster prepares for its chief executive, Paul Whittaker, to appear at a Senate inquiry on Friday, Guardian Australia can reveal.
Sky News will face the media diversity inquiry after the broadcaster was suspended from YouTube for seven days for posting 21 videos that violated the platform’s Covid medical misinformation policies.

                    <span>A new IPCC report makes clear what island nations have long warned. Their survival depends on urgent collective action
A new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds that the world may warm by 1.5°C by the early 2030s, much earlier than previously estimated. It’s terrible news for the Pacific. With temperatures rising above 1.5°C, Pacific communities are likely to experience increasingly devastating climate change impacts.
The key takeaway from the IPCC report is that the more we know, the worse it looks. The planet is now already between 0.8°C and 1.3°C warmer than in pre-industrial times – moving frighteningly close to the 1.5°C threshold. This warming has already worsened temperature extremes, such as marine heatwaves that cause coral bleaching and heatwaves on land, with dangerous consequences for human health. Temperature and other climate extremes will become more intense, frequent and appear in more locations with every fraction of a degree that the planet warms.

The billionaire boss of South Korea’s Samsung empire will be freed from jail on Friday after serving part of a 30-month sentence for bribing former South Korea president Park Geun-hye. 
Lee Jae-yong, Samsung’s vice-chairman and de facto leader, will be released on 13 August, the country’s justice minister announced in a live TV briefing.
Lee was caught up in a huge corruption scandal that brought down the government Park in 2016. Park was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 18bn won (£12m).

Armed fighters swept into the city of Aibak without meeting any resistance. The deputy chief of Samangan province confirmed that the local governor had withdrawn his soldiers in order to protect the civilian population. The Taliban were in “full control”, Sefatullah Samangani said.

The world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases must produce clear plans to cut their carbon output drastically, the president of vital UN climate talks has urged, after scientists warned there was only a small chance of escaping the worst ravages of climate breakdown.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out the starkest warning yet on the widespread and “unprecedented” changes to the climate that are “unequivocally” the result of human actions. Extreme weather resulting from these changes was already seen around the world and growing worse, in the form of rising temperatures, more frequent and fiercer storms, heatwaves, droughts, floods and sea level rises, according to the biggest assessment of climate science in eight years.

                    <span>Team over-reliant on Root in first Test with India
Moeen ready to shore up batting with spinning option

Moeen Ali is set to be added to England’s squad for Thursday’s second Test against India at Lord’s, with head coach Chris Silverwood also weighing up a possible return for Haseeb Hameed to shore up the top three.
The final-day washout at Trent Bridge on Sunday forced the two sides to settle for a draw but it is England who head into the follow-up match with more headaches. Chiefly, these stem from a batting unit that was bowled out for 183 on the opening day and stayed competitive in the match only through Joe Root’s scores of 64 and 109.

UK Sport has a strong, proven and ongoing commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion (Letter, 2 August). For the first time at a summer Olympics, Team GB contained more female athletes than male. And Britain’s women produced a host of trailblazing performances in Tokyo.
Laura Kenny became Britain’s most decorated female Olympian and the first British woman to win gold at three Olympics. Hannah Mills is now the most decorated female sailor in Olympic history, and Emily Campbell was the first British woman to win a weightlifting medal. And who can forget the 13-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown, Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist?

Psychotherapy over Zoom may not be a panacea, but it has been a boon during Covid-19 lockdowns (Therapy via Zoom should make mental healthcare available for all – it hasn’t, 3 August). I am an integrative psychotherapist and shied away from e-therapy in all forms, as it contravened my idea of the therapeutic frame within which I practised – rich with warmth and empathic relating.
With lockdown, I rapidly trained in online etiquette, contracting, indemnity, and safety and security. Zoom security was helpfully improved early in 2020. Could I be therapeutic digitally?

It started next to a caravan at the back of a church. We were going to Morocco – but only if the kids first had negative PCR tests. From a distance, it’s a formality, like checking in online and carefully confirming that you haven’t got a Swiss army knife in your hand luggage. Only when the date loomed up close did the reality kick in that they might actually have Covid and it would be wiser not to get too excited until we had the results.
By then, of course, it was too late. I was already too excited and all that anticipation segued effortlessly into nail-biting dread. My son was also biting his nails, which my daughter hates, but nothing drives her more bananas than when we both do it at the same time. It’s not the biting, apparently, but the melodramatic terror in our eyes. He wasn’t even worrying about the test, he was worried that the testing lady hadn’t got his passport number right and that he would get turned back on a technicality. “She asked me to check it against my passport and I said I had, but I’d only skimmed it.”

The Institute of Economic Affairs has lost a two-year battle with LBC radio presenter James O’Brien over claims the registered charity is a politically motivated lobbying organisation funded by “dark money”.
The IEA complained to media regulator Ofcom that the radio station had made a series of inaccurate and unfair suggestions that the organisation is a professional lobby group of “questionable provenance, with dubious ideas and validity” staffed by people who are not proper experts on their topic.

Team GB is not representative of the diversity of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with too many sports still dominated by white, suburban sportspeople and too few encouraging athletes from urban areas, according to a Sport England board member.
While the BMX riders Kye Whyte and Bethany Shriever have been standout stories of the Tokyo Olympics, the latter had to crowdfund and work as a teaching assistant to travel to competitions before British Cycling funded her in 2019. Another inspirational competitor, Emily Campbell, who became the first British woman to win a weightlifting medal when she took silver in the over-87kg category, also funded herself to glory.

The Orwell prize-winning book, about poet and teacher Clanchy’s time working in state schools, was first published in 2019. More recently, it has been criticised on Goodreads and Twitter, where passages in which Clanchy described children of colour and autistic students were shared.

Germany is bracing itself for complex coalition negotiations following September’s national elections, after the leaders of the two strongest parties failed to impress voters with their response to last month’s devastating floods and boosted the confidence of smaller parties.
A two-way coalition between the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of the outgoing chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the German Greens has long looked the most likely outcome when the country votes in seven weeks’ time, with polls showing a consistent governing majority between the two parties.

The UK band British Sea Power have changed their name to Sea Power, to avoid connotations with “isolationist, antagonistic nationalism”.
In a statement on their website, they say the original name was borne of “the elementary power of the oceans”, along with a reference to British naval supremacy made with “wry humour. The idea of British sea power in the historical sense was an obsolete thing. It was now just the name of a rock band. Now, 20 years later, we’re recasting the name. In recent times there’s been a rise in a certain kind of nationalism in this world – an isolationist, antagonistic nationalism that we don’t want to run any risk of being confused with. It’s become apparent that it’s possible to misapprehend the name British Sea Power, particularly if someone isn’t familiar with the band or their recordings.”

                    <span>In just five years, visual effects editor Jessica Atkinson has added Bafta-winner Mank among other acclaimed films to her portfolio. But, she says, the industry must do more to attract talent from diverse backgrounds
Film-making is an industry that increasingly boasts a vibrant range of creative voices, both in front of the camera and behind it. But what about behind the scenes? Visual effects editor Jessica Atkinson, who entered the industry five years ago in a non-traditional way, is keen to encourage others from diverse backgrounds to get involved, especially with lesser-seen roles, and take a seat at the table.
“I didn’t know anything about [the visual effects industry] before I got into it,” says Atkinson, who now has a range of acclaimed projects in her portfolio – including credits on films Adrift, Annihilation and the Bafta-winning Mank, TV series Brave New World, upcoming film The 355, and a campaign with Adidas. “I came out of college without the A-levels or grades that I thought I would have, and I didn’t go to university because I couldn’t make up my mind. I was a bit lost. But I always drifted towards entertainment and storytelling. I used to dance and then I was convinced I was going to be an actor.”

                    <span>The UK government has been lambasted for spending £100,000 on two works by Cathy Wilkes and Willie Doherty. But the Government Art Collection is not in the same category as the Johnsons’ curtains
As the hands of a clock turn, so, every few years, will there be a set of headlines condemning the Government Art Collection. So it is now: the Mirror has whipped up a small storm of protest over the fact that an artwork by Willie Doherty (price, £18,775) has gone on display in No 10, Downing Street. So has another by Cathy Wilkes (price, £70,200). Both works were acquired by the Government Art Collection. The Mirror has placed these works, by implication, in the category of the Johnsons’ “corrupt curtains” – the red-hot issue of soft furnishings for the family’s apartment at No 10 that somehow seems to threaten the prime minister more severely than, say, the brute fact of 125,000 deaths from Covid-19. “Nearly £100,000 spent on Downing St paintings as Boris Johnson prepares to slash benefits,” runs the headline.
Let’s straighten a few things out. First, any good government should be spending money on benefits and culture. Setting them in opposition is disingenuous and unfair. But to turn specifically to the Government Art Collection: the body is run by a director and a set of curators, independent of party-political allegiance. It cares for a collection of around 14,500 works of both historic and contemporary art. Acquisitions are regularly made, not according to the whim of a politician or their spouse, but with the help of an expert panel that includes the directors of Tate Britain and the National Portrait Gallery in London. A number of works were acquired to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland this year; both Wilkes and Doherty were born there (Wilkes is now based in Glasgow, Doherty in Donegal).

Tommy Jessop was 22 when he first saw a character with Down’s syndrome on screen. “It was … me!” he says with a grin, sitting in his family’s living room. In the BBC TV drama Coming Down the Mountain in 2007, Jessop played a disabled teenager despised by his older brother. It captured Jessop’s ability to fully realise his characters on screen. “Making viewers feel emotions is my passion in life,” says Jessop.
In person, the 36-year-old is animated company. There are many things Jessop thinks are either “brilliant” or “wicked”, including but not limited to: receiving an honorary doctorate in arts from the University of Winchester, his “top secret” new acting project, being a volunteer usher at the Theatre Royal, Callum Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin from Newcastle United, Bradley Walsh’s The Chase, and presenting an award at the 2021 Bafta ceremony. His recent passion project is cooking, where he shares the results on Twitter with his nearly 30,000 followers. (“I’ve made flapjacks and cakes, shepherd’s pie and fish pie,” he says.)

Jasmine Jobson always knew she wanted to be an actor – she just took an irregular route to get there. At 26, the Bafta-nominated Top Boy actor is one of the most exciting new talents in the industry, scoring a starring role in the acclaimed BBC adaptation of Noughts + Crosses and acting alongside thespian favourite Ben Whishaw in the gritty 2020 thriller Surge. To hear Jobson talk about her career is to listen to someone still in amazement at her accomplishments, and for good reason. Jobson says she was branded “the most difficult child in Westminster” by social services as a teenager.
“Singing, dancing, acting – I could pretty much do anything,” Jobson remembers of her early childhood, speaking from a hotel room in Cape Town, where the second series of Noughts + Crosses is currently being filmed. She started singing at the age of two – “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, all the Disney songs – you name it, I sung it”. At four or five years old, her mother got her a Madame Butterfly CD and said: “You really think you can sing? Try that.” Jobson laughs: “I was up at 6am singing opera in the bath.” Her parents sent her to Paddington Arts, a west London youth centre that develops young people’s creativity, but she had to leave once the family began struggling financially.

The devastating scale of destruction from a week of wildfires in Greece and Italy was being assessed as the EU mounted one of its largest firefighting operations ever and smoke from forest fires in Siberia reached the north pole.
As UN experts on Monday said global warming was advancing faster than feared and that humanity was “unequivocally” to blame, firefighters and local residents battled massive blazes on the island of Evia, east of Athens, for a seventh straight day.

                    <span>Lindsey Woodward had to overcome numerous obstacles before she became a successful editor. Here, she discusses her approach to the craft – and why hiring talent from diverse backgrounds is so important for the industry
Lindsey Woodward is a film editor on a rapid rise, with recent credits including the Bafta-winning series I May Destroy You. As a woman in a male-dominated profession, and an industry outsider who managed to break through, Woodward knows success doesn’t come easily.
Hailing from the town of Ilkeston in Derbyshire, where her mother worked in a hospital and her father was a mechanic, Woodward was “one of the very few people” in her family to go to university. During photography and video coursework, she found herself drawn to editing. “It was only when I got into the editing suite that I really had fun and enjoyed myself,” she says, recalling working with Adobe Premiere Pro to assemble the rushes from short film projects. “I didn’t know how it all worked, but I was getting in early and the days were flying by.”

Police in Spain are investigating after a half-tonne fighting bull pushed its way out of a bullring, injuring two people as it charged through the streets of a small town in central Spain before being reportedly rammed to death by a car.
The incident took place in the early hours of Sunday as many in the village of Brihuega, population 2,400, had gathered in the local bullring to take in a concurso de recortadores, in which participants take turns jumping, twirling and manoeuvring around a bull or heifer in hopes of being deemed the most “courageous” in the ring.

                    <span>In a chilling erosion of our freedom of expression, ministers will have the power to suppress any protest they don’t agree with
Tucked away in the government’s 300-page police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, are various clauses which will have serious implications for the right to protest. The bill seeks to quietly criminalise “serious annoyance”, increase police powers to restrict protests, and give the home secretary discretion over what types of protests are allowed.
It is striking that such an enormous bill had its second reading less than a week after it was published and was only allocated two days of debate. It appears that the government had hoped to pass it quickly and without fanfare, but instead the introduction of the bill coincided with the fallout from the police response to the Sarah Everard vigil and ultimately sparked in Bristol the very thing it sought to limit: protests.

In June 2006, the FBI arrested seven men from the poor, predominantly black neighborhood of Liberty City, in Miami, on charges no less than attempting to wage war on America. In a boastful press conference, then attorney general Alberto Gonzales, outlined an ambitious, chilling plot to blow up Chicago’s Sears Tower, to launch a “full ground war against the United States”, and to support al-Qaida.

                    <span>As the comics giants make billions from their storylines and characters, writers and artists are speaking out about their struggles for fair payment
Watch any superhero movie and you will see a credit along the lines of “based on the comic book created by”, usually with the name of a beloved and/or long-dead writer or artist. But deep, deep in the credits scroll, you will also see “special thanks” to a long roster of comic book talent, most of them still alive, whose work forms the skeleton and musculature of the movie you just watched. Scenes storyboarded directly from Batman comics by Frank Miller; character arcs out of Thor comics by Walt Simonson; entire franchises, such as the Avengers films or Disney+ spinoff The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, that couldn’t exist without the likes of Kurt Busiek or Ed Brubaker.
The “big two” comic companies – Marvel and DC - may pretend they’ve tapped into some timeless part of the human psyche with characters such as Superman and the Incredible Hulk, but the truth is that their most popular stories have been carefully stewarded through the decades by individual artists and writers. But how much of, say, the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) $20bn-plus box office gross went to those who created the stories and characters in it? How are the unknown faces behind their biggest successes being treated?

To be frank, there were not loads of them across the three Test matches so I’ll plump for the obvious one. When Morné Steyn was named as part of the South Africa squad, you had to wonder. When he was selected on the bench, you could see it coming, and when he came on to the field with two minutes to go there was an inevitability that 12 years on from kicking the Springboks to victory over the Lions he would do precisely the same again. Warren Gatland had the grace to chuckle at what fate had dealt his side. Steyn’s second coming was an irresistible narrative in a series that, on the field at least, did not provide too many. GM

However, if the pub name is something with legs, then you get extra points – one point per leg, eg the Man and Dog would be seven points (two for the man, four for the dog, plus one for the pub itself). I once got The Shepherd and Flock and was delighted! It’s also minus one point if the name has “arms” in it, eg, The King’s Arms. Kate Griffith, Shropshire

                    <span>There has been a loud and disgusted backlash against US rapper DaBaby after he made homophobic remarks. But queer MCs explain that there’s still more work to be done
After seeing the online backlash to rapper DaBaby’s recent homophobic and misogynistic onstage remarks, Bugz Gutta was “shocked and grateful”. Born William Bailey, the up-and-coming New York MC, a proudly out black gay man, is still adjusting to such positive outcomes. He dubs himself “hip-hop’s Omar from The Wire”, thanks to his prior life of crime and the years he spent behind bars, enduring verbal, physical and sexual abuse before finding peace and success as a musician. He hopes the fallout that DaBaby has faced “sets an example. So people realise it’s not OK to put hate and harm out there.”
Last week, DaBaby ranted on stage: “If you didn’t show up today with HIV, Aids … that’ll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cellphone lighter up.” The rapper, whose 2020 album Blame It on Baby became his second US No 1 in less than a year, then said: “Ladies, if your pussy smell like water… Fellas, if you ain’t sucking dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lighter up.” As pushback mounted online, DaBaby truculently apologised – “But the LGBT community... I ain’t trippin on y’all, do you. Y’all business is y’all business” – and released a music video where he held up a sign reading “Aids” before shooting a pair of men. His Levitating collaborator Dua Lipa, the Roots’ drummer Questlove, Madonna and Elton John all decried him; US radio stations dropped his version of Levitating from playlists. After the Lollapalooza festival and others axed DaBaby from their lineups, he apologised more soberly on Instagram, but has since deleted that apology.

                    <span>If the Olympic authority was really interested in building a better world, it would applaud athletes who send messages of social justice
With the Tokyo Olympics now in the rear-view mirror, it’s useful to reflect on how one of the most interesting athletes at the Games has been treated.
When the lovable shot putter Raven Saunders, who is a black, gay woman, won a silver medal, she used the occasion to cross her arms in an X – a gesture of solidarity at “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet”. There are two ways we might expect the Olympics to approach this.

Modern Toss on whether artistry is a result of nature or nurture

Genius cannot be taught but skills can. And even the wildest, most visionary of artists relies on the techniques they were taught. If you want to make digital art, you need to learn to code. A training in film will help with moving-image art. So much is obvious. But today we’re in thrall to a vacuous Romanticism that insists artists are born not made.

Covid vaccine hesitancy has almost halved among 18- to 21-year-olds in Great Britain, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.
The figures also suggest increasing numbers of 16- and 17-year-olds are willing to have the jab, as hesitancy has decreased from 14% to 11%. Older teenagers are now able to get one after the decision was announced last week to extend the rollout to that age group.

Patrick Vallance is the UK government chief scientific adviser

The release today of the first part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report makes for stark reading. It reaffirms that anthropogenic climate change is real, present and lasting: it is now unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land to an unprecedented degree, with effects almost certain to worsen through the coming decades.
The report also dispels any notion that the effects of the climate crisis are abstract or distant. Extreme events are being felt across the world, from wildfires in Australia, Sweden and north-west America to heatwaves in Siberia and Canada and the devastating drought in South Africa. Evidence has grown since the last assessment report that human activity has exacerbated extreme weather events. Without urgent action, such events will continue to get worse. Moreover, sea levels are projected to rise over this century. Rises of as much as 2m cannot be ruled out, leaving low-lying lands and coastal communities extremely vulnerable.

‘It’s difficult to live a normal life’: MS patient denied drug

People with multiple sclerosis are paying up to £600 a month for a “life-changing” drug that is available on the NHS in Wales and Scotland but not in England.
Charities estimate that tens of thousands of people with MS are missing out on fampridine, which can improve a person’s ability to walk and reduce the risk of falling over.

MS charities decry UK postcode lottery for ‘life-changing’ drug

Steven Brooks’s ability to walk improved significantly when he took the multiple sclerosis drug fampridine for nine months as part of a clinical trial. However, the 67-year-old former butcher’s health has declined since the trial ended and he could not get the drug on the NHS from his local hospital in Essex, because it has not been approved for use in England.
“I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in my mid-30s when I had numbness in my right hand. My doctor put it down to repetitive strain injury from me using a chopper in butchering but it turned out to be MS.

1 African wrap from The Nile Valley Cafe 
A stone’s throw from the University of Edinburgh campus, Sudanese joint The Nile Valley Cafe has been satiating the appetites of lecturers and students alike for years. Having made its name from its tantalising fusion of North African and Middle Eastern ingredients, the African wrap is perhaps the apotheosis of its signature flavour. A grilled tortilla binds together falafel that’s crispy on the outside and wonderfully herby on the inside, alongside feta, hummus and stewed ful beans, all lathered in a spicy sauce.

When Elke moved to Switzerland from Brazil in 1994, romance had not crossed her mind. “My brother had been diagnosed with Aids,” she says. “He was living there and I went to care for him.” Sadly, he died in December that year, but Elke decided to stay and explore the country. “My brother loved Switzerland because it was more liberal than Brazil. He encouraged me to live there for a while.” She started an admin job with the European Tennis Association (now Tennis Europe) in the new year. “I think my boss felt sorry for me because I was feeling so sad all the time,” she says. “She wanted to set me up with one of her friends, but I wasn’t interested in dating.”
One night, she agreed to attend a small dinner party that her boss was hosting. When she arrived, Mike was already sitting on the sofa. He was originally from the UK, but had been living in Switzerland for several years, working in IT. “My friend had told me about this incredibly interesting Brazilian woman,” he says. “I brushed it off because I’d come out of a long relationship and wasn’t looking for anything.”

In one of the communal gardens that skirt a dusty, tangerine block near the Palladium in Garbatella is a small forest of tomato vines. Yesterday (and I am writing this on 13 July), the cherry ones were almost all ripe, hundreds of bright, red balls netted in twisting green, while the bigger, heart-shaped ones were still green bags. I curbed my kleptomania, despite the fact several tomatoes were poking so far through the railings that they seemed to be trying to prod me. I thought I had curbed my son’s, too, by shouting so loudly that a woman looked out of her window. But then later, when we sat down for wine and lemonade in a trendy but hugely likable place called La Mescita, I’m sure there was a seed on his lip.
We took another route back to the car so we could enjoy another part of Garbatella, a Roman neighbourhood sometimes referred to as a borgata – a hamlet on the outskirts – and at others a quartiere paese, which translates loosely as “village within a city”. In another garden under a pale yellow lotto (or block), we spotted more bounty in an orto, or vegetable garden, of the kind that brings out deep envy in me: of the tomatoes and peppers, aubergines, onions, as well as of the care the owner took to grow them.

A year has passed since Belarusians took to the streets to challenge the authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, over stolen elections, marking the greatest crisis of his 27 years in power and the most harrowing year in the country’s modern history.
In an interview, the opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya issued a message of defiance tinged with pain as she detailed the toll that the last year has taken on the 35,000 jailed, hundreds tortured, and thousands more forced to flee the country or hide from Lukashenko’s crackdown.

Silma and Binit had been married for two years when they found out they were expecting a “planned, unplanned” baby in December 2019. “We weren’t actively trying, but we knew we wanted to have a baby the following year,” says Silma, sitting in her garden in London. “So we were ecstatic. Really, really happy.” Everything was normal at the 12-week scan in January, and they felt ready to tell their friends, family and colleagues. Silma is a pharmacist at a busy London hospital; Binit works in finance.
Fast forward to March 2020; the day before the couple’s 20-week scan was scheduled, lockdown was announced. The local hospital they had booked in with had already been badly hit by Covid admissions, as well as staff shortages as medics were redeployed or self-isolating. “It was all a bit of a panic,” says Silma, “so I went in on my own, thinking – how naive it was of me to think this – I was there to find out if it was a boy or a girl. I didn’t even want to know, particularly. I had just always thought that’s what the 20-week scan was about.” Binit, who was not allowed to accompany Silma, was waiting outside. He is a softly spoken man who says as much about his feelings with his eyes and his silences as with his voice; he is clearly still traumatised by the memory of that wait.

Captured from Nevada and shipped to the opposite side of the country by the Bureau of Land Management, she has never experienced human contact. Her mane is matted down, as no one has been able to groom her since she first arrived here in rural Monroe County, New York, 10 months ago.

As a verdict on the climate crimes of humanity, the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report could not be clearer: guilty as hell.
The repeatedly ignored warnings of scientists over past decades have now become reality. Humanity, through its actions, or lack of action, has unequivocally overheated the planet. Nowhere on Earth is escaping rising temperatures, worse floods, hotter wildfires or more searing droughts.

                    <span>UK Sport chair Dame Katherine Grainger talks of need for lasting legacy for grassroots sport to follow in wake of torrent of medals, moments and emotion
Medals. Moments. And now more. That was the message emanating from Team GB chiefs after an extraordinary 16 days in Tokyo, during which Britain not only equalled their medal haul at London 2012 but forged into new and unexpected areas, including BMX, skateboarding, and weightlifting.
There were also performances of soul and glow, with athletes such as Jonny Brownlee and Tom Daley beaming as they climbed to the highest step of the podium after so many near misses. Familiar favourites such as Jason and Laura Kenny and Charlotte Dujardin ripened their legacy. And the sight of new working-class heroes such as Emily Campbell, thrusting 161kg above her head to win silver. White, black, rich, poor: all were represented. Never has Team GB looked more like Typical GB.

                    <span>Inspired by a YouTube video and high on a dose of Olympic spirit, this week the activity is gymnastic. But will the results be fantastic?
I once saw an inspirational video of a man teaching himself to backflip in a park, with a mattress behind to break his fall. He got closer and closer, but kept landing on his knees. The breakthrough moment came when he realised the 20cm mattress was taking up space. The cushion that kept him safe was also keeping him from his dream. He removed it and completed the flip. I wept. It’s not about jumping, OK? It’s profoundly existential.
The jumping did suggest an urgent question, though: could I do a backflip? Do you have to be Superman, or one of seven lords-a-leaping? I never dared to learn. The optics of dragging a mattress into a park – especially when some people are already confused about how you earn a living – are not good. Yet, with Olympic spirit still hanging in the air, the timing is right.

                    <span>The veteran journalist, who moved to Moscow in 1988, charted the collapse of a superpower. But, he tells his successor, the Gorbachev revolution has been poisoned
When Jonathan Steele moved to Moscow for the Guardian in 1988, the story of Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms was getting “hotter and hotter”. But with all the restrictions on foreign journalists in the Soviet Union, the question was how to report it. The sources were mainly local journalists authorised to speak to foreigners or dissidents. The phones were likely to have been bugged. You could not travel more than 25 miles out of Moscow without permission and travel plans needed to be sent to the foreign ministry in advance by Telex.
“It was very annoying because you wanted to go to someplace because there was a story, but because there was a story they didn’t want to give you permission,” Steele recalled.

In 2017, Jennie Agg had the first of what would be four miscarriages. Despite being told by medics that losing a pregnancy was incredibly common, she found that there was not a lot of solid information out there about what had actually happened to her. 
Now more and more high-profile women, including the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, are deciding to share their own stories of miscarriage. But as Jennie tells Rachel Humphreys, the conversations we have about miscarriage have changed very little over the years.

Golden objects unearthed from ancient burial mounds built by the Saka warrior people of central Asia – a culture which flourished from around the eighth century BC to the third century BC – will go on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum.

                    <span>Summerhall, Edinburgh
Mamoru Iriguchi and Afton Moran raid their dressing-up box to give us a cheery guide to the evolutionary history of reproduction, and what it says about gender fluidity in humans
I imagine the curriculum has changed since my day but, even so, I’m pretty sure not many biology lessons look like this one by Mamoru Iriguchi. With a dressing-up-box aesthetic and a naive enthusiasm, the Edinburgh performer casts the audience in the role of 14-year-old pupils at “Summerhall secondary school”. Ably assisted by Afton Moran, using hand-knitted pubic hair and clownfish costumes as visual aids, and making natty use of a computer monitor that turns real-world objects into screen animations, he takes us through the evolutionary story of reproduction. It’s an illustrated lecture that traces the journey from the earliest sea creatures to the appearance of land animals and onwards to the present day.
The show has a rough-and-ready charm, performed with more enthusiasm than subtlety, and an appropriately adolescent sense of humour. It takes a wide-eyed approach to the allure of human nudity (no other creature is turned on by nakedness) and the magic of organisms that can reproduce by severing parts of their own body .

Ramsbotham is the chief executive of the North East England Chamber of Commerce and speaks for thousands of businesses caught by the red tape and extra costs of complying with EU rules. In a recent survey, 38% of members said sales to Europe had fallen since January.

The government has launched a £4m fund to back projects trialling running fibre optic broadband cables through water pipes to help connect hard-to-reach homes without digging up roads.
The money will also be used to test out monitors in pipes that can help water companies identify and repair leaks more quickly. About a fifth of water put into public supply every day is lost via leaks and it is hoped that sensors could help deliver water companies’ commitment to reduce water loss by half.

Lions concept is ‘alive and kicking’ says Ben Calveley

Warren Gatland has been told by the British &amp; Irish Lions hierarchy that the job of head coach for the 2025 tour of Australia is his if he wants it, despite the series defeat by South Africa. Gatland refused to rule out a fourth tour as head coach in the aftermath of the defeat by the Springboks and he has subsequently received the firm backing of the Lions chairman, Jason Leonard, and the managing director, Ben Calveley.

Newcastle have agreed a fee in the region of £22m with Arsenal to sign Joe Willock.
The midfielder, 21, spent the second half of last season on loan at St James’ Park, scoring eight goals as he helped the Magpies maintain their Premier League status.

When Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu and concrete buildings collapsed, their iron roofing blown away, there was no loss of life in the traditionally built structures known as saeklon haos (cyclone house).
Though they normally sleep six, during the 2015 storm up to 30 villagers were able to squeeze in together, physically supporting the house posts from the inside if needed.

So how was it for you? Whether you loved or hated them, you have to admit these Olympic Games were a crazy proposition. With 206 competing teams, they were bigger and more diverse than the United Nations and – with an estimated bill of at least £12bn, 111% over budget – the Japanese could have bought 300 new 300-bed hospitals, or 1,200 elementary schools, with what they cost to put on.
The Games always have been, and always will be, like this. Which is why, when the French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin first suggested reviving the ancient Olympics in a speech at the Sorbonne in 1892, a lot of the people in the audience thought he was joking.

Tori-Allen Martin’s two-hander opens with the audience watching at home – then the second half is performed in person
The concept is the strongest part of Tori Allen-Martin’s two-act play, the first half of which we watch prerecorded at home, the second live in the theatre. Following the performers from screen to stage is a smart form of storytelling, creating a sense of anticipation with the prebuilt backstory we uncover online. But that’s where the innovation stops with this two-hander.
Filmed as if on Zoom, act one finds Liv (Allen-Martin) and Theo (Tim Bowie) catching up during the pandemic after a fraught break in their more-than-friendship. Online, they joke and push through small talk, clear that something harder to discuss lies underneath. Directed by Christa Harris, this first part has the natural pace of Zoom conversations that we’re now so familiar with, but after two years of jolting screens and missed sentences, it comes too late in the wave of pandemic theatre to feel anything other than formulaic.

Liverpool were dealt an injury blow less than a week before the start of the Premier League season after Andy Robertson hobbled off in a friendly against Athletic Bilbao at Anfield.
The Scotland left-back, who started every league match last season, had to be helped from the pitch by the medical team shortly before half-time after badly twisting his ankle while he attempted to stop a cross by Álex Berenguer.

Majority leader Chuck Schumer stressed to colleagues that they could proceed the “easy way or the hard way”, while a few Republican senators appeared determined to run out the clock for days. “We’ll keep proceeding until we get this bill done,” Schumer said.

His comments also came as one of America’s largest teachers unions appeared to shift its position on mandatory vaccinations for teachers.

Thousands of people have fled wildfires that are destroying vast swathes of pine forest and razing homes on Greece’s second-largest island, Evia, as devastating summer blazes rage from southern Europe to Siberia.
“We have ahead of us another difficult evening, another difficult night,” Greece’s deputy civil protection minister, Nikos Hardalias, said on Sunday, adding that nearly a week after the blazes started, strong winds were driving two major fire fronts in the north and south of the island.

It’s hardly a spoiler to reveal that the chief protagonist of Jennifer Mills’s latest novel dies. It is fleeting, fragmented, violent, and over by page four – but it is not the end. “Evicted” from their own body, microbiology student Yun’s consciousness soon coalesces, unsteadily at first, into that of another person. And then another, and another, and another.
“It jumped into my body,” Mills says of the premise of The Airways, which first struck her during a residency in Beijing a decade ago. “I was on the subway one day, I must have just been daydreaming as I usually do, and this thought of a ghost that could jump between bodies almost jumped into me.”

                    <span>Emmanuel Macron’s new health measures are generally backed. But a worryingly large minority no longer trusts the state to act in the interests of all
By French standards, the protests which have now taken place across the country on four consecutive weekends have not been huge. On Saturday, an estimated 230,000 marchers filled streets and squares to oppose a new Covid pass which will be required from Monday. Two years ago, by comparison, nearly four times as many turned out to contest President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed pension reforms. Polls indicate that a large majority of French citizens back the new regulations, which mean that visitors to restaurants and other public settings must show proof of vaccination or a negative test. The rules will also make jabs mandatory for health workers and those in some other professions.
Since Mr Macron signalled his intent to move in this direction last month, Europe has been following suit, although, in England, Boris Johnson has preferred to wait. Germany plans to bring in similar measures within weeks. Italy rolled out its “green pass” on Friday. The public health benefits of increasing vaccination rates and making social contexts as safe as possible are unarguable. Since the Covid pass was announced amid concerns over the spread of the Delta variant, France’s vaccination rate has boomed. Well over 60% of those over the age of 12 have now had a first jab. The constitutional court ruled on Thursday that the pass represented a “balanced trade-off” between public health concerns and individual freedom. Having generally taken popular opinion with him, Mr Macron is entitled to consider the policy a success. But there are good reasons for him – and other European leaders – to pay close attention to the nature of the ongoing dissent.

Claims by the Morrison government that Australia has done more to cut greenhouse gas emissions than other countries have been challenged by an analysis that found it has gone backwards compared to similar countries over the past 15 years.
Energy analyst Dr Hugh Saddler ranked the performance of 23 OECD countries and Russia on eight climate measures, including share of electricity from non-fossil fuels, per capita emissions from transport and overall emissions intensity of each economy.

Giants’ head coach Ian Watson: ‘Pryce is a special talent’

There is a suggestion that given the state of the Super League table, with Leigh Centurions almost certain to be relegated to the Championship, that clubs such as Huddersfield and Wakefield have nothing more to play for this season. Yet given the post-match reaction of both coaches here, that felt anything like the mood.
Huddersfield’s head coach, Ian Watson, labelled this comeback win the most satisfying of his time in charge so far, and it is not difficult to see why. Trailing 18-0 after 14 minutes and then losing half-back Oliver Russell to a head injury, the Giants faced the unenviable task of producing a turnaround with just one recognised half-back, who was making only his sixth senior appearance.

                    <span>The simplest artefact can spark as much emotion as gold or grand monuments
A find of ancient fruit baskets – still with their plump doum fruits inside – attracted headlines last week. Around 2,400 years old, they were discovered off the coast of Egypt among the remains of Thonis-Heracleion, the once-busy Mediterranean entrepôt that began to sink into Aboukir Bay sometime in the second century BC.
The golden splendours of ancient “treasure” have a more obvious glamour and appeal than a few date-like fruits. One thinks of Sophia Schliemann wearing the spectacular jewellery found at Troy in the 1870s by her husband, Heinrich Schliemann – not a man who will be remembered for his punctilious archaeological technique. The great monuments of antiquity, too, have the capacity to thrill and impress: the Parthenon, or the great citadel of Machu Picchu, or the pyramids of Egypt. But at least as often, it is humble, everyday objects that capture the imagination, that make the onlooker feel they could reach out through a chink in time and touch the past.

Afghanistan could once again become a base for international terrorism, according to a former senior UK military commander who has described the withdrawal of western troops as a “strategic mistake”.
As the Taliban continued to make sweeping territorial gains, Gen Sir Richard Barrons warned that attacks in Europe could be the outcome of groups re-establishing themselves in the country.

                    <span>The first match may have ended in a soggy draw but the sides generated enough excitement to suggest this series will provide a welcome advert for Test cricket
The batsman hit the bowler straight back over his head, a sweetly timed, powerfully struck shot that surely ranked among the biggest seen in these conditions. It will never be known how far it might have travelled – a six surely, but into the stands or out of the stadium? – because of the wall in the way. As it was, the ball bounced off brick and into the outstretched hand of the fielder standing in a position that somehow combined silly mid-off with long-off. One hand one bounce. The batter was gone.
It was the best action the spectators got all day at Trent Bridge. For most of Sunday – excluding two tantalising patches of sunshine – the wet conditions confined the optimistic fans who stuck around to whatever shelter they could find. Umbrellas, awnings and bars came into play – even the huddled trio of chairs under the stairwell in the Radcliffe Road Stand known as the Hadlee Waiting Area, long assumed to be an existential joke understood only by the Notts faithful. And here, on the concourse, where a man called Sunit had constructed a wicket from rucksacks and got the passing kids playing with a soft ball and a plastic bat.

The fires, floods and extreme weather seen around the world in recent months are just a foretaste of what can be expected if global heating takes hold, scientists say, as the world’s leading authority on climate change prepares to warn of an imminent and dire risk to the global climate system.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will on Monday publish a landmark report, the most comprehensive assessment yet, less than three months before vital UN talks that will determine the future course of life on Earth.

Farewell then, Tokyo 2020. On a sweltering night at the Olympic Stadium, Japan said goodbye to its troubled, quietly glorious Games with a closing ceremony that was by turns elegant, sombre and hilariously unbound. Not to mention, in the grand Olympic tradition, crammed full of schmaltz and corporate doublespeak.
At 10pm local time the IOC president, Thomas Bach, emerged on to his lighted plinth to declare Tokyo 2020 closed – and to offer up something else too, to lobby for its place in history.

The British airline Virgin Atlantic is considering raising funds on the London Stock Exchange in an attempt to shore up its balance sheet.
The listing, which is expected to be announced in the autumn, is likely to see the billionaire Sir Richard Branson relinquish overall control of the business. His Virgin Group currently owns 51% of the airline with the US-based Delta Air Lines owning the rest.

The six-year-old animal is facing a death sentence after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a deadly respiratory disease that has blighted the countryside for decades.

Sitting in a book-lined office, Viktor Orbán, prime minister of Hungary, agreed it was “one of the capitals” producing “very nice ideas”. He went on to praise Donald Trump as “a great friend of Hungary” and laud the former US president’s “America first” foreign policy.

As relatively cool temperatures and higher humidity slowed the Dixie fire raging across northern California on Saturday, attention shifted to the role an already disgraced utility company may have played in the gigantic blaze.
By Saturday evening, the Dixie fire covered 447,723 acres and had destroyed 370 structures, including residential, commercial and other buildings. The fire was only 21% contained, and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection did not expect full containment until 20 August.

Interpreters who assisted British forces in Afghanistan have played a fundamental role, standing side by side with those on the frontline of combat. For that we owe a debt of gratitude – one that we are paying, contrary to the claims of Clive Lewis MP (I saw Afghan interpreters translate so much more than words – now they live in terror, 6 August).
There are hundreds of officials working without pause across the country and in Afghanistan to safely and quickly relocate current and former locally employed staff who often risked their lives on our behalf. They are arriving here with their families on a near-daily basis to build a new life. So far, we have enabled over 2,800 people to relocate to Britain, with 1,400 arriving over the last few weeks alone. As we continue to significantly accelerate the pace of relocations due to the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, hundreds more will follow.

                    <span>Bob Ross is at odds with Tory plans to introduce Latin lessons in state schools
I had to have a quiet chuckle at the education secretary’s plans to spend £4m on teaching Latin to the sons and daughters of the hoi polloi (Cartoon, 1 August). My first thought was, why not ancient Greek? Then I wondered how the “fortunate” 40 state schools would be selected. And then – simply, why? Is there a pent-up demand by secondary school students to learn Latin while more useful modern languages are struggling to get enough takers to fill a class? 
I have the dubious distinction of having passed O-grade Latin back in the mid-1960s while I was at a local secondary school in Edinburgh. It could be an entertaining way to get “the tawse” by conjugating the Latin verb for “to love” as “Amo, amas, amat, amamus, adaddymus and ababymus”, but otherwise it was a waste of time. I had wanted to learn German.

Eighteen months on, many people in this close-knit corner of south Wales continue to suffer. “I still have nightmares about the river rising again,” said Katie Whelan, whose end-of-terrace house in the village of Ynyshir, near Pontypridd, was flooded.

 Spain has ordered small boats to steer clear of a stretch of the country’s southern coast after reports of more than 50 encounters with boisterous orcas, including as many as 25 incidents in which boats had to be towed to shore.
A two-week prohibition bars most vessels of 15 metres or less from sailing near the coast between Cape Trafalgar and the small town of Barbate. It is the second time in 13 months that Spain’s ministry of transport has taken action to address a spate of extraordinary orca encounters that have baffled scientists.

                    <span>Britain did not dominate Tokyo on two wheels as they once did but there is plenty of emerging talent to be excited about
This was never going to be an Olympic Games quite like any other. The bike racing in Tokyo reflected that, and within that bubble so did the fortunes of Great Britain’s cyclists. It was a bizarrely apposite conclusion to a Games that had seen a string of one-off episodes on two wheels that Laura Kenny’s luck should run out in the cruellest style in the omnium, a discipline that she has made her own since its inception in 2012, while her husband Jason should become Britain’s most-crowned Olympian with a jaw-dropping gold medal in the keirin.
Sir Chris Hoy, the man Jason Kenny deposed as Olympic match sprint champion in 2012 after a fraught selection battle, compared his nemesis to a predatory big cat that spends most of its time asleep in the sun, turning into a ruthless apex predator at the flick of an eyelid. Kenny’s keirin opponents would concur that you cannot give the man a fraction of an iota of a glimpse of an opening.

The rules of New York City’s public swimming pools are stringent: no flotation aids, no coloured T-shirts, no food, no diving – and, most remarkably in this city of punitive cost, no charge. For the space of the summer, the 50-odd outdoor pools across the city’s five boroughs provide relief and recreation for thousands of New Yorkers – and something more nebulous, too. The locker rooms might be shabby, but every few years, when a local news outlet tests the water in a cross section of pools, the results are deeply satisfying and often the same. While the water in the city’s most expensive hotel pools is discovered to be teeming with germs, the public pools are almost always sparklingly clean.
This reminder of how good public services in the city can be feels particularly pertinent this summer, the second in a row of altered plans. If last year was the summer of reduced expectations – no one expected to go anywhere and made alternative local arrangements – this year is much choppier, with Covid rules changing seemingly every five minutes and travel plans being repeatedly cancelled. As a result, and by default, many of us have ended up doing something we might not have done for years, which is spending August in the city. New York, famously hostile to life in the summer, is suddenly a great place to be.

The Home Office has recorded 70 racist incidents by far-right supporters against asylum seekers in barracks and hotel accommodation, according to a freedom of information response obtained by the Guardian.
However, campaigners supporting asylum seekers in such accommodation say the figure is a significant underestimation of the true picture.

Britons vaccinated abroad are still struggling to get their jabs registered with the NHS, a Lib Dem peer has warned, despite government promises that measures would be in place by the end of last month.
Brian Paddick, a former London mayoral candidate and a member of the House of Lords, said the government was “yet again, promising things that they fail to deliver” after his GP was unable to register vaccinations he had in Norway, where he has been staying.

Team GB’s trailblazing performance in Tokyo has been hailed as “the greatest achievement in British Olympic history” after the young team matched the tally of medals from London 2012 on the final day.
With Jason Kenny successfully defending his keirin title to become the first Briton to win seven Olympic gold medals, and boxer Lauren Price also winning middleweight gold, the British team ended fourth in the medal table with 65 overall – 22 of them gold.

Deb Thea didn’t want a conventional wedding. “I was 70. Walking down the aisle? Wearing white? Come on!” she says. She wore a polka dot dress to marry her boyfriend, Tom Ford, who was 65. Her guests had polka dot ties, polka dot shawls and polka dot dresses.
Thea, who runs an antique shop in Petaluma, California, had always thought she would marry, but didn’t think it would take so long to find the right person. “I had boyfriends and I lived with people,” she says. “But we got to the point where we should go forward or stop, and they just didn’t seem enough to me.”

                    <span>Planting 10 saplings does not replace a twisted old oak. ‘Slow ecology’ is the only way to preserve and restore ancient habitats
We have a slow food movement and a slow travel movement. But we’re missing something, and its absence contributes to our escalating crisis. We need a slow ecology movement, and we need it fast.
The majority of the world’s species cannot withstand any significant disruption of their habitat by humans. Healthy ecosystems depend to a great extent on old and gnarly places, that might take centuries to develop, and are rich in what ecologists call “spatial heterogeneity”: complex natural architecture. They need, for example, giant trees, whose knotty entrails are split and rotten; great reefs of coral or oysters or honeycomb worms; braiding, meandering rivers full of snags and beaver dams; undisturbed soils reamed by roots and holes. The loss of these ancient habitats is one of the factors driving the global shift from large, slow-growing creatures to the small, short-lived species able to survive our onslaughts. Slow ecology would protect and create our future ancient habitats.

Team USA maintained their traditional place at the top of the Olympic medal table, although it took a late run of medals – and the help of a Welsh boxer – on the final day in Tokyo to lift them above China.
The US had entered Sunday with two fewer golds than China but victory for Jennifer Valente in the women’s omnium and a seventh successive title for the women’s basketball team – arguably the greatest dynasty in Olympic history – put the two countries level on 38 golds each. The Americans then edged ahead after they beat Brazil in the women’s volleyball final. China could have equalled the US gold tally in the women’s middleweight boxing final but Great Britain’s Lauren Price easily beat Li Qian on a points decision.

                    <span>The social media platform was once a favourite of artists and photographers, but a shift towards TikTok-type videos and shopping could leave them looking for a new home online
In late July, hobbyist photographer and self-proclaimed “sunrise hunter” Sam Binding conducted an experiment. After visiting Somerset Lavender Farm to catch the sun peeking over the purple blossoms, the 40-year-old from Bristol uploaded the results to both Instagram and Twitter. Two days later, he used the apps’ built-in analytics tools to assess the impact of his shots. On Instagram, a total of 5,595 people saw his post – just over half of his 11,000 followers. On Twitter, his post was seen by 5,611 people, despite the fact he has just 333 followers on the site.
This confirmed Binding’s hunch that although most people believe that Instagram is a place to share photos and Twitter is a place to share words, that may no longer be the case. When it launched in 2010, Instagram courted the artistic community, inviting respected designers to be among its initial users and naming its very first filter X-Pro II, after an analogue photo-developing technique. In her 2020 book No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram, technology reporter Sarah Frier documents how Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom wanted Instagram to be an outlet for artists (in a high-school essay, Systrom wrote that he liked how photography could “inspire others to look at the world in a new way”).

It’s a nightly summer ritual across much of Spain: as the sweltering heat of the day eases off, chairs are hauled out to the street for an alfresco chat. Now an enterprising village in southern Spain is seeking to have the tradition recognised by the United Nations as a cultural treasure.
The aim is to protect the centuries-old custom from the encroaching threat of social media and television, said José Carlos Sánchez, the mayor of Algar, a town of about 1,400 people. “It’s the opposite of social media,” he told the Guardian. “This is about face-to-face conversations.”

Beyond the plastic grass and polished concrete of King’s Cross’s Granary Square there is an unexpected enclave of trees. Step through a pair of tall wrought-iron gates salvaged from a vanished goods yard, and the grizzle of taxis and squeal of cornering trains is replaced by the unexpected song of a blackcap. City odours – of diesel and grilled meat – are superseded by a scent of damp earth and sickly sweet privet.
In the last decade, the post-industrial desolation behind London’s Kings Cross has been redeveloped and woven into an immaculate modern urban fabric of luxury office blocks and expensive boutiques. But the really priceless feature is a tatty explosion of greenery called Camley Street Natural Park.

Forget the feelgood factor. The warm glow generated by Team GB winning gold for three-day eventing or the modern pentathlon will quickly fade. Anybody who thinks sporting success will prompt a mini-economic boom is deluded.
That, though, doesn’t mean the Tokyo Olympics have no bearing on the economy and its performance. There are important lessons to be learned from how and why Great Britain’s athletes have gone from serial under-performers to globally competitive in the past 25 years.

She is halfway through compulsory quarantine, having just returned from filming the sci-fi series Raised By Wolves in South Africa. She’s had a bright and busy few years, bouncing from acclaimed dramas to blockbusters, via indie films and a Guy Ritchie caper, so it’s little wonder she’s happy to have a few days off. “I was saying to a friend last night, it’s kind of nice because no one’s able to get to you. It’s actually a nice decompression time.”
She has recently finished work on two particularly intense roles. In new four-part TV drama Deceit she plays the undercover officer known as “Lizzie James”, who took part in the doomed honeytrap Operation Edzell in an attempt to ensnare the killer of Rachel Nickell, the 23-year-old woman who was murdered on Wimbledon Common in 1992. “I wasn’t aware of the story, so I had to educate myself on that,” says Algar. The real “Lizzie James” has lifelong anonymity, but Algar talked to other undercover officers about their work, and spent a lot of time researching police in the early 90s.

For women at Activision Blizzard, one of the world’s most famous video game companies, showing up to work meant navigating near daily episodes of humiliation, sexual harassment, and even physical abuse, according to a bombshell lawsuit that has prompted a reckoning within the gaming industry.
The claims paint a disturbing picture of life for female employees: rampant sexual harassment, gender discrimination, retaliation, and a “frat boy” workplace culture where men objectified women’s bodies and openly joked about rape.

A multinational call centre used by dozens of leading UK companies has been criticised for what unions have called the intrusive monitoring of home-working staff and their families, as well as asking workers to hand over biometric and medical data.
Unions say Teleperformance, which also answers calls for a series of UK government departments, is “pushing workers’ boundaries” over long-term home working amid coronavirus, and accuse the company of having unfairly targeted several staff who objected.

First thing in the morning, while the kettle comes to the boil, I turn the fruits that have been slowly ripening on a white dish on the kitchen counter. Each fruit – a peach, an apricot or nectarine – gets a gentle squeeze with the whole hand (never a poke with a thumb – that I witness all too often in the shops) and, more importantly, a deep sniff. When ripe, the scent of the peaches is often reminiscent of roses. Smell rather than touch is often the best way to judge if they are ready to eat.

Each milestone usually means a celebration involving the entire town. The mayor, Mariano Carta, presents a medal to the centenarian, who more often than not can recall details of their life over the past century with remarkable lucidity.

Successive Tory-led governments have been accused of squandering the sporting legacy left by the 2012 Olympics in London, amid evidence that falling amounts of school time are being used for PE, and a third of children in several parts of England are active for less than 30 minutes a day.
Official figures show that the share of school hours spent on PE has suffered from a slow and steady decline since 2013, from 8.4% of school time to 7.7%. New figures also reveal that, heading into the pandemic, about a third of children and young people in London, the north-west, the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber were active for, on average, less than 30 minutes a day, according to Sport England.

Did the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen cultivate lagoons of urine in his rural Leicestershire constituency? In 2014, the Environment Agency claimed lagoons at the Measham depot of his vegetable packaging and distribution company, AB Produce, emitted a pervasive urine smell. “It smells just like urine all the time – first thing in the morning until last thing at night,” a villager said. By 2016, more than 400 people had complained about Bridgen’s urine lagoons, which he claimed contained liquefied vegetables; they were asked to score Bridgen’s odour from one (“very faint odour”) to six (“the strongest odour you could ever encounter, which could make you physically ill”). Though the issue was resolved, whenever the Conservatives need a stink, the Creature from the Yellow Lagoon can be relied upon to kick one up.
In February, Disney decided to flag, but not censor, dated content in old Muppet Shows. Viewers were warned, for example, that Johnny Cash sang in front of a Confederate battle flag, now blacklisted by American retailers after Confederate battle flag fan Dylann Roof shot dead nine black churchgoers in Charleston. Bridgen, a Tamagotchi Farage, mechanically declared: “I would like to know which bunch of muppets thought this one up… If this continues kids won’t be able to watch any TV programmes which are not newly made. Is nothing safe?” The shows, previously archived, were in fact newly available, with brief statements before contentious but unaltered episodes. It will soon be illegal to be white.

On a winter’s day in 1898, a stocky young man with a handlebar moustache was hurrying along the banks of a canal in Hamburg, north Germany. Franz Karl Bühler was in a panic, fleeing a gang of mysterious agents who had been tormenting him for months. There was only one way to escape, he thought. He must swim for it. So he plunged into the dark water, close to freezing at this time of year, and struck out for the far side. When he was hauled on to the bank, soaked and shivering, it became clear to passersby that there was something odd about the man. There was no sign of his pursuers. He was confused, perhaps insane. So he was taken to the nearby Friedrichsberg “madhouse”, as it was known then, and taken inside. He would remain in the dubious care of the German psychiatric system for the next 42 years, one of hundreds of thousands of patients who lived near-invisible lives behind the asylum walls.
Bühler’s incarceration disturbed him, but it also marked the beginning of a remarkable story, one in which he played a leading role. It reveals the debt art owes to mental illness, and the way that connection was used to wage history’s most destructive culture war.

In a stark warning about the potential number of children who have fallen “off grid” since the start of the pandemic, Anne Longfield said that tens of thousands more children could be exploited by gangs and criminals because the state had failed to keep track of them.

If All Souls is one of the most inordinately beautiful colleges in Oxford – its bone-white gothic, best peered at by mere mortals from nearby Radcliffe Square, is the work of the great Nicholas Hawksmoor – it’s also one of the oddest and most rarefied. Famously, it has no student body. Each year, however, a small number of recent graduates who would like to become so-called prize fellows may apply to take a famously difficult and inscrutable exam during which, as a tour guide I followed earlier put it, they must “write an essay on a single word, like coconut”. As my eavesdropping also revealed, TE Lawrence, AKA Lawrence of Arabia, passed this exam, but Harold Wilson failed it.
In her lovely, wood-panelled room in All Souls – its current tenant wears Adidas sneakers and likes a good martini, but it still makes me think of patched corduroy and sherry – Amia Srinivasan laughs heartily. “Right,” she says. “Those guides. They always come up with things like: everyone here is a priest, or everyone is a man. Or they tell people: ‘Stephen Hawking is in there right now.’ At least the exam thing is sort of true.” Having taken it successfully herself in 2009 – she had to write around the word “reproduction” – Srinivasan was a prize fellow at the college until 2016, when she became a lecturer at UCL (the one-word riff component was abandoned the following year). Now, though, she’s back. Last January, she took her up her post as the Chichele professor of social and political theory at All Souls, a job once held by Isaiah Berlin. She is both the first woman, and the first person of colour, to hold it. At just 36, she is also its youngest ever incumbent.

It feels like open season on Professor Neil Ferguson right now. Sections of the media and several columnists delight in castigating the epidemiologist, or “Professor Lockdown”, for being “doomster in chief”, constantly predicting catastrophe and then back-pedalling when the worst numbers don’t materialise.
Opponents of Covid restrictions blame Ferguson and his team at Imperial College London for persuading Boris Johnson to shake off his libertarian instincts and take us into lockdown. One presenter on new channel GB News described Ferguson as a “numpty” on air, and the very mention of his name attracts groans in some circles.

When more than 1,200 sketches, photographs and documents from the studio of Francis Bacon were donated to the Tate in 2004, it was described as one of the most generous gifts the gallery had ever received, estimated to be worth £20m. Now the donor is threatening to cancel the gift, accusing the gallery of reneging on pledges to stage exhibitions of the material.
Barry Joule, a longstanding friend of Bacon, had wanted the items to go to the Tate, as it had been the artist’s favourite gallery. Over the years, he kept expecting the Tate to do justice to it with an exhibition, as he says they had planned on accepting the gift. He wrote repeatedly to curatorial staff, asking when the show would happen.

Deep underground, scientists are closing in on one of the most elusive targets of modern science: dark matter. In subterranean laboratories in the US and Italy, they have set up huge vats of liquid xenon and lined them with highly sensitive detectors in the hope of spotting subatomic collisions that will reveal the presence of this elusive material.
However, researchers acknowledge that the current generation of detectors are reaching the limit of their effectiveness and warn that if they fail to detect dark matter with these types of machines, they could be forced to completely reappraise their understanding of the cosmos.

                    <span>From Slumdog’s quick-witted hero to a medieval warrior in The Green Knight, Dev Patel has always sought to be an everyman
Dev Patel was enjoying the ride, but people were saying the horse was too small. It was the winter of 2019. Patel was in Ireland, preparing for his latest film, The Green Knight, in which he spends long periods on horseback, slogging through wilderness. The Green Knight is directed by the American filmmaker David Lowery, who, while casting around, “got hooked on the magnificent image of Dev in armour, astride a horse,” he told me recently. The armour looked good in rehearsals, but the horse? “I was like, ‘Look! It’s amazing! Look how good I am!’” Patel recalls. “And then I’d watch the video back and be like, ‘OK, this is really embarrassing.’” The horse’s name was Sparkles. “She looked like a Shetland pony. I would sit on her and, literally, my toes would be scraping along the ground.” Eventually he was upgraded to a larger animal: “This wonderful horse called Armani. Real attitude. I’d steal apples from the hotel lobby and feed them to him.”
Patel, in a grey jumper, his dark hair pushed back, is speaking over Zoom from Adelaide, where he is staying with his girlfriend, the Australian actor Tilda Cobham-Hervey. We have been discussing his acting process, which he describes, glibly, as “90% panic, 10% it just happens.” “On my first day I got food poisoning,” he goes on. “Finally, after all this prep, Day One comes and I’m up this bloody mountain, it’s freezing cold, I’m swamped in armour and then…” He shakes his head. “I’m about to shit myself on this horse.” He had to return to his trailer, terrified he’d let everyone down, his neuroses firing. “David’s worried. All the producers are, like, ‘What’s going on? Who is this guy?’”

                    <span>Every year thousands of refugees from conflict, climate and instability in Africa board vessels in search of a new life in Europe but hundreds never arrive 
At 6.30am on Friday 28 May, three fishermen at work four miles off the southern coast of Tobago spotted a large white boat adrift on the dawn waters of the Caribbean.
As they drew closer, the trio saw the boat’s shape was far from local, and noticed a strong smell coming from inside it. The body the fishermen glimpsed at the bow was enough to confirm their suspicions. They called the coastguard who, unable to dispatch a vessel, asked them to tow the boat ashore at Belle Garden beach.

‘I am just over the moon, dream come true,’ says Welshwoman

As the unanimous judges’ decision was announced in her favour, exactly as she and everyone else knew it would be, Lauren Price used her first moments as an Olympic champion to point up to the sky and stare proudly above.
Price was thinking only of her grandfather. Along with her grandmother 27 years ago, Derek and Linda had taken her in at three days old after her biological parents gave her up. They provided her with the love and foundation that allowed her to thrive. Last December, having had dementia that robbed him of his vitality, he died.

In a sign of the tensions within the party over Corbyn’s suspension, figures on the left are circulating a change to Labour rules that would give members the final say over disciplinary action taken against MPs.

Nine months after the election he comprehensively lost, the spectre of Donald Trump – darkly menacing, subversive and apparently immune from prosecution – continues to cast a shadow over US democracy and America’s global standing, distorting policy and poisoning political life. How can this be? Why is this horror movie still running?
Trumpism, like other fascist variants, is a disease, a blight – a noxious far-right populist-nationalist miasma that taints and rots all it touches. Older Europeans share a folk memory of fascism. But too many Americans just don’t get it. The will to stamp out this sickness before it returns in more virulent form is alarmingly lacking.

Scroll down for a Q&amp;A with Richard Beard

I had a feeling I couldn’t immediately place. I wanted to go out but wasn’t allowed. Shelves were emptying at the nearest supermarket and instead of fresh fruit and vegetables I was eating British comfort food – sausages and mash, pie and beans. My freedom to make decisions like an adult was limited. I wondered when I’d see my mum again.
March 2020, first week of the first lockdown: I was 53 years old and felt like I was back at boarding school. Which wouldn’t have mattered, but for the fact that at a time of national crisis my generation of boarding-school boys found themselves in charge.

Japan broke two records last week. On Thursday, the day its athletes took their medal haul to a level not seen in the country’s Olympic history, the host city reported 5,042 coronavirus cases – the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.
Japan has continued to widen the gap between its Tokyo 2020 medal count and Rio, where it won 41. Now, with 56, it is third in the overall table behind China and the US on the eve of the closing ceremony.

How does Sunday start? With a gasp as I wake up, followed by that relief of remembering I’ve no work commitments. I try to lie in until 9am, then make a fresh ginger and lemon drink; clear and cleansing. I’ll pop to the local bakery and luxuriate in my treats. And Radio 4 is on, as it remains all morning.
Do you work? We tend not to film, but there’s always Monday morning. I’ll often punctuate Sundays by reading scripts, but somehow I don’t mind it. I’m not great at working in concentrated spurts, I’m best in bite-size pieces: a half hour stint followed by a croissant suits me.

Brown foods are the best. We know this. Brown foods are about caramelised sugars and the Maillard reaction; they’re hefty flavours, emphasised and accentuated. They conjure images of prehistoric campfires and the lick of the flame before the lick of the tongue. So much about Brighton’s Burnt Orange, which opened in June, is calculated to trigger these lustful, crisped and crispy thoughts. The name was given to a shade of orange in 1915 and is, say web sources I’ve decided to trust, designed to evoke thoughts of leaping flames.

The other, who is older than me and gay (and my half-brother), has recently gone abroad with his partner and had two children via a surrogate, with both fathers having had a biological child each.
I’ve always supported people’s rights in principle, especially gay rights, yet this has opened a chasm of sadness in me, not having had children. It also makes me feel like the odd one out among my siblings as they are both now busy with their respective families.

When the Great Plague struck Marseille in 1720, killing more than half of the city’s population, travellers were ordered to carry a “bill of health” and ships arriving at the Mediterranean port underwent a 40-day cordon sanitaire or quarantine. As a gateway for trade, the city authorities struggled to find a delicate balance between halting the spread of the disease and damaging vital commerce.
Three hundred years on, President Emmanuel Macron is walking an equally tricky tightrope just eight months before he seeks re-election in April 2022. And unlike the ancient Marseillais, Macron has to answer to social media.

Jason Kenny has become Britain’s most decorated Olympian after winning gold in the men’s keirin at Tokyo 2020, a victory that has put on hold talk of an end to his glittering career on the track.
Kenny, who conceded he was “struggling” during the men’s sprint earlier in the week, now has seven golds, one more than his fellow keirin specialist Sir Chris Hoy. Those, plus two silvers, have also taken him past Sir Bradley Wiggins, who is on eight medals.

Five teenage boys have been killed in a car crash in New Zealand’s worst road accident for two years.
The tragedy occurred in Washdyke, just north of Timaru halfway between Christchurch and Dunedin, when an overcrowded Nissan Bluebird car struck a power pole, killing every passenger on board.

The sheriff of Albany county, New York, on Saturday repeatedly referred to a woman who filed a criminal complaint against Governor Andrew Cuomo, following her allegation of sexual misconduct, as a victim and touted her bravery in coming forward.
“I think we’ve all read the attorney general’s report, I think we all know what’s in it,” Sheriff Craig Apple told reporters during a press conference in the state capital on Saturday, adding: “At this point, I’m very comfortable and safe saying she’s in fact a victim.”

The waiting list for NHS care in England could rise to 15 million people in the next four years without a significant increase in its current capacity, ministers are warned, amid a cabinet clash over the service’s future funding.
With senior figures inside the health service warning there is currently “a chasm” between the NHS and the Treasury over the financial settlement now needed, exclusive analysis seen by the Observer shows that NHS trusts in England are on course to spend almost £5bn more next financial year than was anticipated when Theresa May set the service’s funding levels in 2018.

One abducted girl from the Nigerian town of Chibok has been freed and reunited with her parents seven years after Boko Haram militants kidnapped her and more than 200 of her classmates, Borno state’s governor said on Saturday.
The raid on the school in the north-eastern town one night in April 2014 sparked an international outcry and a viral campaign on social media with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls.

Heavy downpours caused flooding in areas of London on Saturday, and the Met Office warned that torrential rain would continue to affect the south-east of England throughout the day.

                    <span>Community Shield may be an irrelevance, but the FA Cup holders at least made the best of their day out at Wembley
As a fundraiser it is a worthy event, even in a half-full stadium. But the Community Shield as a contest and spectacle is mostly worthless, especially when one of the teams – in this case Manchester City – deploys a skeletal side because many of their players are making their way back from tournaments that matter to them. Even its symbolic value as a curtain raiser feels forced, like new socks on Father’s Day, something no one particularly wants but most accept out of politeness. A rethink of the format is in order. Or the teams could just make a donation to good causes and save everyone the bother of turning up for a half-speed chore in a cluttered schedule.
It was not always like this. It used to be worse . . . and then for a while better. When Spurs won the Double in 1961, they could not play themselves in the Charity Shield so instead faced an England XI. That would not have been an option this year because England’s players – with the exception of Jack Grealish, apparently – are still working their way back from Euro 2020. When Arsenal did the Double in 1971, they shirked the Charity Shield altogether, so Leicester got to play in it for the first time on the basis that they had won the Second Division. Manchester City’s appearance the following year seemed even more random: after the league champions, Derby County, and the FA Cup winners, Leeds United, decided they could not bear to face each other, City were called up because, well, they had finished fourth in the league, and they faced Aston Villa, who had won Division Three.

The Taliban have captured a second provincial capital in Afghanistan a day after they took over the south-western financial hub of Zaranj, as the insurgent group continued to advance in urban parts of the country.
Taliban fighters armed with heavy weapons overran the strategic city of Sheberghan, the capital of the northern Jawzjan province, on Saturday afternoon. The city was considered a stronghold of the notorious Afghan warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is believed to be in Kabul after returning to Afghanistan this week following medical treatment in Turkey.

Rebekah Campbell remembers the moment she knew things had to change. “I got to age 34 and woke up one Christmas morning on a fold-out bed in the garage of some friends of my parents and was like, ‘I don’t want to live the rest of my life like this,’” she says. “I could see that I was potentially going to miss out on having a family unless I did something drastic.”
Campbell was single and had not been on a date since the death of her boyfriend a decade prior. In those 10 years, she focused her energy on building a successful business career, including founding the order-ahead app Hey You. So she resolved to begin dating the same way she launched brands: by sketching out a plan that resembled the “sales funnel” she used in her work.

In 1922, Cyril Jerrard captured the first and only photographs of the paradise parrot, the only Australian bird to be officially declared extinct since European colonisation. Jerrard was well aware he was looking at one of the last of its kind: “The one undisguisable fact [is] that the advent of the white man has spelled destruction to one of the loveliest of the native birds of this country,” he wrote in 1924.
The last accepted sighting of a paradise parrot – also by Jerrard – was in 1927, near Gayndah in the Burnett River district of southern Queensland.

His overall approval rating has fallen to -16, down from the -13 he recorded two weeks ago and -8 a fortnight before that. It is even lower than the -15 he recorded back in January, when Britain was in the grip of a Covid peak, lockdown measures were in place and the NHS was under severe pressure.

                    <span>The city is surrounded by flames. On the ground, there are tales of heroism – and fear for the future
Little had prepared any of us on the Athens-bound flight for the sight of the great fire-induced clouds that swept either side of the plane as it made its descent on Friday.
News of the extreme heat engulfing Greece had spread beyond its borders all week, packaged in increasingly desperate language. Temperatures were breaking records few had ever imagined. If Monday was bad, then Tuesday was worse. In some parts of the country, the mercury had hit 47C (117F), with thermal cameras on drones recording the ground temperature in downtown Athens at 55C.

                    <span>Tottenham striker has been criticised but he has a right to be selfish – and to question the club’s inaction over past two years
The tendency always is to oversimplify, to try to find one person to blame: if only he had acted better, if only he had done his job properly. But it is rarely about that – or rarely just about that. The agency of individuals should not be denied. Harry Kane and Daniel Levy have played their parts in the continuing saga of the forward’s proposed move to Manchester City. But this is also about wider economic forces.
Over the past week or so the majority of the focus has been on Kane. Already there is a sense his reputation has been sullied by the saga, distaste at his reluctance to train heightened by the fact that he is the England captain – as though wearing the armband meant that, like Billy Wright and Caesar’s wife, he must be above suspicion.

India need 157 more runs with nine wickets in hand

The turmoil of the past few weeks could easily have dampened Joe Root’s natural spark but on a gripping fourth day in Nottingham, one that saw the pendulum swing throughout and finished with India in the ascendancy, the England captain delivered his 21st Test century and one that must rank among the finest of his career.
As Root punched India’s Shardul Thakur down the ground for four shortly after tea, the ball cruising across the green outfield, he didn’t even wait for it to cross the rope. Instead the 30-year-old could be seen haring off in celebration of his first Test hundred on home soil in nearly three years and his fourth in what is proving a bumper 2021.

                    <span>Third Test: South Africa 19-16 British &amp; Irish Lions
Morne Steyn comes off bench to score winning penalty 

They do not come much more tense than this. Nor, from a British &amp; Irish Lions perspective, do they come any more gut-wrenching. For the second time this century South Africa have clinched a Lions series by the tiniest of margins via the boot of Morné Steyn, who popped up with a penalty goal in the 79th minute to break the tourists’ hearts, just as he did in Pretoria in 2009.
What a crushing disappointment for them, what a desperate sense of deja vu. At least it was a compelling finale to restore neutral faith in rugby at the end of a fractious series. The momentum swung repeatedly in one direction and then the other after Cheslin Kolbe’s 56th-minute try had threatened to kill the contest.

                    <span>Which country boasts the best athletes on the planet? Well, it depends on who you ask – and how you measure success
As of this writing, the United States leads the medal count in the Tokyo Olympics. Or maybe it’s China. Or San Marino.
It all depends on how you choose to list the medals, and it’s surprisingly contentious. Let’s take the 2016 Olympics as an example. A British supporter would have preferred that the medals were listed in order of gold medals won – that put them in second place with 27 golds ahead of China in third 26. A fan of the Chinese would have been happier if credit was given to total medals, where their team finished with 70 – three ahead of Team GB’s 67. The media in the US tend to count total medals, whereas the rest of the world generally favors gold. Some would say it’s no coincidence that the US tends to do better in the latter method as it nearly always fields the largest number of athletes.

Government censured for gaffe after gaffe in run-up to Cop26

The world will soon face “catastrophe” from climate breakdown if urgent action is not taken, the British president of vital UN climate talks has warned.
Alok Sharma, the UK minister in charge of the Cop26 talks to be held in Glasgow this November, told the Observer that the consequences of failure would be “catastrophic”: “I don’t think there’s any other word for it. You’re seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.”

In the video to her multi-platinum hit single Truth Hurts, Lizzo gets married to herself. She walks herself down the aisle. She slow-dances by herself in a lacy white dress, kicking a balloon out of her path. She feeds herself cake, messily, by hand. “Why a man great ’til he gotta be great?” she asks, deadpan, straight to camera. Then she raises a toast.
Lizzo’s lyrics of self-love are the stuff of motivational posters, her confidence-boosting songs the anthem to a million messy nights out. Her quick wit and warm, generous relatability have made her a global icon – that, and her ability to bring down the house. Crowned Time magazine’s 2019 Entertainer of the Year, Lizzo  can put on a show that is by many accounts a life-changing experience. Just ask Rihanna, who has been seen giving her a lengthy standing ovation. After all, who else can twerk and play the flute quite like Lizzo?

“I don’t want to create false hopes,” Joan Laporta said, but that was all they had left. Barcelona’s president had been explaining the reasons why they could no longer keep Lionel Messi, offering a portrait of bankruptcy partly created by the pursuit of hopes that were not real, the consequences of calamitous management at the club, when he was asked the question some inevitably clung to. More than once, in fact. What if?
What if there was still a way to fix this? What if there was a shot at salvation, some way back? A sale, a loophole in the laws, a new deal. Couldn’t you just push a player out? Someone, anyone, just not him. There was still time, wasn’t there? What if the league realised what they, too, were about to lose and let go a little; made an exception? If Messi produced some grand gesture? Maybe even played for free? Laporta had said Messi was sad, that he wanted to stay. So stay.

                    <span>Hungary’s leader and Fox News are natural bedfellows in peddling paranoia politics
Tucker Carlson is not much to look at. A little man with a face screwed into the scowl of a junior manager passed over for promotion, you might walk by him in the street with barely a glance. Only when he describes how “the elite has turned against its own people” should you take notice. Carlson is the dependable voice of the dominant force on the right that will destroy democracy in the name of “the people”.
Last week, Carlson’s Fox News beamed an admiring show from Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, even though there is every indication that Orbán will make it Europe’s first rightwing dictatorship since the fall of Franco’s Spain in 1975. Fox News built its audience and Orbán built his power by creating paranoid fears of an enemy so dangerous, any tactics can be justified to defeat it. Usually, it is the globalised liberal elite that turns against its own people by allowing mass immigration. Orbán has added a fascistic twist to the great replacement conspiracy theory by blaming the Jewish financier George Soros for plotting to flood Christian Hungary with Muslims. If it is not migrants, it is the gay men he implies are paedophiles, and if it is not gay men, it is the European Union. The name of the enemy is incidental. The point about modern far-right politics is that there must always be an enemy.

As the final whistle blew at the end of 120 airless minutes, after six games in 17 days, and at the end of an 11-month season with barely a caesura of rest, the players of Brazil and Spain collapsed in contrasting states of delirium.
For Brazil’s men’s Olympic football team this was a night that ended in career-high joy for many of those present. The gold medal was secured via an extra-time goal from the vibrant, game-changing Malcom, who plays his football in the Russian Olympic Committee Premier League with Zenit Saint Petersburg.

In the minutes after the end of the very last event, an army of construction workers filed into the Olympic Stadium to start getting it ready for the closing ceremony. The athletes were still making their way out through the line of TV, radio and press interviews while the workers were marching past them, hauling palettes of stacked plastic matting to lay over the track and great rolls of fabric to unwrap. The Olympics are winding down, and the athletics is wrapping up. Looking back on what’s happened here in the last nine days, you can see the ways in which the Games have started to change.
The most keenly anticipated race of these Olympics wasn’t the men’s 100m but the women’s, and the biggest stars of the athletics championships were Elaine Thompson-Herah, who swept all three sprints, and Sifan Hassan, who completed an unprecedented treble when she followed her victory in the 5,000m and her bronze in the 1,500m with another gold medal in the 10,000m. And then there was Allyson Felix, who says she has enjoyed every minute of it.

                    <span>The novelist on making Philip Larkin his fictional father, why writing has become a battle, and his new work about race in the US
Martin Amis, 71, is the author of 15 novels, two story collections and seven works of nonfiction, including a memoir, Experience. His latest book, Inside Story, out in paperback, is a “novelised autobiography”, loosely centred on the narrator’s affair with an escort named Phoebe Phelps. The New York Times called it an “unstable and charismatic compound of fact and fiction... that includes some of Amis’s best writing to date”. He spoke to me over the phone from his home in Brooklyn, where he has lived since 2011 with his wife, the writer Isabel Fonseca.
Why did you conceive Inside Story as a novel rather than a straight sequel to Experience?
It’s a very solipsistic book – to make it interesting to write, I needed to give the imagination some play. Phoebe Phelps is in some ways an anthology of women I’ve known, but she’s 100% made up.
The narrative turns on a letter, sent on 12 September 2001, in which Phoebe says your father isn’t Kingsley Amis but Philip Larkin...
I had to cook up an identity crisis for myself – I’ve never really had one – and I thought it had to be seismic, as September 11 was. If you’re my age, you had the cold war, but nothing that involved oneself personally, as September 11 did involve everyone personally, in the psychological sense, in the emotional sense. I felt that discovering that someone else was your father would roughly correspond to those feelings of having to doubt everything you had previously assumed.

There is a tattoo on Ivan Toney’s torso depicting a tiger staring back at a kitten that is looking at its reflection in a puddle. As the Brentford striker has learned over the years, mentality is king. “It shows it doesn’t matter how others see you,” he says. “If you see yourself as a winner, you’re going to be a winner, you’re going to make sure you become a winner. If you see yourself as fearless, you’ll be fearless. I think that goes far, not just in football but in everything. If you want to achieve something, it doesn’t matter what others think, you have got to make sure you achieve it.”
Five years on from his last Premier League appearance – Toney’s top-flight experience consists of two cameos as a teenage substitute for Newcastle in 2015-16, the second against Manchester United – he is set to lead the line when Brentford entertain Arsenal on Friday, adamant the “big boys” do not scare them. “All I remember is giving the ball away and United nearly scoring in that game. I was not involved again after that,” he says, with a booming chuckle.

Returning to the stage is like “getting in a hot bath”, Peter Kay said at a special charity gig.
The Bolton-born comic received a standing ovation as he appeared on stage at the Apollo, Manchester, for the first of two live Q&amp;As on Saturday.

                    <span>The singer outshone her modern rivals in a survey of the vocabulary of lyrics
A recent study by the online search tool Wordtips assessed the number of unique words used in the lyrics of 100 music “legends” and 100 modern pop stars. (Rappers were excluded as they had their own survey a few years ago and the result showed that they are, to use the scientific term, extremely wordy.)
It found that Patti Smith has the largest vocabulary, clocking up 217 unique words per 1,000, more than her closest rivals in lyrical complexity, Joni Mitchell and Björk. Smith was a writer and a poet before she was a rock star, so it is perhaps unsurprising that she has an interest in the more curious corners of language.

                    <span>It’s been a white-knuckle ride, but we’re finally off to France subject to our Covid ‘declaration of honour’
Like many people, I’ve spent a lot of this year playing the great new game of holiday roulette, a wild ride that began for me in January, when a group of us, convinced that foreign travel would be possible again by the summer, booked a house in rural France. So many times, we almost cancelled. So many times, I wondered if our nerve would hold. On Thursday, however, our uncommon steeliness/wilful stupidity paid off. France returned to the amber list. Time for the casino to pay up.
Only then a new game began: the struggle to organise all the stuff you now need to cross international borders. The French government’s requirement that travellers sign a “declaration of honour” promising they have no Covid symptoms makes me laugh; it reminds me, somehow, of the notes small children write, in which they sombrely announce to their parents that they’ll “tidie my bedroom soon” or do their homework “if I can have a Nintendo Switch”. But the business of booking Covid tests is the opposite of funny. While there are hundreds of “government-approved” companies out there, it seems that many turn out to be strangely uncontactable when their kits fail to turn up. In the end, I went with the site with the most vaguely scientific-sounding name and was duly rewarded with a surprisingly warm email from “Dr Tom Stubbs and the Chronomics team”. Fingers (and test tubes) crossed.

                    <span>An unexpected friendship was a breath of fresh air after my turbulent city life
Much is said about walking the road less travelled. There’s joy in the unexpected and the unravelling of, well, who knows what. Just over a year ago, I left my London life for rural Wales. I saw it as not a desirable but a necessary pause in what had become a turbulent life. The previous six years had been full of turmoil, death, subsequent grief and estrangement. Before my big move, I ran away for a month to New York, to spend time on my own. I spent the days writing and watching a blur of people rotate in the world as I tried to find my place in it. I had become deeply sad. 
Walking has never been my thing, but there’s no point in being in the countryside if you’re not going to try it out. So I bought a pair of expensive walking boots and made it my goal to put one foot in front of the other. Which is how I came to meet Wilf, a farmer in his 70s. Most days when I would go out I would see him tending to his sheep. It was a wholesome sight, a shepherd with his flock. There was something eternal about it, a man toiling the earth, as if this one scope held all of eternity. It made everything else look so starkly ephemeral.

                    <span>When the British painter Alison Jones met her Ithacan husband, it felt like destiny. “I am obsessed with Greece, heroes and enchantresses, spells and metamorphoses,” she says. Her destiny has the added benefit of an annual holiday on Ithaca, at her husband’s family home. “I find the Greeks’ relaxed ways at the beach eye-opening – even grandmothers rock bikinis and oversize sunglasses. They take pleasure in their bodies in a way that I, as a northerner accustomed to camping holidays, found quite startling.” 
Her friends loved the sketches when she shared them on Instagram. “I think lockdown made the glamorous location and delight in bodies out promenading especially appealing.”

Bahrain’s Kalkidan Gezahegne takes silver medal

Sifan Hassan’s odyssey from refugee to one of the greatest athletes of this or any other era was confirmed in Tokyo as she became the first person to win three medals over 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m.
The last leg of the treble, after 5,000m gold and 1,500m bronze, came as the Dutch athlete sprinted clear of Bahrain’s Kalkidan Gezahegne to win the 10,000m in 29min 55.32sec, with Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia, the world record holder, winning bronze. It made Hassan the second woman to earn a medal in three individual track races at one Olympics. The other was also a Dutchwoman – Fanny Blankers-Koen, a mother of two who was known as the Flying Housewife, who won her three at the London Olympics in 1948.

It is a fraught and dangerous time to be a Belarusian activist or dissident abroad, where the scrambling of a MiG-29 to ground a Ryanair plane, the abortive “kidnapping” of an Olympic sprinter and a possible “murder disguised as suicide” in Ukraine have been met darkly by the growing community of Belarusian exiles.
“Considering the events in Kyiv, I want to tell people that I have no suicidal tendencies,” wrote Andrej Stryzhak, a Belarusian activist currently in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, in a post on Facebook last week. “We have heightened our security measures and no matter what situation develops, we will continue our work.”

It has been reported that the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) condemned the Home Office for producing an “unethical” website aimed at deterring people from attempting to seek refuge in the UK.

                    <span>(Whirlwind)
The young New Yorker’s beautifully poised delivery is backed by a trio led by the virtuosic guitar of Pasquale Grasso
Samara Joy is 21, and two years ago she won the Sarah Vaughan international jazz vocal competition. She grew up in a gospel-singing family in New York, and it was college friends who first introduced her to the great jazz singers such as Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, along with their vast repertoire of classic American song. Joy fell for it all, and seems instinctively to have grasped the main features of the singing style – rhythmic freedom, clear diction, avoidance of mannerisms etc.
Her approach is simple but beautifully poised, and when she does take off on an improvised passage or coda, the trickiest notes present no problem. The album cover lists 12 tracks, but there are actually 13, and that last one, Sophisticated Lady, is the best of the lot for me – delicately phrased and full of feeling. The accompaniment is by a trio led by Pasquale Grasso, a guitarist with the most phenomenal technique and an endless flow of ideas. It’s impressive, if a bit much at times for the job in hand. So, two young artists keeping a classic style alive with love, understanding and, in Grasso’s case, bravura.

Bloody Difficult Women will even suggest that their similar characteristics and experiences – both are diligently hard workers and share a love of cricket – could have made them friends if they had not been political opponents over parliament’s say over Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.

The new rules championed by the president, Emmanuel Macron, make it obligatory to either be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, be in possession of a negative test or be recently recovered from the virus to enjoy usually routine activities.

This weekend, the English seaside destination more often associated with sandcastles, retirement and the “Costa packet” villas of Sandbanks has become home to some of the most disconcerting and challenging artworks in Britain.
A vast new gallery inside a former department store launched on Saturday with a show featuring the bronze suicide vests of controversial artists Jake and Dinos Chapman and provocative work of other British conceptual and alternative artists, such as Jim Lambie, Banksy, Gavin Turk, Kacey Wong and Jeremy Deller.

                    <span>Damon plays a man trying to extricate his daughter from the French penal system, with help from Call My Agent!’s Camille Cottin
Construction worker Bill (Matt Damon) travels from Oklahoma to Marseille to visit his twentysomething daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin), who is five years into a nine-year prison sentence for the murder of her girlfriend. Her lawyer considers the case closed, but Dad is convinced of her innocence and so takes matters into his own hands. (Sound familiar? Amanda Knox has criticised the film’s similarity to her own experience with the European justice system. Yet it’s hardly a biopic, instead using her story as more of an igniting incident.
Directed by Oscar-winner Tom McCarthy (Spotlight), this is a thoughtful, knotty character study, albeit one nestled inside a polished, and less interesting, action thriller. Those expecting Damon – practically incognito beneath a scruffy beard and trucker hat – to Jason Bourne his little girl out of jail will find themselves surprised to see Bill spending most of the film gently Eat-Pray-Loving around France’s oldest city with his do-gooder neighbour turned unofficial translator, Virginie (Call My Agent!’s Camille Cottin, her hard-nosed comic persona swapped for a softer touch).

Coronavirus – latest updates

Prof Francois Balloux is director of the University College London Genetics Institute. His work focuses on the reconstruction of disease outbreaks and epidemics. With his colleague Dr Lucy van Dorp, he led the first large-scale sequencing project of the Sars-CoV2 genome. During the pandemic, he has become a prominent scientist on Twitter, where he describes himself as a “militant corona centrist”.
Would you say a new variant of concern is still the major threat to our way out of this pandemic?
We haven’t had one in a while. The four variants of concern all emerged in the second half of 2020, and it’s important to keep in mind that viruses evolve all the time at a fairly regular pace.

James Spears “has dutifully and faithfully served as the conservator of his daughter’s estate without any blemishes on his record,” his filing said.

No country competing at Tokyo 2020 has welcomed the return of the madison to the fold with more enthusiasm than Team GB. A day after Katie Archibald and Laura Kenny won gold in the discipline’s first Olympic event for women, Matt Walls and Ethan Hayter dug deep to take silver in the men’s race – making its first appearance since 2008 on Saturday.
Gold went to the world champions, the Danish pairing of Lasse Norman Hansen and Michael Morkov, while France’s Benjamin Thomas and Donavan Grondin took bronze after Hayter’s tie-breaking sprint right at the death of the 200-lap race.

My first memory is my mother [folk singer Kate McGarrigle] singing to me. It was the song Go Tell Aunt Rhody, which is about a goose dying and the gander being depressed. Very morbid. I was very little. I remember her hand softly caressing my arm while she sang it to me. It’s a lovely memory. It’s a sad song, even a scary one. But it was comforting.
I’m still grieving for my mother. I’m very much in it. She’s been gone over 10 years now, but I wear a lot of her clothes, I live in the house she lived in and I sing her songs. Her dying at 63 has defined me in lots of ways. I was only 33 when I lost her. But this year I’ve been thinking about it differently. Dying young means that you’re saved years of old age. There’s a lot of suffering in old age. That’s been helping me to think like that.

With six breathless rounds all but completed Cao Yuan of China, a gold medallist in 2012 and 2016, needed a stellar final effort to reclaim top spot from his countryman, Yang Jian, who had just produced a jaw-dropping forward four and a half somersaults pike, the most difficult dive in the competition.

Competition for places is expected to be fierce because teacher-assessed grades, which have replaced exams cancelled by the pandemic, are predicted to result in grade inflation, with higher marks awarded than usual, meaning more students will meet their offers.

                    <span>Trump’s team reportedly believed that coronavirus would hurt Democratic states – and Democratic governors – worse. But the virus does not discriminate
Some of the most powerful conservatives in the United States have, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, chosen to sow disinformation along with mockery and distrust of proven methods of combating the disease, from masks to vaccines to social distancing. Their actions have afflicted the nation as a whole with more disease and death and economic crisis than good leadership aligned with science might have, and, in spite of hundreds of thousands of well-documented deaths and a new surge, they continue. Their malice has become so normal that its real nature is rarely addressed. Call it biological warfare by propaganda.
Call Jared Kushner the spiritual heir of the army besieging the city of Caffa on the Black Sea in 1346, which, according to a contemporaneous account, catapulted plague-infected corpses over the city walls. This is sometimes said to be how the Black Death came to Europe, where it would kill tens of millions of people – a third of the European population – over the next 15 years. A Business Insider article from a year ago noted: “Kushner’s coronavirus team shied away from a national strategy, believing that the virus was hitting Democratic states hardest and that they could blame governors.” An administration more committed to saving lives than scoring points could have contained the pandemic rather than made the US the worst-hit nation in the world. Illnesses and casualties could have been far lower, and we could have been better protected against the Delta variant.

Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose initial modelling helped shape Britain’s coronavirus response, has said future lockdowns are unlikely to be needed to control the spread of the disease in the UK.
However, the government scientific adviser warned that Covid case numbers could rise again and his prediction could change if the virus “changes substantially”.

Unusually for someone who presented TV and radio programmes for six decades, Jimmy Savile is most significantly represented in the archives by shows he didn’t host. In When Louis Met Jimmy (BBC Two, 2000), Louis Theroux raised questions about longstanding rumours of paedophilia, which were rebuffed but later certified by Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile (ITV, 2012). Screened after the broadcaster’s death, that film triggered institutional investigations concluding he had sexually abused at least 450 people, 80% of whom were young people and children.
The 10th anniversary of Savile’s death in October will greatly add to the TV credits the presenter wouldn’t want to have. Discovery’s Jimmy Savile: The People Who Knew is the first; a Netflix two-parter is due later this year and a BBC docudrama, The Reckoning, is also in production. (Disclosure: I witnessed, and reported to the BBC, an assault by Savile on a BBC staff member in 2006, as recorded in the Dame Janet Smith report of 2016. I was interviewed for the Netflix films.)

                    <span>West Essex: I spot a ladybird in the bush in our garden. But wait! there’s something strange about it
It’s a mild, sunny day and I’m helping in the garden – which means keeping everyone company and chatting away, like the pretty robin that always comes looking for a treat whenever somebody is gardening. The incessant twitter of birds and their young can be heard from the hedge, and there is a sweet scent coming from one of the bushes. A tiny red spot stands out among the different shades of green. It is a ladybird, but hold on! Something is strange about it.
As the little beetle tries to scuttle away on its tiny legs, I pick it up gently and place it on a leaf to take a closer look. It’s a seven-spot ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata), about the size of a small pea. Oddly, one wing is orange and the other is red! Couldn’t nature make up its mind? Or does this fellow have two different parents – one red, one orange? Or maybe it broke its left wing and therefore lost the bright red colour. Either way, this ladybird is very special. Carefully, tenderly, I place it under the rose bush, where a feast of aphids awaits.

                    <span>South Wales: It’s summer time and our gooseberry bush is full of fruit (and thorns)
The gooseberries are growing again. In Welsh they are called eirin Mair, berries of Mary, or “Mary berry” as my dad says. This year we collected about 200 of them from the bush in our small garden, about the same as last summer in lockdown. The ones we grow are green and have small spiky hairs on them which look strange. They taste really sharp when you eat them. We’ve made quite a few gooseberry fools with yoghurt, cream and icing sugar. It is one of my favourite desserts. I have also made gooseberry ice-cream.
I scratch myself on the thorns of the bush quite a lot when picking them. Once after I did that, I wrote a short story about gooseberries causing an illness around the world when you ate them. Scientists later find a cure which involves getting a deep scratch from the gooseberry bush thorns. Everyone got cured, but it took a long time for people to queue at the various locations where we have gooseberry bushes.

It could have been a John Grisham novel set in the Chicago of yesteryear. Apsana Begum, Britain’s first hijab-wearing MP, was acquitted last week of three counts of housing fraud in a failed prosecution by her own Tower Hamlets council.
Nobody involved in pursuing this trial seems to have found it remotely odd that the complaint was made by the brother-in-law of Begum’s ex-husband – the ex-husband himself being a councillor in a position of political oversight. The jury found Begum not guilty of all charges; in the eyes of her detractors, Begum’s true crime may have been that she was a leftwing Muslim female MP.

A German modern pentathlon coach has been thrown out of the Tokyo Olympics for punching a horse during competition.
Kim Raisner was trying to assist German athlete Annika Schleu as she battled to control Saint Boy ahead of her show jumping round in the women’s event on Friday. Athletes are given only 20 minutes to bond with an unfamiliar horse before their round and Schleu, who had been leading the field, was in tears as she came into the ring.

Well, not quite top because you also managed to signal the end of BTecs (a disaster in the making). Perhaps you were using your Latin splash to hide that announcement.
You’re also keeping very quiet about what is happening with the GCSE marking – the results only days away for my offspring. I can’t work out which is going to be more exciting: hearing his results or listening to your convoluted explanations as to why a) this year’s teacher assessment method was perfect and b) why – even though it’s been perfect – we’ll all have to go back next year to the one-off, high-stakes, unnecessary obstacle of GCSEs.

Manicured sales assistants, testing pots and makeovers are being replaced by powerful influencers and digital beauty halls that can switch up the products on offer at the tweak of an algorithm.

‘I’m Olympic champion now, it sounds crazy,’ says Briton

If ever there was a measure of how well Galal Yafai had managed the most important, pressure-filled moment of his career so far, it came in the immediate seconds after the third round of his final bout. He had played his hand so perfectly, dominant in the opening two rounds and then calm in the last, that as soon as it was over he already knew. Everyone knew. Yafai walked back to his corner with a rare, beaming smile across his face: “Oh, mate,” he said. “Wow.”
Moments later, what every single inhabitant of the sparsely populated Ryogoku Kokukigan already knew was confirmed. Yafai is the Olympic champion, victor in the flyweight division after a wonderfully crafted performance to see off Carlo Paalam of the Philippines. He is Great Britain’s first boxing gold medalist in Tokyo in a tournament that has produced the country’s highest total of Olympic medals in the sport – six – since Antwerp 1920.

Women’s golf: Another birdie for Lydia Ko and she’s -4 for the round after just five holes! The New Zealander was five shots off USA’s Nelly Korda for the lead at the start of the day, and now that gap is just two. And now India’s Aditi Ashok hits a birdie, bringing her level with Ko.

Tottenham have rejected City’s £100m bid for the England captain and Guardiola admitted the deal is “finished” should the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, refuse to negotiate.
Kane is desperate to join the Premier League champions and is trying to force a move. City remain in the market for “maybe one more” major signing according to their manager, who said the Grealish deal was possible only after raising £60m in sales.

Barcelona president explains why Messi deal was impossible

Paris Saint-Germain are closing in on a deal to sign Lionel Messi after making progress in negotiations with the forward’s representatives. The club have been pushing for the Argentina international since Thursday, when Barcelona announced he would be leaving. Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, is expected in Paris to talk directly over a contract that will be valid until June 2023 with an option to extend the agreement. PSG are now confident they can bring the 34-year-old to Paris.
Talks are focused on ensuring any deal stays within the boundaries of financial fair play, and agreeing a contract length and salary. Messi had accepted a substantial pay cut to about €20m a season to stay at Barcelona but his deal was due to run for five years, ending just after he turns 39.

                    <span>The fly-half says Warren Gatland’s side must avoid getting bogged down as they did in the second Test
The bigger the game the more Dan Biggar likes it. Nor does anyone need to tell him what the Lions must seek to do if they intend to win the all-important third Test. “We’re very much aware we’ve got to fire a few more shots than we did last weekend,” says the fly-half whose tactical decisions will be pivotal to the series outcome.
As Biggar makes clear, though, that does not mean scrapping every aspect of the Lions’ gameplan and starting completely afresh. It means taking greater advantage of the opportunities that do arise and not allowing South Africa to dictate the game’s pace as they did last week. “It’s about making sure we’re a bit more positive and take a few more chances but without going out there, playing sevens rugby and inviting a load of pressure on.”

Ministers are advising all UK nationals in Afghanistan to leave the country because of the “worsening security situation” but have warned people “not to rely” on the Foreign Office for evacuations.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s website was updated on Friday, advising against all travel to Afghanistan. The change in advice comes in the face of growing turmoil in Afghanistan, as Taliban forces sweep across the country.

The US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York said on Friday that Phyo Hein Htut, 28, and Ye Hein Zaw, 20, had each been charged with one count of conspiracy to assault and make a violent attack upon a foreign official, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Officials say the village of Monte Lake likely suffered extensive damage, but conditions remain too dangerous for a full assessment. The village, a popular summer holiday destination, has a seasonal population of nearly 3,000.

                    <span>This German-Austrian animation aimed at younger children borrows from vaguely familiar sources
Based on a well-known German book for children from 1915, this derivative but adequate animated feature fuses together an assortment of vaguely familiar characters and story tropes. The clever bit is that the film takes ideas from folklore and appears to be inspired by pre-existing intellectual property without infringing it.
For instance, one of the characters that early-adolescent protagonist Pete (voiced by Aleks Le) meets on his way to the moon, where his sister has been taken prisoner, is the Sandman, a traditional figure in northern European mythology and popularised by ETA Hoffmann in the early 19th century. Later on, our heroes get to ride the backs of giant polar bears, remarkably similar to the ones in Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials book series. Meanwhile, the humans’ guides also include beetles wistfully looking for abducted loved ones that seem to be mutant descendants of Disney’s Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio and the creepy crawlies from A Bug’s Life.

Romero arrived in England on Thursday to complete his medical and will not have to isolate because he is vaccinated, provided he returns a negative test on Saturday.

                    <span>First Test: England 183 &amp; 25-0; India 278
Ollie Robinson picks up five wickets but India forge lead

As the two sides left Trent Bridge at the end of a lively third day bookended by rain, India were the happier. The tourists had scrapped hard with the bat, chiselling out a 95-run first-innings lead, and, though England closed on 25 for no loss, it is the hosts who are under the greater amount of pressure heading into the fourth morning.
England’s batsmen will at least draw heart from Dom Sibley and Rory Burns surviving 11.1 overs before the heavens once again opened over Nottingham. And while their 183 all out on day one gave India an early foothold in the series, this 40-minute passage of play suggested it need not necessarily result in a 1-0 deficit. It may well be that this was a significant day for Joe Root’s team in the long run, too. Ollie Robinson secured a maiden five-wicket haul that not only underlined why his attributes are so highly rated but also proved that the events which marred his debut at Lord’s back in June – the emergence of offensive social media posts by his younger self – have not wrecked a promising international career in its infancy.

The victims’ family members, joined by first responders and survivors of the 2001 attack, released a letter on Friday as the event’s 20th anniversary nears calling on the US president to skip this year’s memorial events unless he releases the documents.

Boris Johnson is facing mounting anger after it emerged he continued with a tour of Scotland and decided not to isolate despite a member of his team testing positive for Covid-19 on the trip.
A senior government source told the Guardian the prime minister and official were “side-by-side” on several occasions and even travelled together on an RAF Voyager between Glasgow and Aberdeen, but a Downing Street spokesperson said they did not come into close contact.

The starkest warning yet on how close the global climate is to the point of no return will be delivered to the world on Monday morning, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – made up of the world’s top climate scientists – publishes a landmark report.
Details are still under wraps, but the Guardian has confirmed that the warning from the IPCC will reinforce how vital it is to try to prevent temperatures from reaching more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists will warn, the consequences of extreme weather will be devastating. The world must act urgently: if greenhouse gas emissions are not halved in this decade, 1.5C of heating will be inevitable and probably irreversible.

Retailers have been accused of doing too little to warn customers about recalled cat food that has been linked to the deaths of potentially thousands of pets, prompting concern that some remains on sale in shops.
As more details emerged of the scandal, cat owners spoke of their distress at watching their pets suffer and die.

The mixed relays may have finished last weekend, but what a lot of conflicting emotions for the eight British sprinters who won medals in the 4x100m on Friday night.
The men won the silver behind Italy, the women the bronze behind Jamaica and the United States, and between them the British athletes ran the gamut from joy to frustration, anger and regret. Dina Asher-Smith was among the disappointed, she had hoped to win more than one bronze at these Games. It was not her injured hamstring that was nagging at her, but the sense that the relay team should have done better.

                    <span>Raising the cap on gas and electricity charges will have a societal impact across Britain – and a political one too
The energy regulator Ofgem sounded apologetic as it announced another big rise in the industry’s price cap on Friday. It was right to do so. It is hard to think of anyone – except the energy companies and the fossil-fuel-producing states – for whom the latest rise is anything other than seriously bad news. These price hikes will have a societal impact across Britain, with serious implications for the economy, the greening agenda and politics too. And they will come as winter begins and as jobs, incomes and household budgets all face fresh uncertainties as pandemic economic protections are eased. Make no mistake. This is a big event. It should not be permitted to pass quietly.
Under the system created by Theresa May to limit rip-off energy bills, the cap rises and falls in six-month cycles as the price of gas changes. Gas prices have risen by around 50% in the most recent period to reach a 16-year high, partly because of resurgent global demand as the pandemic eases and partly because some gas producers are restricting supply to drive prices up. October’s rise comes on top of an average £96-a-year rise which came into force in April. But October’s is significantly bigger – a second whammy of up to £139 (which few companies will try to avoid charging) for the 11m households on default tariffs paying by direct debit, and of up to £153 for the 4m others using prepayment meters.

                    <span>The human cost is accumulating with the withdrawal of US and British troops 
The fears held by many Afghans since Joe Biden announced the withdrawal of all US troops by September have been not only realised but surpassed. Many anticipated steady gains by the Taliban, but the speed and scale of their escalating advance has stunned observers. On Friday they captured the city of Zaranj in Nimruz, the first provincial capital they have taken. The prospect of full Taliban rule – almost two decades after they were toppled by the US-led invasion – or a devastating all-out civil war on the scale of the 1990s looms ever larger.
Record numbers of civilians have been killed and injured since 1 May, a United Nations report warned last week, and the toll could intensify as fighting spills from rural areas into towns and cities, which some hope can be better defended. Some had argued that a newer, less extreme Taliban might have evolved – placing faith in the statements of their representatives in Doha. But Human Rights Watch says that their forces are summarily executing detained soldiers, police and civilians suspected of ties to the Afghan government. In areas under Taliban control, girls are banned from school once more.

Hoggan, who worked down a pit here in Wakefield and one at Selby, now devotes a large portion of his time to fight for millions of pounds of pensions savings to be returned to miners and their families, many of whom are struggling financially.

“I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared,” said Muir, recalling the moment she gunned past Sifan Hassan on the final bend to move into the silver medal position. “Because the past few times I have lost it in the last 200 metres. I was so scared that I was going to get pipped to fourth.”

Vectura bosses recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the improved Carlyle offer, and withdrew its previous advice that they approve the PMI offer.

Thousands of people have fled wildfires that are burning out of control in Greece and Turkey, including a large blaze just north of Athens that left one person dead, as a protracted heatwave turned forests into tinderboxes and flames threatened populated areas, electricity installations and historical sites.
Turkey’s wildfires, described as the worst in decades, have swept through swathes of the southern coast for the past 10 days, killing eight people.

Courtney Lawes says Lions need to stay out of dog fight

The British &amp; Irish Lions have been told they are welcome to “play touch rugby” in the third Test against South Africa on Saturday, with the Springboks hitting back at claims they have adopted time-wasting tactics to take the series to a decider.
The Lions again stand on the verge of history with a second shot at a first series win in South Africa for 24 years, having failed to take an unassailable 2-0 lead last week.

You report that several governments have been offering cash incentives, lotteries or gifts to citizens who opt to get vaccinated (Savings bonds, lotteries and cheap food: do vaccine incentives work?, 3 August). However, there is evidence that offering incentives may discourage vaccination – particularly among those most concerned about adverse effects.
Behavioural research confirms that paying people to perform altruistic actions often backfires. For example, because paying blood donors breaks social norms about voluntary contribution, it can substantially reduce the numbers willing to donate. People collecting charitable donations invest more effort and raise more money when not paid than when paid a small commission.

                    <span>Behaviours such as ‘fake crying’ and hiding disliked food do not necessarily indicate an intention to deceive, says Anthony Marcel
Kathryn Hughes begins her review (28 July) of The Truth About Lies by Aja Raden thus: “At about the age of 18 months babies start to get sneaky. They hide food they don’t like and go in for bouts of fake crying.” In what follows, she does not question the author’s apparent suggestion that these behaviours amount to lies or their basis.
But if lying is defined as intention to deceive, these behaviours, if not better described, are very poor evidence for it. Regarding putting disliked food where it cannot be seen: seen by whom? It might simply be for the children themselves to avoid seeing something disliked: out of sight, out of mind (like out of the pram).

Christine Sinclair wins first major tournament at 38

The all-time international record goalscorer Christine Sinclair praised Bev Priestman for “changing the attitude of the team” and said they were “claiming” the English manager for their own after she led Canada to Olympic gold and Sinclair to her first major tournament victory at 38.
University of Texas’s Julia Grosso scored the decisive penalty as Canada beat back-to-back silver medallists Sweden in a sudden-death shootout after a Jessie Fleming penalty cancelled out Stina Blackstenius’s first-half strike to force the game beyond 90 minutes. The veteran goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl and her counterpart Stephanie Labbé were the heroes with each team scoring only two of their first five penalties before the latter stopped the Chelsea defender Jonna Andersson’s tame effort and Grosso scored to give Canada the victory.

                    <span>Demands for change are the raw material of politics. Keir Starmer needs to start addressing them
Labour leaders love to talk about values. Gordon Brown and Jeremy Corbyn both paid homage to what the latter called “shared majority British values”. Last month, Keir Starmer held up the party’s narrow win in Batley and Spen as proof that “when we are true to our values … Labour can win”. More recently his new chief strategist, the pollster Deborah Mattinson, was reported as arguing that Labour’s primary challenge is to develop “clearer, sharper, more uplifting messaging about the party’s values”.
So far the Labour leader has adhered with particular intensity to an orthodoxy according to which “values” are the wellspring of political engagement – and therefore Labour can do nothing until it convinces the electorate it shares their values. This is a terrible mistake. Politics is not grounded in values but in demands.

As a child, I stole a pair of my mother’s high-waisted, pink and white nylon knickers and wore them under my short trousers to school. I was six years old and not getting what I needed from her. I felt I couldn’t access her. She was physically and emotionally unavailable, and in a marriage that was “on the rocks”, as she used to say. I had also tried to tell my parents I was being physically, sexually and emotionally abused at school, but they scolded me for telling lies and not concentrating on my work.
I’m now in my 60s. I’ve been in therapy for many years, and have come to understand my parents’ difficulties and, more importantly, myself. Recently, I have felt the old, suppressed urge to buy women’s underwear online. But I’m conflicted, confused and haunted by other people’s messages. This might be because I grew up in a country dominated by religion.

Allow me to let you in on a little secret. Many people working in politics and the media openly discuss the fact that Boris Johnson’s gaffes are entirely calculated. I once met someone who used to work for him and they told me that before he appears in the media, Johnson ruffles his hair to ensure he appears more dishevelled than he actually is.
This ruse has been useful to our prime minister throughout his political career. It has helped him to climb the greasy pole without facing any consequences for accusations of serial lying, allegations of bigotry or his involvement in the planned assault of a journalist. And it is what we must bear in mind when we consider his latest comments on the closure of British coal mines.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announced this week that everyone in the UK aged 16 and 17 should be offered the Covid-19 vaccine. Just two weeks ago, it said the vaccine wouldn’t be offered to non-vulnerable people aged 12-17. The change in position is welcome, but the reasons for the committee’s two-week delay, and its decision to not extend the vaccine to 12- 15-year-olds, are unclear. Unlike the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the committee has offered no quantitative analysis of the risks associated with vaccinating people in this younger age group.
Delaying the rollout of the vaccine to adolescents is risky. Recent figures show that 1% of 10-19s were being diagnosed with Covid-19 a week. Waiting for further data on vaccine safety when infections are ripping through younger age groups isn’t cautious, it’s reckless.

Coronavirus – latest updates

There are no beaches, no seagulls, and in some places there are more cows than people. This is summer 2021: the year that Britons sought social distancing as much as sun, sea and sand.
Demand for rural retreats in counties such as Worcestershire and Staffordshire has soared this summer as people swapped the Algarve and Costa del Sol for the countryside, data from travel websites shows.

Snickers in Spain has pulled a controversial advertisement and apologised for any “misunderstanding that may have been caused” after the 20-second film was widely condemned for being homophobic.
The advert shows the Spanish influencer Aless Gibaja ordering a “sexy orange juice” while a friend trades puzzled looks with the waiter. The waiter responds by handing Gibaja a Snickers ice-cream bar, and after a bite, Gibaja appears to transform into a bearded man with a deep voice.

Six EU states have now fully inoculated a larger share of their total populations with  a coronavirus vaccine than the UK, after the bloc’s dire initial rollout took off while Britain’s impressive early jab rate has slumped.
According to government and health service figures collated by the online science publication Our World In Data, Malta, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Ireland have all overtaken the UK in terms of the percentages of their populations who are fully vaccinated.

We have so much to worry about, it’s a relief that at least one big source of angst is no longer there to keep us up at night. Given how much psychic energy so many – inside the US and out – once devoted to him, how he came to invade even our dreams, there is solace in the fact that these days we need pay no more attention to Donald Trump. Right? I’m afraid not.
True, the great orange spectre has disappeared from the social media timelines, exiled by the emperors of Facebook and Twitter, reduced to starting his own blog to get around the ban – an effort that, like so many Trump enterprises before it, was quietly abandoned in failure. It lasted a month.

                    <span>My wife was in the new house waiting for a delivery. I was in the old one working. What could possibly go wrong?
My wife and I rarely have a proper argument, so it came as quite a shock to both of us when one did come along. I would describe it as less of an argument and more of a calm conversation during which she pretended to be less annoyed than she really was and I tried to do that annoying thing men do: to be logical about how annoyed she was feeling (which is a really effective way of turning somebody’s anger into pure rage).
It was actually entirely my fault, the insertion of “actually” being entirely unnecessary, to be honest, as it usually is my fault. I’m not saying that in a woe-is-me-aren’t-I-a-put-upon-husband way. It really is almost always my fault (the insertion of “almost” there… you get the idea).

Required or not, I love wearing my face mask. I love it for the security it gives vulnerable people; for the anonymity it provides; for the floral smell of my moisturiser, which it keeps in my nostrils even when the sun beats down on the city’s bins. And, as I realised this week, face masks are a great opportunity for some adult orthodontics.
I’m getting braces. I’d been thinking about it for years. But it wasn’t just the money or pain that stalled me: deep down, I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to straighten the crooked smile that felt so uniquely me. And ironing it out for no discernible health reason felt at best vain, at worst conceding defeat to beauty norms imposed by “The Man”.

The foreign secretary has agreed to consider allowing Afghan journalists who worked for the British to flee to the UK if their lives are endangered by the resurgence of the Taliban, after an outcry from a coalition of British newspapers and broadcasters.
Dominic Raab signalled the policy U-turn on Friday, saying he recognised the bravery of the Afghan journalists. A scheme that was set up to offer a safe haven to Afghans who worked with the British will be expanded to include those who worked as journalists.

Tim Richards, the chief executive of Vue, the UK’s third biggest chain, says last weekend proved to be its best since February 2020 thanks to a slate of new films being given a theatrical release rather than just on streaming services.

The first time the Savoy hotel’s American Bar had a woman at the helm was in 1903, when Ada “Coley” Coleman – whose creations included the classic cocktail the Hanky Panky – took the role. But since her more than two decades reign, the internationally renowned London institution has never appointed a female head bartender since.
Now, nearly a century later, Britain’s oldest surviving cocktail bar is finally to have a woman in charge once again when it reopens in the autumn for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Shannon Tebay, who starts the role on Monday, will not only become the first woman in 95 years to hold the revered position but also the first American.

Gong Lijiao, 32, won a gold medal in the women’s shot put on Sunday with a personal best of 20.58 metres. It was the first gold medal in a field event for any Chinese athlete ever, and the first gold for an Asian athlete in shot put.

A Russian lesbian family who received death threats after they appeared in an advertisement for the food chain VkusVill say they feel safe in Barcelona and accepted for who they are.
The family were targeted in a hate campaign on social media after they appeared in the ad. The company later apologised and replaced the photo with one of a heterosexual family.

                    <span>Indigenous women in North and Central America are coming together to share ancestral knowledge of amaranth, a plant booming in popularity as a health food
Just over 10 years ago, a small group of Indigenous Guatemalan farmers visited Beata Tsosie-Peña’s stucco home in northern New Mexico. In the arid heat, the visitors, mostly Maya Achì women from the forested Guatemalan town of Rabinal, showed Tsosie-Peña how to plant the offering they had brought with them: amaranth seeds.
Back then, Tsosie-Peña had just recently come interested in environmental justice amid frustration at the ecological challenges facing her native Santa Clara Pueblo – an Indigenous North American community just outside the New Mexico town of Española, which is downwind from the nuclear facilities that built the atomic bomb. Tsosie-Peña had begun studying permaculture and other Indigenous agricultural techniques. Today, she coordinates the environmental health and justice program at Tewa Women United, where she maintains a hillside public garden that’s home to the descendants of those first amaranth seeds she was given more than a decade ago.

Kate French of Great Britain produced a stirring laser‑run performance on a steamy night at the Tokyo Stadium to reel in the field and take gold in the modern pentathlon.
French came to these Games having won the World Cup event this year but still vaguely haunted by her fifth spot in Rio five years ago. At 30 she has her moment of sporting ultimacy in one of the most taxing, mixed and undeniably strange disciplines at the Games.

See all our coronavirus coverage

The Japanese government  has named three people this week who broke quarantine rules after returning from overseas in an attempt to shame others into complying with anti-virus measures. 
The authorities are hoping to tap into traits, such as the sense of collective and the importance of not breaking social norms, that Japan is known for.
However, fatigue from prolonged states of emergency and ire at quarantine exceptions made for Olympic athletes may mean the “name and shame” policy has limited effect, or will even backfire.
The names – but no other details – of the three rule-breakers who are reported to have avoided contact with authorities during their 14-day mandatory quarantine were announced on Monday. Some social media users attempted to identify the trio but there was little public outcry.

                    <span>When the 2011 riots broke out, they were widely dismissed as plain criminality. A new work by film-maker Baff Akoto tells a different story – and shows how the civil unrest implicates us all
The video opens on a scene of hazy, unspecified danger. A group of people are milling about on a street corner that could be anywhere, their identities obscured by hoods, caps and the graininess of the footage. It is almost midnight, and the road appears deserted. Suddenly the anonymous figures surge towards the railings on the edge of the pavement and hurl objects at a passing police vehicle, which races away off screen. Initially, there is no sound: just the remote gaze of the CCTV camera. Then as if from the other side of the glass, voices cut through.
“Middle England people – the older generation at the time – they didn’t care,” says one. “They took it as: ‘Oh yeah, all these people from all these areas are scumbags.’” The words are occasionally drowned out by the noise of helicopters whirring above or police horses clumping below, yet the speakers persist. “When you have an elastic band, when you stretch it out to its extreme, it snaps back,” explains another. “The more you try to break a person, the more they build up resistance.”

Mr Corman (Apple TV+) is one of those comedies that is not really a comedy, unless you find unceasing malaise to be of the utmost hilarity. It is the definition of a slow-burn; the first two episodes are available now, with the rest following weekly, but this early outing offers only hints of what is to come. Based on the opening episodes, Mr Corman barely stands out from the other not-so-funny comedies with an indie film sensibility. But stick with it, and it unfurls into something far more curious and absorbing.

Concerns have been raised about the persistently low vaccination rates in parts of London, with a third of adults unvaccinated in some neighbourhoods compared with other parts of England where rates are at almost 100%.
Seven out of 10 local authorities with the lowest first-dose rates were London boroughs, according to Guardian analysis of the latest NHS England figures to 1 August.

Abel Tesfaye settles into his imperial phase with a masterful Moroder-esque track that demonstrates how strong his vocal ability has become
It’s well-documented how a spell of quality play by a footballer seems to create its own exponential power, snowballing their confidence and sending them into a flow state of accurate passing and silky runs. And so it is with pop music, where a star will lock into what’s been described as their “imperial phase”, where every song they touch sparkles with the ineffable magic of pop: something that goes beyond good tunes to a much more complex compound of charisma and musicianship.
Even more palpably than Dua Lipa or Ed Sheeran, the Weeknd is the global pop star that is most obviously in this phase at the moment. Emerging a decade ago with bruised, introspective R&amp;B that only the most jaded child in the playground would have stuck on their iPod, he’s now making music that seven-year-olds might enthusiastically bum-wiggle and fingerpoint to – as well as their teenage siblings and parents.

                    <span>Instead of examining the causes of unrest, the media and politicians consistently blame the madness of crowds
When riots happen, they are typically explained as an expression of the madness or badness of crowds. Rioters are condemned for the violence and destruction that occurs, which has nothing at all to do with the actions of authority, or with society at large. Years later, what was blindingly obvious is belatedly acknowledged: the previous riots were actually connected with social issues. Rioters had genuine grievances. Government policies played an important part. Yet when the next riot happens, the pattern repeats itself. The media and politicians suggest that this time it’s really different, and the mad, bad crowd is entirely to blame.
When the 1981 and 1985 riots took place in Brixton, both were dismissed as an expression of the atavism of crowds. They were simply “mobs on the rampage”, according to one Daily Telegraph headline, and had nothing at all to do with racism, inequality or policing. As the home secretary, Douglas Hurd, put it, the riots weren’t a cry for help, but a “cry for loot”.

                    <span>The married comedians on the great views, friendly folk – and friendlier sheep – encountered on their tour of England and Wales for a new TV series
With more British people holidaying at home and accommodation at a premium, demand for motorhoming holidays has soared. Curious to find out what “vanlife” is like, earlier this summer comedians Suki Webster and Paul Merton, who have been married since 2009, took to the road for a new Channel 5 TV series, Motorhoming with Merton and Webster. Over six episodes, it follows their trips through England and Wales in a 7.3-metre RollerTeam Pegaso 740 motorhome, and also offers vanlife hacks, kit testing and a peek inside some of Britain’s best vans. 
Suki Webster: Motorhoming isn’t  a “lie on the beach and just put your feet up” holiday, but you get used to it quite quickly. If you’re renting, there are quite a few things to work out in the first couple of days – the first being how to drive and not hit hedges or other cars. Within a few hours you get used to that. And then you’ve got to work out how to use the kitchen, how to make the shower work, how to change the gas and all of that. Once you adapt to it, it’s like a self-catering holiday but with the advantage that you wake up with a different view.
Paul Merton: Just to clarify, when Suki says “wake up to a different view”, she doesn’t mean that you haven’t put the handbrake on overnight and you wake up in the morning somewhere else. Sometimes when you arrive at a campsite and it’s getting dark you don’t take much in. The next morning when you get up it’s always a very pleasant surprise – particularly if you can see distant mountains or lakes or whatever. So it is constantly renewing your holiday experience.

Where to begin when celebrating the achievements of an athlete such as Laura Kenny? With her Olympic gold medal in the women’s madison, seized with unshakeable confidence alongside her riding partner Katie Archibald, at the Izu Velodrome on Friday?
Or with her status, thanks to that victory, as Britain’s most decorated female Olympian, level with the equestrian Charlotte Dujardin with a haul of six medals? Perhaps it would be more appropriate to mention first that she is the only British woman to win a gold medal at three successive Games. And then there is the small matter of her status as the most successful female cyclist in Olympic history, surpassing the Dutchwoman Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel.

National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists announced their findings this week: about 4m acres of habitat in the Gulf are unusable for fish and bottom-dwelling species. The researchers had estimated a smaller dead zone this year, predicting an average-sized area.

I’m English, she’s Canadian, and we met in the French Alps in 2016, quickly grew close, travelled around Europe, then got it into our heads that we should move to Glasgow. Wanting a project, we looked at auction listings and found an apartment in Pollokshields, Southside. It needed some love, but the starting price was £10k. Before deciding to bid, I’d spent a few nights sleeping in my van across the street from it. I liked it.
With Claire away, I ventured to the sale alone. It was my first time at a property auction. I took my seat and waited patiently. The problem was auctioneers speak fast, and this one had a strong Glaswegian accent: I was really struggling to follow. Thankfully, a brochure on my seat contained the details for every lot, while a screen behind the stage displayed its corresponding number. I ticked off each sale in my copy as we went, counting down.

First came the plague, then the flood, and now the fire. This has been a biblical summer, one where the doomsday warnings of climate scientists have felt increasingly close to the bone.
Horror stories of Chinese commuters drowning as underground train tunnels suddenly filled with water have merged uncomfortably in our imaginations with images of flash floods in east London, wildfires burning up the Turkish coast and a Canadian heatwave so fierce it cooked mussels in their shells on the beach.

Last month was the world’s worst July for wildfires since at least 2003 when satellite records began, scientists have said, as swaths of North America, Siberia, Africa and southern Europe continue to burn.
Driven by extreme heat and prolonged drought, the ignition of forests and grasslands released 343 megatonnes of carbon, about a fifth higher than the previous global peak for July, which was set in 2014.

Young people should not be “threatened or induced” into getting Covid-19 vaccines, according to the first minister of Wales, who contrasted his government’s approach to that of Downing Street on the eve of moves to scrap most remaining Welsh restrictions.
Mark Drakeford was speaking as the Welsh government prepared to abandon the rule that tells people to self-isolate if they are pinged by the NHS app, for those who are fully vaccinated, more than a week before England.

                    <span>The only deaf actor to win an Academy Award discusses going to rehab, speaking out about William Hurt and starring in deaf drama Coda
When early financial backers of Marlee Matlin’s new film, Coda, expressed their preference for hiring big-name actors to play the roles of two major deaf characters – her onscreen husband and son – she threatened to quit. She told them that deaf actors should play characters written as deaf. “I said: time out. This is not right. It’s not authentic and it’s not going to work. If you go down that route, I’m out, because I don’t want to be part of that effort of faking deaf. I’m glad they listened.”
I can’t imagine anyone not listening to Matlin. Speaking from her home in Los Angeles, she is funny and warm, but there is something intense about her, almost intimidating. She sits straight-backed, her focus sharp. She is not a woman to mince her words – which are translated from American Sign Language (ASL) by her longtime interpreter and producing partner, Jack Jason, who is also on the call from his front room. The pair have been working together since 1985, just before she won the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first film role, playing a young deaf woman in the 1986 drama Children of a Lesser God – beating Sigourney Weaver (who was up for Aliens), Jane Fonda, Kathleen Turner and Sissy Spacek.

Cutting carbon dioxide is not enough to solve the climate crisis – the world must act swiftly on another powerful greenhouse gas, methane, to halt the rise in global temperatures, experts have warned.
Leading climate scientists will give their starkest warning yet – that we are rushing to the brink of climate catastrophe – in a landmark report on Monday. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish its sixth assessment report, a comprehensive review of the world’s knowledge of the climate crisis and how human actions are altering the planet. It will show in detail how close the world is to irreversible change.

Sky Brown helps ramp up UK girls’ interest in skateboarding

Hannah, from Edinburgh, has been photographing women’s skateboarding around the world for more than 10 years, inspired by the diverse faces and underground culture of the scene. It has been her mission to question society’s perception of gender in sport and challenge how women are represented in the media through her images of skating and portraits of skaters.
Hannah won the inaugural Getty Images #ShowUs photography grant in March 2020 with the project, which aimed to look beyond stereotypes to shine the light on the faces of women, non-binary and femme-identifying skaters and support them to tell their stories.

                    <span>This week marks a decade since the riots that swept across England in August 2011. But has enough changed to prevent similar unrest happening again?
The killing of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old mixed-race man, by police officers in London in 2011 sparked rioting that spread first around the capital and then to cities and towns across England. Over five nights in August, the country witnessed its worst civil unrest for a generation. Five people died, many more were injured and more than £300m of property damage was done across England.
Youth worker and Tottenham resident Andrew Boateng looks back to that period 10 years ago and tells Nosheen Iqbal about how it felt to watch his community go up in flames. He talks about the aftermath of the riots and the cuts to youth services that he believes could once again create conditions for unrest.

Climate scientists have detected warning signs of the collapse of the Gulf Stream, one of the planet’s main potential tipping points.
The research found “an almost complete loss of stability over the last century” of the currents that researchers call the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The currents are already at their slowest point in at least 1,600 years, but the new analysis shows they may be nearing a shutdown.

                    <span>The Belarusian Olympic sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya flew out of Tokyo on Wednesday to begin a life in exile after refusing to return home. Andrew Roth describes a growing threat to internal critics of the regime
When the Belarus sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya criticised her coaches for entering her ‘behind [her] back’ in the 4x400m relay event at the Tokyo Olympics, she set off a chain of events that quickly went beyond her control. On Sunday, she was removed from the team and driven to the airport by officials. But Tsimanouskaya refused to board the flight back to Minsk and sought Japanese police protection.
The Guardian’s Andrew Roth tells Rachel Humphreys that this sporting disagreement quickly became political and Tsimanouskaya had little option but to seek refuge outside of Belarus. Now she has flown from Tokyo to Vienna after being granted humanitarian assistance by Poland. Her husband, Arseniy Zdanevich, fled Belarus for Ukraine on Sunday.

                    <span>In CSS, everything is a box. And each box – whether it&#x27;s text, an image, a div, a span, or any other element – has a border that separates its edges from other boxes around it.

A leading insect expert has called for a UK-wide ban on the use of pesticides in gardens and urban areas to protect bees, wildlife and human health.
Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, said outlawing chemical spraying in the country’s 22m private gardens, along with road verges, parks and other green spaces, could slow insect decline by creating a network of nature-friendly habitats where insects can recover.

Harwood, an architectural historian with Historic England, is enthusing about Newbury Park bus station in Ilford, one of nine sites being recognised by Historic England to mark the 70th anniversary of the Festival of Britain.

Footballer Marcus Rashford is calling on health workers to spread the word about free food vouchers for children from low-income households after it emerged that 40% of those who are eligible have yet to sign up.
The government’s Healthy Start scheme enables parents in receipt of a welfare benefit, who have at least one child under four or who have been pregnant for 10 weeks or more, to obtain free food vouchers worth £4.25 weekly which can be exchanged for milk, infant formula, fruit, vegetables and pulses.

A series of genetic signals that influences the age women begin menopause has been identified, potentially paving the way to fertility treatment that could extend the natural reproductive lifespan of women.
Researchers scanned the genes of more than 200,000 women and found nearly 300 genetic signals that researchers said could help identify why some women are predisposed to early menopause, the health consequences of going through menopause early and whether these signals can be manipulated to improve fertility.

Racist abuse of footballers on Twitter increased over the course of the 2020-21 season and the majority of offending accounts are still active on the platform, research by the Professional Footballers’ Association has found. 
More than six million tweets were analysed in a year-long study that identified 359 accounts as sending explicitly racist abuse to players, with the volume of abuse rising by 48% in the second half of the season.

The prime minister and chancellor will issue a joint call to action on Thursday aimed at “igniting an investment big bang” that would “unlock the hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in UK institutions”.

Emphasising that “we absolutely have to protect people’s jobs”, the Labour leader said: “We’ve got to try to create a timetable for [the cessation of exploration]. It’s got to be subject to consensus and agreement, and we have got to bring communities with us.

Current tour agreement states series would be shared

Warren Gatland would be in favour of Saturday’s third Test decider between the British &amp; Irish Lions and South Africa going to extra time in the event of a draw, thereby avoiding a second successive series ending in a stalemate.
It is understood the tour agreement states that the series will be tied if the third Test is a draw and Gatland is aware of that stipulation. A tie therefore remains the expected outcome but as has already been demonstrated, changes can be made at short notice, with a second match against the Sharks arranged and Cape Town selected as the venue for all three Tests at the 11th hour. Earlier in the tour Rassie Erasmus was also keen for the Lions to play against South Africa A twice – a proposal given short shrift by Gatland.

The Mexican government is suing six gunmakers in a Massachusetts court, alleging negligence in their failure to control their distributors and that the illegal market in Mexico “has been their economic lifeblood”.

In a notice filed in the federal register, the department said it could find no trace of the bottle’s whereabouts and that there is an “ongoing inquiry” into what happened to the booze.

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou say American prosecutors acted in “bad faith” and abused the Canadian justice system when they pursued the Huawei chief financial officer, in final arguments of the telecoms executive’s closely watched extradition proceedings.
In a Vancouver courtroom on Wednesday, Meng’s legal team argued that American prosecutors misled the Canadian justice system in their legal summary of the allegations against Meng. Her team says this abuse of process obliges the judge overseeing the case to toss out the extradition request against Meng and set her free.

Pursuit of Sevilla’s Koundé stalls after Zouma rejects West Ham

Romelu Lukaku is closing on a move to Chelsea after informing Internazionale of his desire to return to the European champions.
Chelsea are preparing a new bid for Lukaku after having an offer rejected this week and the deal is beginning to look inevitable despite Inter’s reluctance to sell the striker.

The Duchess of Sussex has used her 40th birthday to launch an initiative to help women back into work after the huge job losses caused by the Covid pandemic.
The project, which was launched with a comedy film featuring a juggling Prince Harry, is called 40x40 and is focused on encouraging people around the world to donate 40 minutes of their time to help women return to the workplace.

Nicaraguan authorities have detained a candidate in the November presidential elections, her party has said, as the government of President Daniel Ortega shows no sign of ending a sweeping crackdown against the opposition.
For months Ortega’s government has been detaining political adversaries, including presidential hopefuls, ahead of an election in which the former Marxist guerrilla and cold war antagonist of Washington will be running for a fourth consecutive term.

A coalition of British newspapers and broadcasters has appealed to the government to expand its refugee visa programme for Afghans, to include people who have worked for UK media over the past 20 years.
In an open letter to the prime minister and foreign secretary, more than 20 outlets outlined the vital need for a route to safety for reporters whose work with British media could put them at risk of Taliban reprisals.

It was quiet, too quiet. It was the taut, knotted silence a cricket fan knows all too well, the one they can read instantly, whether they’re just arriving at the ground a little late for the start of play, or popping their head through from the next room to check the score on the telly. A quietness that speaks volumes, that needs no translation, that transmits its message directly to one’s bones. England had lost a wicket in the first over, and the hush wasn’t so much breathless as suffocated.

                    <span>Slovenia’s Janja Garnbret dominates qualifying as Team GB’s Shauna Coxsey fails to make final but realises Olympic dream
As Shauna Coxsey and Iuliia Kaplina threw their bodies up a 15-metre vertical wall as fast as they possibly could, the difference between them was immediately clear. Kaplina is the world record holder at speed climbing. Coxsey is, well, not a speed climber at all. Kaplina immediately separated herself from her British rival, but then as she neared the top, she slipped. By the time she returned to the ground, she was weeping.
While the announcer at Aomi Urban Sports Park tried to comfort Kaplina by pointing out to the crowd of country delegations and volunteers that she was still in fifth place after her first attempt, she knew the truth. Such is her speciality in speed, in this strange combination of three distinct climbing sports under one roof, Kaplina almost needed to be perfect due to her vulnerability on the other two events.

Consuming alcohol increases the risk of getting more cancers than previously thought, according to a major study, which also found that drinking coffee protects against liver cancer. 
Alcohol consumption is linked to several cancers including those of the head and neck – mouth, pharynx and larynx – oesophageal and bowel, along with the more widely known connection with breast and liver cancer, according to an international team led by Imperial College London.

From where Rishi Sunak sits, he might regard Taylor Wimpey’s bumper set of first-half figures as a triumph of policymaking. The chancellor threw subsidies at the housing market during the pandemic in the form of stamp duty holidays and probably hoped to see what has now materialised: record house completions and the UK’s third largest builder talking about profit upgrades and “excellent momentum into the medium term”.
From a policy perspective, though, the proper way to look at events is the precise opposite: the stamp duty giveaway was a waste of public money.

It was another satisfying day on the water, with Eilidh McIntyre and reigning champion Hannah Mills clinching the final sailing gold of the Games in the women’s 470. Mills became the most successful female Olympic sailor with the Tokyo gold, having won a silver medal at London 2012 and gold in Rio 2016 before her then partner, Saskia Clarke, retired.

When Boris Johnson visits Scotland, there is no rule that says he must meet Nicola Sturgeon, although courtesy would probably have brought them together if the relationship were less dysfunctional. On the eve of the trip, the first minister invited the prime minister to Bute House, knowing his itinerary was fixed. She could be confident he would refuse, which he did, sending a letter of his own, urging cooperation between their administrations on Covid vaccines.
The exchange was political theatre. Ms Sturgeon wants to give the impression that Mr Johnson represents the government of a different state, and make his refusal to meet her look like a snub to all of Scotland. Mr Johnson does not want to be bounced into a summit that nationalists would treat as part of the negotiation over a second independence referendum.

                    <span>A remarkable speech from a senior rate-setter at the Bank of England lays bare the terrible predicament the UK is in
One of the big battles likely to be fought at Westminster this autumn will be over interest rates. This may seem an odd subject for a political row. Didn’t Gordon Brown remove interest rates from government control more than two decades ago? Isn’t Threadneedle Street the other side of London from the House of Commons? Yes and yes – and yet that hasn’t stopped monetary policy featuring in every economic debate since the 1990s, from the loss of industry to the austerity years. This time around, the worry is over inflation and whether the Bank of England is too relaxed about rising prices.
Last month, a House of Lords committee castigated the bank for its “addiction” to creating money through its £895bn quantitative-easing programme which, it claimed, could push prices up further. MPs on the right of the Conservative party are also starting to worry about inflation and what happens if the bank has to raise interest rates.

They also claim the warehouse staff have access to more lucrative bonuses.

The long-running legal case centres on allegations that Rebekah Vardy leaked stories about fellow footballer’s wife Rooney to journalists at the Sun. The court heard details of the enormous costs that have been run up by both sides in the case, which are already on track to top more than £1m.

Rihanna, the singer of hits such as Umbrella and We Found Love, is officially a billionaire and the world’s richest female musician.
However, most of her fortune, estimated on Wednesday by Forbes magazine to be $1.7bn (£1.2bn), does not come from chart-topping singles, but from the success of her cosmetics empire.

Highways England has said it is proceeding with plans to dig a tunnel near Stonehenge, despite the £1.7bn scheme being declared unlawful by the high court.
The government-owned company said it would continue to appoint building contracts to ensure the procurement process ran to schedule – although it has paused plans for preparatory work while the Department for Transport “considers its options”.

Nuno Espírito Santo has admitted he is yet to speak to Harry Kane as it emerged that the striker, who is desperate to quit Tottenham and join Manchester City, had prolonged his unauthorised leave of absence, spending another day out of the UK.
Kane angered the Spurs hierarchy when he failed to report for his first day of pre-season work on Monday and it came to light that he was on a family holiday. The 28-year was in the Bahamas before moving on to Florida and he was still there on Wednesday.

Support crumbles as state impeachment cogs begin to turn


Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York who was found by the state’s top prosecutor to have violated the law by sexually harassing 11 women, continued to brave the storm on Wednesday while political support crumbled around him and moves for impeachment gathered pace.
The third-term Democratic governor – the longest-serving chief executive of any state in the nation – showed no sign of capitulating in the face of almost universal calls for his resignation from the Democratic establishment after the state’s top prosecutor released the results of the five-month investigation this week. Demands for him to stand aside poured in from individuals and institutions that had formed the bedrock of his empire.

As the highly transmissible Delta variant continues to spread across at least 17 provinces, China is facing a new dilemma: is its once-successful “zero tolerance” approach to containing the spread of the virus over, and what comes next?
Unlike Britain and Singapore, where officials have explicitly encouraged people to “learn to live with the virus”, China has yet to officially shift its messaging.

Germany’s health minister is planning to introduce sweeping measures next month that could considerably restrict the lives of people who do not get a coronavirus vaccine, according to widespread reports.
Jens Spahn has warned parliament and leaders of the 16 states that the tighter restrictions are necessary to avoid a new and dangerous wave of infections in the coming months, in a report seen by a large number of German media outlets.

After a series of raucous protests involving pots and pans, residents in a small Catalan town near Barcelona have won a victory in their attempt to do away with the nightly silence imposed on the town to appease tourists.
The clattering began late last month in Banyoles, population 19,600, after residents realised that the bells on the Santa Maria dels Turers church had stopped ringing at night. A protest was hastily called. “We ask that the bells return to sounding out the 24 hours as well as the quarter-hours,” read the call to action posted online.

                    <span>Until society confronts institutional and cultural racism, such inequalities will be immune to changes in the law
What’s in a name? A great deal it would seem, including perhaps a diminished chance of being shortlisted for a job, offered a university place, or a rental property if you have an ethnic or racial minority background. Even a nursery place can hang in the balance, as Scotland’s secretary for health and sport, Humza Yousaf, recently discovered: he suspects that an application for his two-year-old daughter was denied by a nursery in Dundee on discriminatory grounds. (The nursery in question has denied the allegation.)
To researchers and activists who continually identify the drivers of racial inequality, and who are long accustomed to the obfuscation that stymies change, this would not come as news. What’s striking is that, despite legislation designed to eliminate such inequalities, they persist. And they will continue to, until white-majority societies confront the institutional and cultural factors that make them possible.

In 2018, as Andrew Cuomo was in the thick of a re-election battle against the Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon, he vowed that he would complete a third term as governor of New York state unless “God strikes me dead”.
It may take less than the creator to put an end to the political career of the pugnacious Democrat. With the sexual harassment accusations of 11 women corroborated by an official inquiry from New York’s top prosecutor, and with potential impeachment proceedings looming, Cuomo is teetering on the edge of a spectacular fall from grace.

But in this post-lockdown summer, some practitioners (or professors, to give them their traditional titles) are expressing concern that the bad behaviour seems to be spilling out from the puppet booth into the audience.

                    <span>Georgian lifts equivalent of an upright piano but key question in Tokyo is whether the sport has a Games future
In the British newspaper business we tend to measure heights in quantities of double-decker buses, and area in multiples of tennis courts and football pitches. Unfortunately, when it comes to weight there doesn’t seem to be an agreed international standard. This makes it tricky to convey exactly what Georgia’s Lasha Talakhadze did in the super-heavy division of the men’s weightlifting at the Tokyo International Forum on Wednesday evening, when he broke his own world record by lifting 488kg. That’s about the weight of an average dromedary camel. Or four Vespa scooters. Or 67 shot puts. Or 2,425 turnips. Take your pick.
Of course Talakhadze, 27, 6ft 6in and 27 stone, didn’t do it all at once. That would be ridiculous. No. He set one world record in the snatch (223kg, or the gold-medal winning crew in the men’s lightweight double sculls, and their boat and oars), and another in the clean-and-jerk (265kg, or one large upright piano). Next he says he’s planning to become the first man in history to lift a combined total of 500kg.

Your long read had some interesting facts (The lost history of the electric car – and what it tells us about the future of transport, 3 August), but it is also worth drawing attention to the extensive commercial use of electric vehicles in the period leading up to the 1970s. At school, I put in the occasional Friday night shift at a large bakery, where dozens of distinctively shaped vans used by the roundsmen were lined up around the walls of the depot, being recharged ready for their morning duties. The same would have been true in most towns and cities.
At university, my trunk was piled up at the end of term in the porch for collection by a three-wheeled British Railways battery-driven tractor unit, with its accompanying trailer, for delivery to the station, and collection by a similar method at the other end. These vehicles were a familiar sight at a time when rail carried more small freight than nowadays. Milk floats were almost universally electric. In many places it was electric trolley buses, rather than buses, that originally replaced trams, until declining oil prices made diesel a cheaper fuel than electricity generated by coal.

Can the Guardian please investigate the rationale behind the Covid travel restrictions relating to “red list” countries? Some of the countries on the red list, such as Kenya, have very low Covid cases and deaths, but are among the world’s poorest and with little influence on government policy. 
Essentially, the UK government is using this list to appease the public who need to see the government doing something – but at the same time the government is assured that the backlash will be minimal because these countries have very little voice.

                    <span>Aziah ‘Zola’ Wells’s viral story of her crazily dangerous 2015 trip to Florida in search of  pole-dancing money is brought to the screen with seductive comedy
In 2015, a part-time dancer from Detroit called Aziah “Zola” Wells went viral with a cheeky Twitter thread purporting to tell the pulp-factual tale of her recent, crazily dangerous road trip to Florida with someone called Jessica, whom she’d only just met. This woman had persuaded Zola there was big money in pole-dancing for rich clients in Tampa, but Zola had to share the car with Jessica’s creepy boyfriend and even creepier pimp, and soon it was clear that Zola was going to have to do much more than dance. She was in way over her head.
Or was she? Followers of Zola’s posts loved them at least partly for how outrageously unreliable they were: Zola was clearly embellishing, or pre-emptively giving her side of the story before Jessica did the same. Now this has been turned into a very entertaining lowlife crime comedy from director and co-writer Janicza Bravo, a film that preserves the fishy flavour of the online original – if perhaps only semi-intentionally – and has interesting things to say about the exhaustingly performative and self-promotional world of social media.

                    <span>Miyoko Schinner has been on a years-long quest to make tasty vegan cheese. Now she wants to help dairy farmers switch to plant-based farming
Miyoko Schinner calls herself “the queen of vegan cheese”. The chef, activist and author wrote the 2012 book Artisan Vegan Cheese, which taught readers how to make cheeses from nut milk. Two years later she launched Miyoko’s Creamery. Based in Sonoma, California, the company makes vegan cheese and butter products sold in thousands of US stores, including Whole Foods and Target.
Schinner believes vegan cheese can be part of the climate solution. While cheese is often seen as less carbon intensive than meat, the dairy industry has a huge carbon footprint. Some cheeses have a larger greenhouse gas impact than pork or poultry.

From Germany to New York City, this summer has demonstrated the destructive force of floods. Now, a new study shows that many more people will live in flood-prone areas in the coming decade and reveals the population in areas likely to flood is increasing at a greater rate than other places.
The study, which was published in the journal Nature today, used daily satellite observations of floods during 913 large flood events between 2000 and 2018.

                    <span>Of all the athletes I have interviewed, boxers consistently defy their public image - and make for fabulously peaceful, thoughtful and rewarding company
In covering the Olympics for BBC Radio, it’s been my privilege to speak to all sorts of sportsmen and women. Once again, I’ve been reminded that boxers never give bad interviews. The latest one to impress me no end has been Karriss Artingstall, who won bronze in the featherweight division, missing out on a bout for gold after losing on points by a whisker in her semi-final. Artingstall, from Macclesfield, left school at 15, took up boxing, joined the army, where she’s a gunner in the Royal Horse Artillery, and eventually became an Olympian. Ben Whittaker, the light-heavyweight from the Black Country, wanted not only a gold medal but also to become mayor of Wolverhampton. Sadly, he lost in the final to Cuba’s Arlen López, something on which he wasn’t putting a brave face. “You don’t win silver; you lose gold,” he said. “I didn’t perform good. He’s a class operator but I’m very disappointed. I feel like a failure … I’m sorry for making you wake up and see me let you down.”
These are gifted amateurs but, as with the pros, there’s always a handy turn of phrase, some straight talking and a fascinating backstory. Of all the athletes I’ve been lucky enough to speak to – be they footballers, cricketers, golfers, tennis players or whoever – boxers are generally the most rewarding company. Outside the buildup to, and immediate aftermath of, big fights there’s a noticeable sense of thoughtfulness and peace about them.

Saied also suspended parliament for 30 days on 25 July, and has since dismissed four ministers and other top officials.

I spent my childhood in Madrid and I went to the Prado every week from the age of seven. I would cry at the works by Goya. His paintings of the Spanish war of independence moved me like nothing else. I never grew up around photography – I grew up around Goya. Even as a child, I was attracted to the dark fates of the world.
Over the course of my career, I’ve covered 13 conflicts, more than many of the famous war photographers of my generation. I’ve worked in Vietnam and Cambodia, Eritrea and Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iran. I’ve always tried to capture a glimpse of hope against a background of drama and destruction. That has not always been possible.

“In the Christian imagination,” says Lucy Walker’s voiceover, “hell is fire pits, it’s being burned alive. These are the very worst things we could imagine. When we came up with the idea of hell, it was fire that we imagined and that’s what we’re creating for ourselves.”
Walker is our guide into a modern Dante’s Inferno in her excruciatingly timely film Bring Your Own Brigade, which examines a world on fire by focusing on the savage blazes that tore through the California cities of Malibu and Paradise in November 2018.

These have been busy times for the rogue state of Belarus.
In recent days, an opposition activist, Vitaly Shyshov, was found dead – hanging from a tree in a park in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv – in what is now officially a murder case. Shyshov headed an NGO that helped Belarusians escape from the ever-increasing repression back home, having himself fled in 2020. The Olympic 200m sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya narrowly escaped being bundled on to a plane back home from Tokyo, and has been granted a humanitarian visa by Poland. And the EU commissioner for home affairs, Sweden’s Ylva Johansson, flew to Lithuania to try to do something about Belarus’s state-organised smuggling of migrants over the border into its neighbour (the government in Minsk has been accused of organising flights from Baghdad to Belarus: migrants are led by guides to the border, and the whole operation is advertised on social media).

                    <span>Until we shift the culture around baby loss, women will still feel abandoned, no matter how many times we say the taboo is being broken
Taboo is an overused word in the media, isn’t it? Miscarriage, in particular, is often described as one of the “last taboos”, although I’ve also seen the label attached to menopause, periods, post-natal depression, finances, pelvic organ prolapse and male incontinence. When Carrie Johnson announced last weekend that she was expecting another baby this Christmas following a miscarriage that she described as “heartbreaking”, the word surfaced again in headlines: “Carrie’s rainbow baby helps shatter the miscarriage taboo”. 
I understand the impulse to reach for this kind of language. When I had my first miscarriage, four years ago, it was as if I’d walked into a cave of white noise. Leaving the early pregnancy unit that day with nothing to show for my three-month pregnancy but a pair of hospital-issue paper pants and a flimsy information pamphlet, I felt numb and empty – emptied – and tried to recall a single conversation I’d had about this. The best I came up with was a few lines in an old episode of Sex and the City.

First the 28-year-old hopped on her left foot a dozen times, before flopping to the floor. Then, as the tears began to flow, she covered her eyes and took refuge in the dark. But when a wheelchair was rolled out, she was determined to go out on her feet.

Can anyone be truly baffled by chives, you wonder. Would anyone really not know what a whisk looks like? Or “a tong”? Would anyone actually rinse a turkey in bottled water? Or is it, must it all be part of the carefully curated act of idiot rich girl the presenter has been performing for the past 20 years?
All these issues and more are thrown up by watching Paris Hilton assemble basic meals – if we use the word “meal” in its loosest possible sense, to include cereal, marshmallow shapes and caviar – in her new Netflix series Cooking With Paris. “I love cooking but I’m not a trained chef,” she explains at the start. One of these things is true. But I’ll bet that Hilton, who clearly believes that edible glitter is a food group, no more loves cooking than I would love little rat dogs crapping in my handbags.

Great Britain’s Ben Maher produced a fast and fearless performance to secure showjumping gold on Explosion W in a jump-off at Tokyo Equestrian Park on Wednesday.
An astonishingly quick round by Maher and Explosion – they finished the course in 37.85sec – pipped the Swedish rider Peder Fredricson to the top spot by 17 hundredths of a second. The Netherlands’ Maikel van der Vleuten finished in bronze position.

The aubergine hasn’t always had the most pristine reputation. There was a time when eating one required a complicated dance of slicing and salting and draining to remove its unpleasant bitterness. Luckily, though, most mass-market aubergines available in the UK have now had the bitterness bred out of them, so aubergine dishes are no longer so frustratingly time-consuming.

                    <span>Holland Park school governors launch investigation after 26 former teachers’ claims
Governors at Holland Park school, a top London academy, have launched an independent investigation into allegations about the school’s “toxic” working environment under one of England’s most highly paid headteachers, and the incendiary claim that critical staff questionnaires were hidden from Ofsted inspectors.
Twenty-six of the school’s recently departed teachers have written to the chair of the governing body at Holland Park, whose recent parents include the cabinet minister Michael Gove and the former Commons speaker John Bercow, and separately to the government’s academy regulator, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), setting out detailed examples of what they describe as abuses of power by the headteacher, Colin Hall, and his senior team.

                    <span>Skateboard bronze medallist aged 13 fractured skull in 2020
‘I’m going to try surfing,’ says Brown on 2024 Olympics plans

What do you say when you’ve just become the youngest person ever to win an Olympic medal for Great Britain? For Sky Brown, the extraordinarily gifted kid who won bronze in the women’s park skateboarding, it was the same stuff any happy teenager might come out with. “I’m so stoked. I can’t believe it. It’s unbelievable. It’s like a dream.”
Brown, who turned 13 at the start of July, was not even the youngest athlete on the podium. The silver medal was won by Japan’s Kokona Hiraki, who is 12 until 26 August. The last athlete who won a medal that young did so at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

Ahead of a music video shoot on a leafy street in Kumasi, Ghana’s second city, Yaw Tog and his friends lounge on a kerb. Passersby approach the teenage star for pictures. “Fame is crazy, it came almost overnight,” he says. “I’m proud because I had a vision of what I wanted to do and I did it. Now we’re here.”
A year ago, the 18-year-old could move between classes relatively unnoticed around his high school campus, but his thin and unassuming figure is now impossible to hide. Yaw Tog, currently finishing his exams, is one of the most popular MCs emerging from the city’s booming asakaa scene – a Ghanaian take on the drill subgenre of rap that has earned the city’s young artists thousands of fans around the world.

                    <span>Apricots seem almost to have been created to be baked into cakes such as this summery tart, where they reveal their jammy sweetness to full effect
Apricots are one of those fruits that, in Britain at least, promise so much, yet often deliver minor disappointment: dreams of velvety, perfumed flesh are dashed in a single, stringy bite or, worse, an entire mouthful of bland, watery wool. Baked, however, they will usually yield to soft, jammy sweetness, and this lovely tart is an excellent way to showcase apricots at their best.

                    <span>At the holding facility for those who have crossed the Channel, I saw scores of vulnerable people being held in one small room
Migrants trying to enter the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats have created a huge political furore. To hear government ministers talk about “protecting our borders” you might imagine that these migrants were the D-day landings in reverse. It is true that number of migrants coming in small boats has risen. There have been an estimated 9,000 this year so far, from countries including Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria, which is more than the total for 2020 (though overall asylum applications to the UK have gone down). But having whipped up public hostility to these people, the government seems to think that if they do reach the UK they can be detained at Dover in quite shocking conditions.
I saw these conditions for myself last week as one of a group of members of parliament from the home affairs select committee who visited the holding facility in Dover. The facility was terrible. There were 56 people crammed into a small room, including women, young children and babies. They were sitting or lying on thin mattresses which covered the entire floor, including the aisles between a small number of seats. At night they would sleep on these same mattresses. Legally they are only supposed to be held for 24 hours in this facility. The Home Office official in charge explained that there was an administrative process whereby the time could be extended to 48 hours and longer if necessary. When I tried to get her to explain how long individual migrants were actually staying, she said that she did not know.

Villa have tried hard to keep Grealish, offering an improved deal, but a transfer for a record fee paid by an English club is poised to be completed. The 25-year-old has spent his whole career with his boyhood team.

I can still recall the phone call on 4 August 2011, informing me that police officers had been involved in the killing of an “armed gangster” who had allegedly shot at them. I was getting the call, from the chair of a policing advisory group, as this incident had taken place in Tottenham, north London, where for decades I have been an active campaigner for police accountability.
My initial reaction was surprise: it was extremely rare to hear that someone had fired at a police officer, let alone that they had been stupid enough to shoot at an armed unit. But my thought processes began to change when she went on to inform me that the gun that had allegedly been fired could not be found. Later, I received a second call telling me that the gun had been found, but that it was some distance away from the “gunman’s” body.

                    <span>The past 18 months have been intense and traumatic for everyone – and no profession has been affected more than nursing. Here is the inside story of a dreadful, dramatic time
It was the late May bank holiday of this year and Charlotte Hudd was supposed to be on a shift at the care home where she worked on the Isle of Wight. Instead, she was being wheeled from an ambulance into the A&amp;E department at St Mary’s hospital in Newport, the island’s county town, still wearing her nurse’s uniform.
Hudd had been worried about her job affecting her health for a while. Since catching Covid at work in January 2021, she had come to dread mornings when she would wake up feeling like “there was an elephant sitting on my chest”. There were heart palpitations, breathlessness, fatigue and a terrifying brain fog – an unwelcome window into what it must be like to have early onset dementia. It was worse on work days, anxiety adding to the mix.

Taking a stand against Donald Trump is guaranteed to bring Republicans online abuse, primary election challengers and barbs from the former US president himself. But it is also proving lucrative as donors scramble to breathe life into the anti-Trump resistance.
Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman from Wyoming and leading Trump critic, enjoyed her second consecutive record fundraising quarter with $1.88m from April to June, according to financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. She had raised $1.54m in the first three months of the year.

                    <span>When a lewd cartoon of Rupert Bear landed the editors of the 60s counterculture paper in court, David Hockney, John Lennon, Robert Crumb and more made some of their most urgent art in response
“What do you suppose is the effect intended to be of equipping Rupert Bear with such a large sized organ?”
Fifty years ago, this was the question put to expert witness Edward de Bono, under pain of perjury. The six-week trial of Oz magazine at the Old Bailey was the longest obscenity trial in England’s history. It remains the most absurd.

                    <span>This man was well endowed, highly sexed and lasted longer than me. Is our relationship doomed?
I have been with my partner for three years, and a month ago she cheated on me. We discussed the matter and from that I discovered that this guy she cheated with is well endowed, lasted longer than me and has a huge sex drive. She now wants us to fix things, but I am uncomfortable knowing all of this. I am afraid that I will not satisfy her and she may end up going back to this person and that I’ll be hurt. What can I possibly do to overcome all of this?
Don’t believe your partner’s description of the other guy. It sounds spiteful. Is there a reason why she would try to hurt you? Is she angry or resentful of you for some reason? It’s time for a calm talk to try to understand each other far better and to have a chance to express your true feelings without resorting to blaming or name-calling. Tell her honestly that you feel uncomfortable and afraid and say: “Please help me to understand your feelings too.” After a breach of trust it takes time to repair a damaged relationship and the hazy spectre of a rival’s dimensions is really the least of your worries.

                    <span>Its bungling over my late sister’s pension has been distressing
After my sister died in February, Legal &amp; General wrote to me, stating I was entitled to £14,000 from her pension plan. This was followed by documents I was required to submit, all of which were clearly intended for my son who has the same name, but a different address. I advised them of their mistake and they sent updated papers which, again, related to my son, and this time disclosed the amount. I called again, and was told I wasn’t a beneficiary after all.
Meanwhile, my bereaved 89-year-old father, who also shares my name, was notified that he was due to receive £19,000 from his daughter’s pension fund. Again, the letter was intended for my son, but L&amp;G had sent it to the wrong address.

                    <span>One year on from the huge explosion in the port of Beirut in Lebanon the devastation from the blast is still visible
At least 200 people were killed, and more than 6,000 injured in the Beirut blast that devastated the port area on 4 August 2020. The explosion is believed to have been caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse.
Away from the broken grain silos, and their rotting contents, Lebanon remains paralysed and anguished. The investigation into the blast has flatlined, and its perpetrators are as far away from accountability as ever. The global aid pledged in the wake of the destruction remains forsaken by the country’s rulers, who prefer the narrow privileges that flowed to them from a crippled system to a global rescue plan that could save the country.

                    <span>Social media brought me better jobs, close friends and love. But I was ignoring the ways in which the constant criticism and approval were shaping my life
In March 2009, I type in “twitter.com” and sign up for the next 12 years of my life. I am 20, in my first year of uni. I have three friends and hate it here. But, on Twitter, I can talk to real music journalists, my longed-for future people. Two years later, I move to London to work at NME. My social awkwardness makes life in a new city feel like dredging the Thames with baggy tights. On Twitter, however, I have blossomed into a magnificent little chaos magnet. Even on sad, drunk Friday nights in, my phone-sized kingdom glitters.
Real life improved, often thanks to Twitter. It led me to John, still my boyfriend 10 years on, and many of my closest friends. Thanks to being a woman in a male-dominated field, the odd viral review and little talent for discretion, I ended up with 60,000 followers. I didn’t take it that seriously, but acing my first popularity contest felt like winning Miss World, if she had bad posture and trigger-happy thumbs. Visibility brought better jobs and gave me a platform to retaliate against music’s many dirtbags. The mute button silenced reply guys and trolls, and I hadn’t searched my name in years, ever since John likened that always-upsetting habit to self-harm – an overstatement that nevertheless rang true.

When interaction between the generations is interrupted – and there doesn’t even have to be a pandemic; sometimes we just forget to call each other – it is easy for misunderstandings to flourish. Negative perceptions can build to such a pitch that, even if you had your grandchildren standing right in front of you, you possibly wouldn’t want to tackle them head-on. Or perhaps your perceptions aren’t negative – there are just pockets of puzzlement.
Four zoomers – Patrick Baggaley, Freya Scott-Turner, Rachel Ayo Ogunleye and Aidan Nylander, all born in 2000 – are here to clear up everything. Baggaley is a chef based in London; Scott-Turner is studying journalism and living in Cambridge; Ayo Ogunleye is studying medicine and based in Beckenham, south London; and Nylander is between two degrees and lives in Newcastle.

                    <span>She got gross-out laughs in Fresh Meat, died superbly in Call the Midwife – and now she’s back communing with spirits in Ghosts. Is Charlotte Ritchie getting too famous to buy her own leggings?


Charlotte Ritchie is video calling from her London flat, which she has shared with two friends for the past seven years. “How do I do this? Do I need to quit WhatsApp? OK! I’m here! I’m really sorry, I got my timings wrong,” she says, mildly flustered, having arrived barely a couple of minutes late. “I was very lazily putting on lunch, and then I thought it was later and … my bad.”
We only talk for an hour but it’s easy to see why her character George was adorned with a series of silly, effusive nicknames in the British comedy drama Feel Good: English rose; a little kidney bean; a Dangerous Mary Poppins. “The fit squirrel reference is good,” she adds. “And Dangerous Mary Poppins, I love that one!”

China’s Tencent tightens games controls for children

China’s regulators are on the march again, pushing one of the country’s most valuable technology companies, Tencent, into announcing fresh curbs designed to limit the time children spend playing its computer games. The announcement may have led to a collapse in Tencent’s shares, but the measures will be eyed with mild jealousy by many western parents.
Minors playing the company’s hit title Honor of Kings will now only be allowed to play for a single hour each day, and two hours on holidays. It will also block children under 12 from spending money in-game.

When his workplace blew to pieces, dockworker Yusuf Shehadi was waiting to hear back from colleagues who had scrambled to help firefighters extinguish a blaze in the port of Beirut. The fire was bad and getting worse, they told him in their last conversation before a giant explosion killed them, and 210 others, a year ago today.
The catastrophic blast laid to ruin the place Shehadi had worked for a decade. And he immediately knew its cause. “I had taken the nitrate from the dock to the hangar six years earlier,” he said of the massive stockpile of military-grade fertiliser that he had helped move from a freighter to a nearby hangar in 2014.

The US gymnast Simone Biles brought her Olympics to a close with a bronze medal in the balance beam. It came at the end of a turbulent few days in which she withdrew from her other events, citing concerns about her mental health. She told reporters: “I was just going out there doing this for me.”
Guardian sports writer Tumaini Carayol saw it all unfold at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre in Tokyo. He tells Nosheen Iqbal that the withdrawal of the greatest gymnast of all time came as a shock to everyone involved in the sport and prompted discussion about athletes’ mental health.

Thanks Tom. Onto day 12 we go. The Olympics is like a Groundhog Day of clusterfun, a wall-to-wall array of sports that we can treat more or less like a lolly shop. Or a sweets shop, depending on your locale. How good is it (note the absence of question mark). Before we carry on with the day’s events, a quick word on Australia’s men’s basketballers – speaking as a basketball fan as much as an Aussie, that last quarter against Argentina last night was as close to sporting eroticism as it gets. Dead set counting the seconds to tomorrow’s semi-final against the Americans.

Covid-19 hospitalizations are surging across the US and stretched hospitals are warning that the overwhelming majority of coronavirus patients are unvaccinated and their serious sickness preventable.
More than 50,000 people were hospitalized across the US as of Monday, according to the US health department. This is significantly fewer people than during the peak in cases, deaths and hospitalizations this January, but similar to the rates last summer when coronavirus vaccines were still in development.

Japan has carried out a threat to publicly shame people not complying with coronavirus border control measures, releasing the names of three people who broke quarantine rules after returning from overseas.
The health ministry said the three Japanese nationals named had clearly acted to avoid contact with authorities after recently returning from abroad.

Family, friends, campaigners, politicians and well wishers gathered at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, to honour the sisters and all women lost to male violence. The proceedings kicked off with Brent North MP Barry Gardiner singing Amazing Grace.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Children aged 16 and 17 across the UK could be given access to Covid vaccinations in the coming days, according to Nicola Sturgeon, after it emerged that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) was reconsidering its advice for young people.
Just two weeks after the body recommended against routine vaccination of children, the Scottish first minister revealed that she “hoped” over-16s would get the go-ahead to receive it after all.

A scientific discovery about Machu Picchu has cast doubt on the reliability of colonial records for modern western historians trying to piece together an understanding of the Inca people who built the site.
For more than 75 years, many historians and scientists have worked on the assumption that the famous site in Peru was built some time after AD1438. This was based primarily on 16th-century Spanish accounts from their conquest of the region. However, enhanced radiocarbon dating techniques carried out on remains have now found it could be at least two decades older.

The analysis was based on data collected between September 2020 and February 2021, coinciding with the reopening of schools in the autumn and the peak of the winter wave of the virus in the UK. It included data on 1,734 children from five to 17 years old.

People across Turkey are looking for answers as to how summer wildfires got so desperately out of control, after seven straight days of unusually ferocious fires that continue to blaze throughout the south and west of the country.
Eight people, including two firefighters, have died in the wildfires that have engulfed large parts of Turkey’s Mediterranean coastline since last week and destroyed huge swathes of pine forest and agricultural land. While 137 fires in more than 30 provinces have been extinguished, at least nine are still burning, and more than 10,000 people have yet to return to damaged homes, resorts and hotels evacuated in the middle of the tourism season.

                    <span>The one-man A-Team is back on TV … except this time she’s a woman vigilante, defying a clunky script to tackle shady villains and deliver justice for those in need
First The Equalizer was Edward Woodward. He equalised things on television from 1985 to 1989 – a one-man A-Team without the van. Then The Equalizer moved to film in the 10s and became Denzel Washington, who broke with tradition by being a person of colour and a person who could act. Now, it has moved back to television, with the singer turned actor Queen Latifah taking up the mantle in this new series, airing in the UK on Sky Witness.
Queen Latifah (who also executive produces) stars as Robyn McCall, a charity worker who has left her job to spend more time with her magnificently stroppy teenage daughter, Delilah (Laya DeLeon Hayes). At least, that is what she would have those around her believe. In fact, she is a disillusioned covert operative for the US government who has quit over ethical concerns about the illegal operations she has been required to carry out.

                    <span>Bryan Nellist’s white gooseberry won the growers’ prize by a fraction of a gram at the tense Egton Bridge competition
An 85-year-old awarded the trophy for heaviest gooseberry has expressed his pride, saying he thought his “winning days had come to an end”.
Bryan Nellist’s victory, in the Yorkshire hamlet of Egton Bridge near Whitby on Tuesday, went to the wire, decided by a “berry-off” that came down to fractions of a gram between his white gooseberry – of a variety known as Belmarsh – and its rival.

                    <span>Rugby League World Cup expected to be postponed until 2022
RFL keen to have England play at home this autumn

An extension to the Super League season and last-minute England matches this autumn are under consideration as it appears inevitable this year’s Rugby League World Cup will be postponed on Wednesday.
Despite attempting to stage the tournament without Australia and New Zealand, who confirmed last month they would not send squads to England for the tournament due to player welfare concerns regarding Covid-19, World Cup organisers are expected to concede at a board meeting on Wednesday afternoon that they have been left with no option but to postpone until 2022. That leaves an almighty hole in the calendar in October and November which the Rugby Football League will now try to fill.

The Pentagon, the headquarters of the US military, was temporarily placed on lockdown after gunshots were fired Tuesday morning near the entrance of the building.

Iranian-backed forces are suspected of being behind the seizure of a tanker off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, after Britain’s maritime trade agency reported a “potential hijack” in the area on Tuesday by eight to nine armed individuals.
Maritime security sources identified the vessel as the Panama-flagged asphalt tanker that was reportedly intercepted in an area in the Arabian Sea leading to the strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s seaborne oil exports flow.

BP raises dividend and unveils share buyback

It’s hard to keep up with oil companies’ dividend policies. One minute they’re slashing payments to shareholders in the face of a pandemic that, supposedly, had permanently lowered the outlook for oil prices. The next they’re saying the coast is clear and divis can rise again.
Shell last week provided a classic example of this stop-start approach when, having cut by two-thirds last year, it announced a 38% increase. BP offered a less chaotic picture on Tuesday but the basic plot was similar. Last year’s halving of the divi was followed by a 4% increase, rather than the previously flagged zero.

But in the week since withdrawing from the Olympic gymnastics team final to protect her physical and mental health – a brave decision made against the backdrop of unhinged takes from people who couldn’t attempt a cartwheel – the transcendent Simone Biles didn’t just tarry at the Tokyo Games. She hung around the Ariake Gymnastics Centre to cheer on her USA teammates. She hopped on Instagram to break down the “twisties,” that out-of-body experience that suddenly made her feel so lost while spinning in the air and so fearful she wouldn’t land firmly on her feet. “For anyone saying I quit,” Biles wrote. “I didn’t quit.”

When it comes to selection for the final Test of a British &amp; Irish Lions series, Warren Gatland has historically proved a shrewd operator. In 2013 his reshuffled Lions, containing six starting personnel changes as is also now the case, trounced the Wallabies 41-16. Four years ago the All Blacks also proved unable to seal a series most had expected them to win.
It is perhaps in that context that Gatland’s last spin of the 2021 roulette wheel – and almost certainly of his Lions’ career – should be viewed. This is a head coach who has been in this type of unforgiving casino before and opted for some brave punts which, subsequently, came up trumps. He has long had an intuitive feel for exactly what it takes to emerge in credit on the biggest of occasions.

The developer of Pokémon Go is facing a player revolt after rolling back safety measures implemented at the onset of the pandemic last year. 
Niantic, the Google subsidiary which released the smash hit mobile game in 2016, had reacted to the onset of the pandemic by tweaking how its games work. The introduction of social distancing and stay-at-home orders around the world made it hard to play the company’s augmented reality (AR) games as intended, since they task players with leaving their homes and visiting local landmarks to catch Pokémon, gather items, and fight for regional dominance.

                    <span>Days of chaos over the traffic light system have highlighted divisions and distrust at the heart of government
Throughout the pandemic, Boris Johnson and his ministers have repeatedly been guilty of chaotic messaging, fostering uncertainty where clarity was needed. This summer, true to form, there has been unnecessary confusion over the requirement to isolate when pinged, muddle over mask wearing as Covid restrictions eased and the bewildering saga of the baroque “traffic light” system for foreign travel.
Mr Johnson’s summary ditching of a proposed “amber watchlist” category – warning that a given destination may soon enter the red list – removes the prospect of another layer of jeopardy for holidaymakers planning trips. This is good news for airlines and the travel industry. But the system, with its existing five categories of risk, remains absurdly complicated. And most importantly, the risk of importing new variants remains. It would have been useful to know the views of the chief of the Joint Biosecurity Centre, whose job, after all, is to advise on travel rules. But as the Guardian revealed on Tuesday, Clare Gardiner, the previous incumbent of the post, quietly quit in June. She has yet to be replaced.

It’s not often that a bronze medal becomes one of the biggest stories of an Olympic Games. But the return of Simone Biles to the Ariake centre in Tokyo on Tuesday to take part in the balance beam final after withdrawing from five other events would have made headlines even had she not ended the session smiling on the podium, clutching medal and sunflowers.
It was a fabulous finish to an incredibly difficult few days for Biles, who won the same medal in Rio in 2016 along with four golds. For fans, the bounceback is bound to raise hopes that the 24-year-old may not be about to retire from the sport she loves, but which has taken a toll on her mind and body. (Another gymnast, Italy’s Vanessa Ferrari, won silver in the floor event aged 30.) But while it is impossible not to be thrilled that Biles was able to compete, her experience resonates because of what she didn’t achieve as well as what she did.

                    <span>Residents north of Greek capital evacuated, while 42C heat forces Acropolis to reduce opening hours
Thousands of people have fled their homes north of Athens after a forest wildfire reached residential areas. The hurried evacuations took place just as Greece grappled with its worst heatwave in decades.
The blaze sent a huge cloud of smoke over Athens and prompted multiple evacuations near Tatoi, 13 miles to the north. Residents left their homes in cars and on motorcycles, heading toward the capital in a blanket of smoke.

                    <span>Swede had three attempts at 6.19cm after securing gold medal
‘Damn I’m glad it’s over, I can chill now and enjoy the moment’

By 10pm the track was bare, the hammer cage was empty, the shot-put circle was deserted, and Mondo Duplantis had the Olympic stadium all to himself. Duplantis, 21, had already won the gold, with a vault of 6.02m, a height well beyond the reach of most of the men he had already beaten but which, for him, is little more than a warm-up. Duplantis asked the officials to put the bar up again, all the way to 6.19cm, one centimetre beyond the world record he set in Glasgow last year. With his first attempt, he brushed the bar with his thigh on the way down, then he bailed out of the second, and clipped the bar again with his third.

A convicted terrorist who was shot dead by police after going on a stabbing rampage had signalled his intention before he was released from prison to “commit jihad” and “kill the Queen”, an inquest has heard.
Sudesh Amman, 20, was killed by undercover police on Streatham High Road in south London on 2 February 2020 after stealing a knife and injuring members of the public at random in broad daylight.

Opinion: Britain could be taking the lead in tackling the climate crisis. Where’s the ambition?

Vital UN climate talks are at risk of failure because Boris Johnson is “missing in action” while his climate spokesperson talks about freezing bread, Keir Starmer has warned.
The Labour leader said there is already “dystopia” all around caused by climate breakdown, but Johnson’s ambition to tackle the scale of the crisis is irresponsibly small.

Ministers in England are preparing to decide which countries should have tougher quarantine requirements imposed for travellers returning home from them, amid criticism the system has been thrown into “chaos”.
Senior members of the cabinet will meet to mull over the latest case, vaccine and variant rates in territories across the world and are expected to make an announcement about changes to the red, amber and green lists later on this week.

On 4 August it will be 10 years since police shot dead Mark Duggan in Tottenham Hale (Conditions that led to 2011 riots still exist today, experts warn, 30 July). It is true that things have changed since the shooting and the events that followed it. Tottenham became a centre for craft beer and London’s only urban cheesemaker. New multi-storey flats surround my central Tottenham abode, very few affordable for existing inhabitants.
But none of that, as David Lammy argues (A decade after Tottenham burned, social alienation means riots could happen again, 30 July), is of much use to those – far too many – who have to rely on food banks to get by and whose future job opportunities look difficult at best.

I read your article (MPs enjoy free tickets worth £100k during Covid large event pilots, 30 July) with amazement. In my early years as an NHS consultant, I was the recipient of such freebies from big pharma and other medical industries, but by the time I retired (in the last century), such hospitality was rightly seen as corrupting and was banned. To see that for politicos of all shades it is today “within the rules” when “fully declared” indicates that the rules need urgent revision.
Michael Ruttley
Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan
• Politicians seem to be more remote from public opinion than ever. We talk about taking “freebies” – but these particular gifts were made in the context of a review of the gambling laws. Members of parliament are supposed to police gambling, not profit from it. The fact that an MP has declared a gift is irrelevant except that it indicates an ongoing contempt of the voters, which was exemplified by the expenses scandal.

One fine leap for Ese Brume. One giant step for Nigeria’s bedraggled Olympics. Nine days into Tokyo 2020 the Giant of Africa, a nation that fizzes with sporting talent of all types, had finally won a medal at these Games.
Brume’s opening jump of 6.97 metres in the women’s long jump final at the Tokyo Olympic Stadium on Tuesday morning was enough to keep her in the bronze medal spot behind Germany’s Malaika Mihambo, who won gold, and Brittney Reese of the USA. Ten hours later Nigeria had doubled its tally as Blessing Oborududu took silver in the freestyle wrestling at the Makuhari Messe Hall after a storming run to the final.

The elevation of Angus Lapsley is now understood to be unlikely but not definitely ruled out in light of the unfortunate episode, in which the mislaid paperwork – some of which was marked secret – discussed sensitive deployments in Afghanistan and the Black Sea.

                    <span>A Northern Irish town with ties to vampiric lore has an uninvited guest in a funny if sometimes unbalanced film that channels Shaun of the Dead
Demolishing an ancient cairn is definitely high on the list of things people in horror movies should never do. Especially when the one out in the field near sleepy backwater Six Mile Hill supposedly houses Abhartach, reputedly the original inspiration for Dracula – a scary story that Eugene Moffat (Jack Rowan) and friends enjoy winding up tourists with down their local, the Stoker. When his best mate William winds up impaled on the stones on a boozy walk home, and Eugene’s attempted demolition job makes matters worse, the entire construction team must figure out how to put this haemoglobin-hoovering abomination back underground.
It’s surprising that Shaun of the Dead’s casual Brit domestication of the zombie apocalypse hasn’t spawned more imitators. So it’s cheering, after the gore starts to fly in this Northern Irish vampire flick, to hear bluff construction foreman Francie Moffat (Nigel O’Neill) announce there’s some “serious craic” afoot. Chris Baugh’s film doesn’t balance its piss-taking and blood-sucking duties with as much comedy-horror sprezzatura as Edgar Wright does – but sloshes enough briny humour around to make it more than passable craic itself.

                    <span>By suggesting they both win, Mutaz Barshim and Gianmarco Tamberi have helped to upturn preconceptions about success
“Can we have two golds?” Mutaz Barshim of Qatar’s words during the men’s high jump competition, spoken to the friend with whom he was tied in first place, Italy’s Gianmarco Tamberi, have surely marked one of the most heartwarming moments of the Olympics so far. They both had achieved jumps of 2.37 metres. They could have settled it with a jump off. But instead, they chose to share, celebrating not only their sporting prowess, but also their friendship. “Sharing with a friend is even more beautiful … It was just magical,” Tamberi said. “This is beyond sport,” Barshim added. “This is the message we deliver to the young generation.”
It may not be in the spirit of ancient Greek heroism – but then we’re not sacrificing oxen in honour of Zeus any more, either. In the modern age, there is a long history of medal sharing, and the Olympic spirit – or Olympism – as established by Pierre de Coubertin emphasised solidarity, peace and humanism. Barshim and Tamberi’s act is hardly out of step with tradition, but it will still have its detractors. It goes against the grain of what spectators have come to expect from elite sport: a narrative where there is one winner, one hero, one champion to rule them all. It’s a poignant gesture in this year in particular, which has seen collective action and solidarity become so important.

                    <span>In new BBC show Blind Ambition, MacDonald and Jamie O’Leary meet artists who have lost their sight – including a rapper, a photographer and a wood turner ‘who still has all his fingers’

I’m a blind standup comedian, currently co-starring in the BBC Two documentary Blind Ambition. As the title suggests, the show is about blindness. But please don’t think this is a violins, tissues at the ready, “oh didn’t they do well” type of documentary. The show creator and Essex wide boy Jamie O’Leary wanted to make a different kind of show about disability. 
You’ll know the classic disabled show formula: person has a dark phase then overcomes their disability and achieves something wonderful. In this paradigm the disability is a hurdle that needs to be jumped over. Or, if there are mobility issues at play, an obstacle to get around. In the Blind Ambition paradigm, blindness – a disability readers of the New York Times voted the worst thing a person could have in the world (which is bollocks as blind people can’t read the flipping New York Times so couldn’t vote) – is positive.

The 32-year-old won bronze at the 2008 Games in Beijing before becoming the light-welterweight champion at London 2012.
Iglesias is now one of 10 boxers to have won medals at three Olympic Games and the Cuban sealed his place in the pantheon with a sumptuous performance that showcased so much of the slick skill and fighting grit of the greatest amateur boxing country in the world.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The legal requirement for physical distancing in Scotland will be removed from next week, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she confirmed the country would move beyond level 0 of the Scottish government’s five-tier system of Covid controls from 9 August.
Blanket self-isolation for school pupils will also be scrapped in an attempt to avoid continued educational disruption: when Scottish schools return over the next two weeks, pupils will no longer be required to isolate for 10 days when someone in their bubble tests positive for Covid, as long as they test negative themselves.

On a day that looks to have marked the end of Great Britain’s dominance of track cycling at Olympic level, there were symbols aplenty that the world has moved on, beyond the bald facts of the medal table. Dramatic crashes involving the men’s and women’s team pursuit squads closed the run of Olympic Games when one British gold medal followed another in seamless style, the hallmark of the track action in Beijing, London and Rio.
In all the chaos, the sprinter Jason Kenny became Britain’s most decorated Olympian with his eighth medal in total, a silver in the team sprint, putting him level with Bradley Wiggins; Kenny remains level with Chris Hoy on six golds. While his wife, Laura, pushed her medal tally upwards with a silver in the team pursuit, Tokyo marked the end of her remarkable unbeaten Olympic run. It will be scant consolation for an athlete of her competitive spirit but it required an astonishing world record from Germany to deny her a fifth gold in five attempts.

                    <span>Some people have been wearing disguises to vaccine appointments, because they don’t want to be seen by anti-vax friends. The culprit? Culture war capitalism

The hottest summer accessories for people who don’t want to die a horrible death but are ashamed to admit it? A wig and dark glasses. It has been reported that some people in Missouri, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the US, are wearing disguises to their vaccine appointments because they are terrified their anti-vaxxer friends and family might find out that they are protecting themselves from a deadly virus. A local healthcare provider has even started advertising “discreet” appointments for people who want to keep their shot secret. “If you are afraid of walking into a public area where you might be seen getting your vaccine, we will work to accommodate even more of a private setting for you to receive your vaccine,” Ozarks Healthcare said in a statement.
So this is the latest inane chapter of the culture wars, eh? Vaccines have become so politicised that the US is now having to provide safe spaces for people worried that they will be ostracised by their peers for believing in science. I would love to say I feel sympathy towards these people, but the seemingly never-ending pandemic has drained me of patience; stories like this just make me irate. If I were a pharmacist at that Missouri hospital, I would be tempted to grab the stealth-vaccinators by their collars and scream: “FACTS DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR IGNORANT FRIENDS’ FEELINGS!” (You can see why I have never successfully worked in a customer-facing environment.) There are millions of people around the world who don’t have access to a vaccine and would proudly get one. Treating a lifesaving shot like a dirty little secret is the height of privilege.

Italian director Lucio Fulci’s dusty giallo thriller from 1977 – also known as Murder to the Tune of the Seven Black Notes – has been retrieved from the shelf of some rights holder’s back catalogue and spruced up for rerelease. That gives us all a chance to appreciate, either anew or for the first time, its glorious deployment of tacky camera zooms, lurid colours and dubbed dialogue – the latter being a particularly evocative hallmark of 1970s Italian cinema, just a fraction out of sync with the actors’ lip movements.

What fruits are worth freezing now to eat later in the year?
Emma, Somerset
Being overrun with berries and cherries is a nice problem, but Emma is eminently sensible to want to freeze some for future cooking before they spoil. First up, wash, dry and prep the fruit: nectarines, peaches and the like should be stoned and sliced or chopped, and melon cut into chunks. “Hull strawberries, top and tail gooseberries, and stone cherries, then put them in ziplock bags in a single, flat layer,” says Anna Higham, executive pastry chef at The River Cafe in London. (Make sure you remove as much air from the bags as you can, too, to minimise freezer burn.)

                    <span>Few locals want to see the MSG Sphere entertainment venue built, but Newham council has little power to stop it

Lyn Brown is the Labour MP for West Ham

When London bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, we were driven not just by sporting desire, but by a vision for a regenerated east London after decades of deindustrialisation and deprivation. We were promised not just new infrastructure and economic growth, but the opportunity to genuinely improve the lives of local residents, including those who suffered dislocation and disruption to create the new Olympic venues. Most local people passionately supported the bid and the Games on this premise. Yet, while the Games did bring significant investment into Newham, there have been clear failures to benefit local people in the years since the closing ceremonies.
Delivering a lasting, positive legacy for the Olympic site was a job entrusted to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), established by Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, with the promise that local people really would benefit from the impact of the Games. For the most part, the opportunities created have remained out of reach for most local people. Rents and living costs have risen rapidly in the area but these have not been matched by sufficient wage increases or enough accessible new jobs, let alone enough affordable and social housing.

Coronavirus – latest updates

After a poll revealed that nearly two-thirds of working mothers do not have enough childcare during the school summer holidays this year, three parents describe the childcare challenges they will be facing this summer, and how they have been affected since the pandemic began.
Marie, 40, from Sheffield, is mainly struggling to secure adequate holiday childcare for her three-year-old.

A fourth police officer who defended the US Capitol during the 6 January insurrection by extremist supporters of Donald Trump is now confirmed to have taken his own life.
Washington DC’s Metropolitan police department (MPD) confirmed late Monday that another of their officers, Kyle DeFreytag, died by suicide earlier in July, just hours after declaring that MPD officer Gunther Hashida killed himself on 29 July.

This confusing concoction of cabaret, holiday camp entertainment, panto and pub act fails to showcase its talented illusionists
The first thing to say about Wonderville is that the magic is good. Coloured handkerchiefs turn into fluttering doves. Someone is sawn in half, another squeezed to a fraction of his size. Chris Cox reads the audience’s mind with boggling accuracy. There are few surprises but it is still technically complicated stuff and the illusionists stump up.
The magic is not the problem. The show, directed by Annabel Mutale Reed, is presented as a variety performance but it feels ad hoc and suffers from not having a broader, joined-up story or theme.

This high-octane, low-intelligence arcade sci-fi shooter is set in a neon-lit city whose upper levels house the wealthy while the impoverished live in sewers 
When I was a kid, nothing beat our family’s weekly pilgrimage to the local video store Vidbiz. While my parents pondered which thriller to digest with their takeaway, I’d gawp at the colourful PlayStation games on the corner shelf. Game rentals let me embark on interactive adventures I could otherwise never have afforded – while consuming an entire share-size pack of Sour Skittles in the process. Xbox’s Game Pass subscription gives me a similar buzz, offering a library of games to choose from and giving players the chance to try out odd or middling games that they’d never actually buy.
Sci-fi shooter The Ascent is a good example, the equivalent of a high-octane but intellectually bereft action flick. It is flawed but fun and atmospheric, set in a predictably bleak urban dystopia full of indentured workers, shady mega-corporations and augmented outlaws. Developer Neon Giant has dressed up The Ascent’s loot-driven blasting as an anti-capitalist critique: the class divide is built into planet Veles’s sleazy cyberpunk architecture. Its most impoverished inhabitants are banished to the sewers while wealthy citizens dwell in the districts above. As you climb your way up this tower-like metropolis, your grizzled mercenary fights tooth and nail to slowly – and literally – ascend to the upper echelons of society.

                    <span>Best known for their global No 1 in 1987, the Los Angeleno band first emerged through the phlegm of the punk movement and are now returning to their roots
Los Lobos reached pop’s pinnacle in 1987 when their cover of La Bamba, recorded for a film of the same name, reached No 1 around the world. On their way up, and indeed back down the other side, the Los Angeles roots-rockers have mastered multiple musical styles during nearly 50 years together – from traditional Mexican folk to jump blues and avant-rock – and have earned 11 Grammy nominations (with three wins), working or appearing with Paul Simon, the Clash, film-maker Robert Rodriguez and more along the way.
Now, to move forward, Los Lobos decided to look back. Native Sons, their 17th studio album, is a wide-ranging celebration of the LA artists that inspired the band early on. With covers of well-known pop tunes by the Beach Boys (Sail on Sailor) and Buffalo Springfield (For What It’s Worth) sitting alongside rare cuts from 60s garage rockers Thee Midniters and Latin jazz legend Willie Bobo, it’s the perfect polyglot collection for this multi-faceted ensemble. “You wouldn’t run into [these artists] at the same party,” says guitarist Louie Pérez Jr. “But once they all got to the party, everyone in the band thought, ‘Hey, this is kind of fun.’”

Noel Clarke has left his production company, Unstoppable Film and TV, after allegations of bullying and sexual misconduct first reported in the Guardian in April.
Clarke, 45, has left the firm – which produced his Sky series Bulletproof as well as films including Adulthood and Brotherhood – along with co-founder Jason Maza, 34. The company was founded by the pair in 2017, and was backed by the “super indie” distributor All3Media, who confirmed their departure in a statement to Variety. Clarke and Maza had been suspended from the company after the Guardian’s initial reporting.

                    <span>Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma show promisingly grim tendencies in a supremely confident horror that lacks a bit of thematic bite 
Teddy. The name is all wrong for the teenager at the centre of this French arthouse horror: a shaven-headed heavy metaller. Teddy is not cuddly nor particularly lovable, but he does turn furry by the light of the full moon. He’s a werewolf, though young film-making brothers Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma are too classy – and sensible – to reveal much more than a flash of bony wolf-foot when Teddy transforms.
The film is in fact a supremely confident genre dice and splice from the Boukhermas: a social realist body-horror black comedy with elements of coming-of-age drama. It reminded me a bit of Julia Ducournau’s cannibal movie Raw, but I’m not sure it’s got quite as much to say. Anthony Bajon is electrifying as Teddy, a high school dropout from a poor family. He lives with his disabled aunt and heavy-drinking uncle (Ludovic Torrent); “We’re the village idiots,” says Teddy. Knowing what everyone in town thinks of his family, Teddy petulantly acts up to the part of mindless yob. He is also the world’s worst temp at massage parlour Ghislaine’s Nimble Fingers, where owner Ghislaine (Noémie Lvovsky) is a lazily predictable stereotype of the gagging-for-it middle-aged woman.

Cubans used to joke about Napoleon Bonaparte chatting to Mikhail Gorbachev, George W Bush and Fidel Castro in the afterlife. “If I’d have had your prudence, I’d never have fought Waterloo,” the French emperor tells the last Soviet leader. “If I’d have had your military might, I’d have won Waterloo,” he tells the Texan. Turning last to Castro, the emperor says: “If I’d have had Granma [the Cuban Communist party daily], I’d have lost Waterloo but nobody would have known.”
The joke no longer does the rounds. With millions of Cubans now online, the state’s monopoly on mass communication has been deeply eroded. But after social media helped catalyse historic protests on the island last month, the government temporarily shut the internet down.

                    <span>As the largest wildfire in the US burns, a team of volunteers is supplementing the work done by larger aid groups – seeking out the most desperate and hardest to reach
Valerie O’Dai takes a drag from her cigarette at a donation site in Bly, Oregon, black sunglasses on, ash smeared across her face. She hasn’t showered or seen her husband and children in almost 48 hours. Firefighters may be gaining ground against the Bootleg fire, the largest wildfire currently burning in the US, but the urgency of her work has just begun.
She leans out the side door of her lifted Chevy truck, emblazoned with “Relief Angels” in blue letters, and waits for a phone call, an update on a big donation. Her crisis response team delivers aid to victims of natural disaster in the rural Pacific north-west, to the people O’Dai says are often the most desperate and hardest to reach.

                    <span>As two women are rescued in Syria after being kidnapped by Isis years earlier, Yazidis renew calls for international help to find the thousands still unaccounted for

For seven years, their families waited and hoped for news. In July, they finally received it. Two young women, kidnapped by Islamic State as teenagers, had been found alive in Syria.
Salma*, now 25, was located in Deir el-Zour province, in the east of the country. She had “suffered all kinds of injustice”, said the Yazidi House in the Al-Jazira region, an organisation that assisted with the rescue of both women.

                    <span>With various left and soft left groups on the sidelines, the party’s right is in the ascendant
Recent developments in the Labour party have once again highlighted how, despite the leader’s promise to end factionalism, internal divisions are alive and well. The party agreed last month to ban four groups, leading to the automatic expulsion of members – expected to reach 1,000, though this figure hasn’t been confirmed – on the party’s left. The groups are Socialist Appeal, a Trotskyist group considered a successor to Militant; Labour Against the Witchhunt, which believes many Labour antisemitism claims were fabricated for political reasons; Labour in Exile Network, a defender of those suspended or expelled from Labour; and Resist, the project of ex-MP Chris Williamson, intended to become a registered political party.
These now-proscribed organisations are small and you could forgive even the most active Labour member for never having heard of some of them. But, by and large, the Labour left opposed the bans: they believe that a “guilt by association” rule is unfair and suspect this is only the start of a slippery slope, with bigger groups critical of Keir Starmer at risk of being ousted next. A panel has been set up to consider further proscriptions. It is worth taking this moment to review how, as a new leadership has changed Labour’s internal dynamics, key organisations within Labour have been bolstered and others weakened.

Every morning, Mauro Morandi woke up to the uninterrupted sea view that only he was privy to. Immersed in nature, he was intimately in tune with the dawn sounds and habits of the wildlife that surrounded his home, a former second world war shelter on Budelli, the Mediterranean island where he had lived alone for more than 30 years.
Now the 82-year-old is adjusting to life in a one-bedroom apartment next to a shop with a Sky TV sign outside, surrounded by neighbours and with only a glimpse of the ocean in between the gaps separating the buildings opposite on nearby La Maddalena, the largest of an archipelago of seven islands off the north coast of Sardinia, Italy.

Whether with a private therapist on Zoom, through an app that daily reminds us to log our emotions, or in a back-and-forth with a chatbot, teletherapy is often proffered as a catch-all salve for our current mental healthcare crises. Remote treatment is touted as an efficient way to reach more patients in a time of extreme difficulty, an intimate intervention that can scale.
During the on-and-off mandated social distancing that has marked the past 18 months of the pandemic, teletherapy has shed its status as a minor form of care to become, at times, the only thing on offer. The popularity of remote therapeutic sessions has soared in the US and the “users” we once called patients are increasingly comfortable with such practices, and in some cases even prefer them.

Can you please help me as BT is chasing me for £348 in early termination fees despite previously telling me that it would forgo these charges. The broadband service provided to my house had always been poor but after I had open-heart surgery four years ago, I needed a service that worked. After repeated attempts by BT to improve matters, I eventually switched to Sky, which improved matters somewhat.
At the time, BT said I could leave penalty-free, and staff told me to ignore any bills that were sent. However, the company’s most recent letter said it will pass the matter to debt collectors if the bill is not paid with seven days.

If you were to blindfold me and drop me unexpectedly almost anywhere in the New Forest, I think I would know, the moment I unmasked myself, where I had arrived. It is such a distinctive landscape, with its unmistakable blend of wide-open pasture woodland filled with ancient trees and dead wood, swathes of gently rolling lowland heath studded with grazing ponies, winding streams of red-tinged water, and boggy hollows in valley bottoms.
It is a landscape in which I instinctively feel an immediate sense of belonging. I grew up not far away, and visited regularly throughout my childhood, so the place is filled with early memories of wandering in the unfenced forest and seeing birds and animals I had no hope of spotting at home. As soon as I was old enough, I would come to camp and explore alone.

                    <span>UFO sightings, a Nazi invasion, nerve gas trials, unexploded bombs … the strange Suffolk enclave of Orford Ness has always inspired artists, and now it hosts the most unsettling project yet 
It is one of Britain’s strangest landscapes, a spit of land off the Suffolk coast littered with the rusting junk of a mysterious and sinister past. Over the decades, musicians, film-makers, artists and writers have been sucked into its ghostly orbit, captivated by what the great existential wanderer WG Sebald imagined as “the remains of our own civilisation after its extinction in some future catastrophe”.
It’s now a nature reserve, but for much of the 20th century, Orford Ness was forbidden territory, sealed off for military purposes from the village whose picture-book church and castle can be seen from its desolate shingle beach. In 2014, Anya Gallaccio captured the decades of anxiety surrounding Ness with a series of hugely magnified photographs of a pebble believed to have been fractured by first world war bomb experiments. Jamiroquai used its strange colonnaded pagodas – designed in the 1950s to collapse in on themselves if a nuclear experiment went wrong – for the dystopian video of Automaton.

This month it is worth turning your eyes to the night sky to watch the spectacular Perseid meteor shower. Peak viewing time will be around 12 August, when as many as 150 meteors an hour will whizz overhead. Generated by Earth passing through the debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle, these meteors are a reliable event, but other meteors, such as the fireball that recently lit up southern Norway, are more random.
Most meteors burn themselves out in the atmosphere, but thousands of tons of cosmic dust do still make it to Earth’s surface every year. New research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that the number of meteorite strikes has stayed surprisingly constant for millions of years.

She was 14 when she was taken, along with 29 others, in the middle of the night. During the next eight years in captivity she was subjected to beatings, starvation, rape and other horrors that she cannot talk about even 18 years later. Five of the girls who were taken prisoner with her died, and Nyanjura gave birth to two children.

                    <span>To every age dogged with pollution, accidents and congestion, the transport solution for the next generation seems obvious – but the same problems keep coming back
In the 1890s, the biggest cities of the western world faced a mounting problem. Horse-drawn vehicles had been in use for thousands of years, and it was hard to imagine life without them. But as the number of such vehicles increased during the 19th century, the drawbacks of using horses in densely populated cities were becoming ever more apparent.
In particular, the accumulation of horse manure on the streets, and the associated stench, were impossible to miss. By the 1890s, about 300,000 horses were working on the streets of London, and more than 150,000 in New York City. Each of these horses produced an average of 10kg of manure a day, plus about a litre of urine. Collecting and removing thousands of tonnes of waste from stables and streets proved increasingly difficult.

Governments and businesses hoping to plant trees and restore forests in order to reach net-zero emissions must sharply limit such efforts to avoid driving up food prices in the developing world, the charity Oxfam has warned.
Planting trees has been mooted as one of the key ways of tackling the climate crisis, but the amount of land needed for such forests would be vast, and planting even a fraction of the area needed to offset global greenhouse gas emissions would encroach on the land needed for crops to feed a growing population, according to a report entitled Tightening the net: Net zero climate targets implications for land and food equity.

                    <span>It can feel as if the generation gap is wider than ever – but not when people really talk. Here, four sixtysomethings offer advice to those in their teens and 20s
We live in an era in which, for the most part, the generations do not mix frequently. Grandparents are visited occasionally; young people seek the freedom of independent living as early as possible. On social media, intergenerational warfare is commonplace, as members of gen Z (those born between the mid-90s and the early 10s) criticise older people for hoarding wealth, while baby boomers bemoan the perceived sensitivity of the younger generation.
But what would happen if baby boomers gave the TikToking young adults of today an insight into their thinking – and threw some life advice into the bargain? To that end, we assembled a panel of baby boomers – Tayo Idowu, 64, a marketing director from London; Liz Richards, 68, a retired nurse from Derby; Paul Gibson, 63, an accountant from Arundel, West Sussex; and Maggie Tata, 65, a carer from London – to answer gen Z’s questions (even the tongue-in-cheek ones).

Spartaco Perini spoke overwhelmingly about his time as a second world war resistance fighter in the days before he died. The founder of one of Italy’s first antifascism groups in Colle San Marco, a hamlet of Ascoli Piceno in the central Marche region, he was lauded by the Allied forces for his role as a fearless informant, work that helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis and end Benito Mussolini’s dictatorship. But he had one regret.
“In his last few days, he spoke a lot about the great things the partisans did to restore freedom and bring about democracy,” said Pietro Perini, the partisan’s son and president of the Ascoli Piceno unit of Anpi, an anti-fascism organisation. “But he also felt they made one error – and that was not to have eradicated it [fascism] completely.”

                    <span>Plans to update and expand the Official Secrets Act have been attacked as a ‘licence for cover-ups’ that could be used to thwart legitimate investigative journalism
 In recent years, some of the biggest scoops in investigative journalism have come about because someone inside government or the intelligence services has leaked sensitive information. There was Edward Snowden revealing the scale of mass surveillance being carried out by western governments, and more recently, leaks exposing who was getting lucrative state Covid contracts. 
Now, though, investigative journalists in the UK are looking worriedly at a consultation from the Home Office related to plans it has to update the Official Secrets Act. This law, created in 1911 and last updated in 1989, makes it a criminal offence for government officials to reveal certain kinds of classified information – and for journalists to publish it. The Home Office is suggesting expanding the scope of what information should be covered by the act and extending the punishments for breaking it.

At least 70% of adults in the US have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccination shot, the White House announced on Monday, reaching a target Joe Biden originally said he had hoped to achieve by 4 July.
The administration reported the news in a tweet hailing “Milestone Monday” by Cyrus Shahpar, the government’s Covid-19 data director, who said the seven-day average of people receiving their first dose – 320,000 – was the highest since the Independence Day holiday.

Smoking causes almost twice as many cancer cases among the poor than the well-off, according to new findings that underline the close link between cigarettes and deprivation.
About 11,247 cases of cancer caused by smoking are diagnosed among the poorest 20% of people in England each year, but far fewer – 6,200 – among those in the top 20% income bracket.

                    <span>The romance of her heroine’s ‘rebellious’ red hair is much more of a feature in the Duchess of York’s historical novel than sex
She is a spirited, Titian-haired, freckled beauty, whose curls just won’t quit. While initially submitting to the strictures of high society and the tribulations of the marriage market, she endures a pasting from the press before emerging triumphant, throwing off the weight of expectations to become her true self. And write a children’s book.
The heroine of the Duchess of York’s debut novel for adults, Lady Margaret Montagu Douglas Scott, bears no small resemblance to its author, in both looks and life story. Her Heart for a Compass is out on Tuesday from romance publisher Mills &amp; Boon, but readers hoping for the sexy shenanigans usually found in the publisher’s output will be disappointed. While Margaret indulges in a handful of kisses, and at one point has a man “adjusting his kilt, swearing under his breath”, the pleasures she experiences are all very much above the waistline.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Spending more time indoors and on screens because of Covid restrictions may be linked to an increased rate of short-sightedness in children, researchers say.
The study, which looked at two groups of children aged six to eight in Hong Kong, is the latest to suggest that lockdowns and other restrictions may have taken a toll on eyesight: data from more than 120,000 children of a similar age in China, published earlier this year, suggested a threefold increase in the prevalence of shortsightedness, or myopia, in 2020.

Tim has cerebral palsy and is twitchier than your average nervous suicide bomber. “Actually, you do,” the functionary replies. “You look like you might have been blown up by one of your own badly made devices.”
Is it OK to laugh at such an evidently disablist joke? Perhaps. After all, it was co-written by Tim Renkow, who has cerebral palsy, in a BBC One sitcom about a character called Tim who has cerebral palsy.

Offside decisions to give forwards benefit of the doubt again

The Premier League is to try to end the art of “buying” a penalty, as it announced tougher refereeing criteria for deciding spot-kicks.
When the 2021-22 season begins, referees are to assess three criteria before deciding whether a penalty should be awarded for a foul challenge. Officials must first consider the degree of contact experienced by the attacking player, then the consequence of that contact, before finally taking into account the motivation of the attacker in reacting to the challenge.

The issue had roiled the world of paleoarchaeology ever since the publication of a 2018 paper attributing red ocher pigment found on the stalagmitic dome of Cueva de Ardales to our extinct “cousin” species.

Nine large fires have collectively burned more than 1.8m acres in 12 states, the National Interagency Fire Center reported on Monday morning, including 23 in Montana, some of which have displayed extreme fire behavior.

World Rugby to act over video criticising referee

Rassie Erasmus is poised to continue in his role as South Africa’s director of rugby for the decisive third Test of the British &amp; Irish Lions series despite World Rugby finally announcing disciplinary proceedings against him for misconduct on Monday night.
World Rugby has confirmed that Erasmus, and the South Africa union, will face a disciplinary hearing after an hour-long video emerged last week in which he picks apart Nic Berry’s refereeing performance in the first Test – won 22-17 by the Lions. It is understood, however, that the hearing is highly likely to take place after the deciding Test on Saturday, after the Springboks levelled the series last weekend, leaving Erasmus free to continue his duties including acting as a water carrier.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Boris Johnson has ditched plans for tougher quarantine restrictions for some holidaymakers after days of chaos, as it emerged the chief of the Joint Biosecurity Centre that advises on travel rules has departed the job leaving it “rudderless”. 
After a revolt in the cabinet and a backlash from the travel industry, government sources said the prime minister would not be going ahead with proposals for a new “amber watchlist” to warn travellers which countries were at risk of turning red.
Cabinet sources said the plans were killed off by the Treasury and Department for Transport, as ministers grow in confidence about the drop in daily cases, which fell to 21,052 on Monday.

                    <span>Parker Hannifin could potentially be a decent owner but its commitments are too easy to wriggle out of
The only simple element in US group Parker Hannifin’s £6.3bn bid for Coventry-based defence and aerospace business Meggitt is the takeover premium: an offer at 71% more than last week’s share price counts as fat by any measure. UK investors, once again, have been guilty of seriously undervaluing a FTSE 250 industrial company. Meggitt’s line of work – brakes, sensors, valves, fuel tanks and other components for commercial and military aircraft – may not be glamorous, but will endure beyond the current pandemic upsets.
The tricky part is the “legally binding commitments to HM Government” being championed by Cleveland-based Parker as a way to try to make the deal go down easily with UK politicians. “Legally binding” is a phrase meant to impress. The actual commitments do not. Or, rather, the problem is that they don’t last long.

Hubbard thanks IOC and New Zealand Olympic Committee

History was made on a Tokyo evening of superhuman strength and simmering tension as Laurel Hubbard, a 43‑year‑old weightlifter from New Zealand, became the first openly trans woman athlete to compete at an Olympic Games.
But Hubbard, who was born male but began identifying as a woman in 2013, buckled under pressure of the world’s gaze, as well as the weight of the huge bar she was trying to thrust over her head. Twice the barbell, which had 120kg and then 125kg on it, fell behind her after she had snatched it powerfully from the floor. On another occasion Hubbard got it off the ground and appeared to have made a successive lift, only for two of the three judges to rule she did not have full control.

The Siberian heatwave of 2020 led to new methane emissions from the permafrost, according to research. Emissions of the potent greenhouse gas are currently small, the scientists said, but further research is urgently needed.
Analysis of satellite data indicated that fossil methane gas leaked from rock formations known to be large hydrocarbon reservoirs after the heatwave, which peaked at 6C above normal temperatures. Previous observations of leaks have been from permafrost soil or under shallow seas.

She had known since she read her social services files aged 18 that her birth mother was 13 years old when she was born and her birth father was Carvel Bennett, then 28. The files dating back to 1975 state: “The matter was investigated by police but never brought to court.”

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage


The sight of a needle piercing skin is enough to chill a quarter of adult Britons and trigger up to 4% into fainting. But hope is on the horizon for needle-phobics as researchers are working on a range of non-injectable Covid vaccine formulations, including nasal sprays and tablets.
Almost every vaccine in use today comes with a needle, and the approved Covid-19 vaccines are no exception. Once jabbed, the body’s immune system usually mounts a response, but scientists in the UK and beyond are hoping to harness the immune arsenal of the mucous membranes that line the nose, mouth, lungs and digestive tract, regions typically colonised by respiratory viruses including Covid-19, in part to allay the fears of needle-phobics.

                    <span>The Namibian teenagers were prevented from running the 400m due to naturally occurring raised testosterone levels 
“I don’t understand why people come up with stuff like that. I just don’t get it. It’s very cruel.” Beatrice Masilingi is 18, born and raised in Katima in the Zambezi region of Namibia. In Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium she was as excited as you might expect of any teenager who has barely raced outside her home country, who lists “my grandmother” as her key influence, and who had minutes earlier come cantering in behind Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to make the women’s 200m Olympic final.
If Masilingi was also a little wary, it is because she knows some part of the future is likely to take a difficult turn if she performs with the same level of grace and fire in Tuesday’s final. Masilingi is one of a pair of Namibian teenagers, schoolmates at Grootfontein Agricultural College, who have a serious chance of a medal in the blue-chip sprint event of these Olympic Games.

                    <span>Figures showing one in seven people going hungry in an otherwise rich area should shock ministers to act
Steve Baker, Conservative MP for Wycombe and a well-known Brexiter, said he was not surprised by new research showing that his constituency has the highest levels of food insecurity of anywhere in the country. Around 14% of residents reported going hungry in January and February this year, while a third said getting enough food was a struggle. Mr Baker has the benefit of local knowledge. It is less than a year since another report showed Buckinghamshire to have one of the worst records on social mobility in the UK. But for ministers, these new figures should be a wake-up call. Hunger is disturbing in and of itself. But there are particular reasons to worry about pockets of deep poverty in otherwise wealthy areas.
Buckinghamshire’s highly selective education system is one factor contributing to holding back children from poorer families while perpetuating social segregation. Higher property prices in the south and home counties mean that rents and mortgage costs take bigger chunks out of incomes. But whatever the underlying causes, what these latest figures reveal is a society disfigured not only by severe deprivation but also by widening inequality. Official figures showed the incomes of the poorest fifth of households growing more than the richest fifth in 2019-20, although child poverty rose during the same period. But with the explosion in the use of food banks that accompanied the pandemic, and furlough payments and a Covid-linked universal credit rise due to be withdrawn next month, while property and asset prices have risen, the direction of travel now is towards increased polarisation.

So now we know. Harry Kane really is prepared to do whatever it takes to force a move from Tottenham to Manchester City. The question had nagged away since the final week of last season when Kane and his camp had given the definitive signal that they wanted out and the battle lines were drawn, with Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, digging in and refusing to countenance the sale.
Would Kane be prepared to activate the nuclear option and withdraw his cooperation at Spurs? Surely not, most people had hoped, because to do the dirty like this would be so unbecoming of a homegrown hero, of an England captain.

                    <span>Krystsina Tsimanouskaya has followed in the footsteps of thousands of others deserting Lukashenko’s totalitarian state
Alexander Lukashenko has largely squeezed the life out of the protest movement that threatened his despotic hold on power last summer. As he has done so, a vicious, totalitarian mood has come to dominate all corners of life in Belarus. Earlier this month, there was a sweeping crackdown on NGOs, many of which were previously judged non-political. Independent media organisations have been harassed and shut down. The essential illegitimacy of Mr Lukashenko’s regime was exposed in the aftermath of the stolen elections of 2020. Its survival is now ensured by the brutal crushing of dissent wherever it is found.
Even at the Tokyo Olympics. The decision on Sunday by the Belarusian athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya to seek asylum in Poland followed what was ostensibly a sporting dispute. Ms Tsimanouskaya had publicly criticised the Belarus team’s coaches for failing to conduct the necessary doping tests ahead of the women’s 4x400m race. When she refused to be sent home in disgrace, a leaked tape revealed that a member of the Belarus delegation had told her: “Let this situation go. Otherwise the more that you struggle, it will be like a fly caught in a spider’s web: the more it spins, the more it gets entangled.” If the chilling menace contained in these words seems disproportionate, the tone probably comes from the top: the head of the Belarus National Olympic Committee is Mr Lukashenko’s son Viktor.

                    <span>The site gives more visibility to a certain type of sex work, but like all social media, it invades every aspect of your life
I joked to another sex worker recently that five years ago every journalist asked us, maddeningly and repeatedly, about sex robots. Now, the obsession is OnlyFans.
As a full-service sex worker (“full service” is the industry term for penis-in-vagina penetrative sex), the prominence of OnlyFans in media discourse is frustrating, but I understand it in the same way I understood that last preoccupation. Combine a moral panic (prostitution) with an older generation’s feeling of being left behind by technology (AI, the gig economy) and you have an intoxicating topic. Like sugar-baby website SeekingArrangement before it, OnlyFans is giving more visibility to a certain type of sex work and, thanks to the pandemic, it’s also booming – as newcomers flock to it and in-person sex workers have had to pivot to online.

The trolls, mostly supporters of the controversial French professor Didier Raoult, who co-wrote the paper, “bombarded me on Twitter with all kinds of threats and false accusations”, says Bik, a microbiologist who grew up in the Netherlands and now lives in the United States.

27-year-old inspired by ‘This Girl Can’ campaign

With one extraordinary act of strength and defiance, Emily Campbell ripped a 161kg barbell off the floor, rested it on her shoulders, and began to squat. With another she exploded upwards to thrust the weight - more than two beer kegs worth put together - high above her head.
There was a little wobble of the knees. A steadying smile. Then a beep. And, just like that, Britain had its first ever female Olympic weightlifting medallist - and surely its most powerful, heartwarming and potentially life-changing story of these Games.

                    <span>Paul McGilchrist on why governments should address misinformation clearly and repeatedly, and Des Senior and Patrick Cosgrove on public health and personal freedom 
Emma Brockes makes a good case against using shame and ridicule against the vaccine-hesitant (Should we shame the anti-vaxxers? That can only backfire, 31 July). However, she leaves to the very last sentence the most important consideration: “Why does he think that?” Surely the key to persuading the hesitant is to separate the various categories of concern/attitude and address these issues directly and explicitly – something which neither governments nor the media have attempted to do.
Allowing target groups to remain an amorphous body of “the unvaccinated” helps to sow resentment among those with understandable concerns, through their being lumped together with baseless conspiracists. Inveterate libertarians, meanwhile, gain spurious legitimacy by their association with those claiming genuine (if inaccurate) medical fears. Rarely are any of these groups required to cite reliable facts in defence of their positions, if only because their views are mostly sought by the media through vox-pop reporting.

With reference to Lucy Ellmann’s starkly eloquent letter (We should blame men for the climate crisis, 29 July), I have spent 30 years teaching secondary geography pupils that we don’t use the term “manmade” any more – it’s gender-biased. We should use “anthropogenic” instead. It also makes you sound cleverer.
I’m not sure that I’ve been doing the right thing. The climate emergency is indeed a very gendered fact of 21st-century life. The primary drivers of it have been male-led and male-dominated entities, and the primary victims will be poor, brown and female.

The session on Monday, which was supposed to reach a final decision on whether to accept an appeal from four Palestinian families over eviction orders in the decades-old legal battle, was instead met with a surprise entreaty from the judges for the two sides to accept a “practical solution”.

One down, two to go. Sifan Hassan won the first leg of her Tokyo triple by taking the gold medal in the women’s 5,000m. And, being Hassan, she did it style, with a finishing kick that swept her from past four of the finest long‑distance runners in the world.
Her final time of 14min 36.79sec did not break any records, but that last lap did. No woman had run a quicker final 400m in this event in the Olympics, no woman had, in fact, come close to doing anything like it. It was unprecedented, like so much else Hassan is doing this week. “Many people say I’m crazy,” she said. “Believe me, I think I’m crazy too.”

Too many women do not receive support for anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a miscarriage, according to campaigners, who are calling on the government to completely overhaul medical services to better accommodate those who have experienced pregnancy loss.
The charity Tommy’s said that despite one in four pregnancies ending in miscarriage, it remains poorly understood due to the absence of NHS data collection. Support on the NHS is also restricted to those who have experienced three consecutive miscarriages, despite the fact that many women experience lifelong physical and psychological consequences.

                    <span>Champions win shootout after 2-2 draw
Britain face Netherlands in the last four

Five years ago a forest fire in the hills above Rio de Janeiro spread ash across the pitch before Team GB and Spain met at the same stage of the 2016 Games. The only thing on fire at Oi Hockey Stadium on a sultry Tokyo evening was the goalkeeping of Britain’s Maddie Hinch, whose extraordinary shutout in the shootout propelled the reigning women’s Olympic champions into a semi-final against the Netherlands.
Twice in normal time Britain went ahead, through Hannah Martin and Grace Balsdon, and twice they allowed Spain back into the match. But when the hooter sounded on a 2-2 draw you could almost hear Britain’s head coach, Mark Hager, slapping his hands with glee at the prospect of Hinch deciding this quarter-final. And decide it she did.

Turkey has launched an international appeal for help in taming fires raging across the country that have killed eight people in recent days, as what has been described as one of the worst heatwaves in decades intensifies in south-east Europe.
Following criticism of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, after it emerged that Turkey has no firefighting planes, authorities in Istanbul were promised water-dropping planes from the European Union. The country is battling deadly wildfires along its coastline for a sixth day.

                    <span>The defining car mogul’s ego and criminality are explored in the eye-opening new Netflix docuseries Myth &amp; Mogul: John DeLorean
In Northern Ireland, many still revere the automotive magnate John DeLorean as a local hero for situating his car factory in Belfast at the height of the Troubles, a time of extreme economic deprivation during which the influx of jobs came as a godsend. Others – his family, his personal confidantes, his colleagues, the FBI officials responsible for his eventual arrest – remember the business tycoon as a greedy, flagrantly unethical megalomaniac. The new miniseries Myth &amp; Mogul: John DeLorean triangulates the truth in hiding somewhere between these two characterizations.

A British human rights campaigner and lawyer who was fighting to free Dubai’s Princess Latifa had his mobile phone compromised by Pegasus spyware on 3 and 4 August 2020, according to a forensic analysis carried out by Amnesty International.
David Haigh is the first confirmed British victim of infiltration by Pegasus software, an attack suspected to have been ordered by Dubai, because of his connection with the 35-year-old princess, a daughter of the emirate’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, and the Free Latifa campaign of which he was part.

                    <span>Bestselling author whose fascination with death and violence found expression in the Jack Caffery crime novels
In her mid-20s, while working as a hostess in a Tokyo nightclub, the author Mo Hayder, who has died aged 59, saw the lives of three strangers snuffed out in quick succession. A heart attack in a coffee bar; a workman falling to his death; a snakebite.
These close-up brushes with mortality, shortly after the murder of one friend and the brutal rape of another, sparked a fascination with death and with violence against women that would last a lifetime. Later, while working as a film-maker, Mo produced an animated short in which a cute Claymation couple went to bed together before the woman pulled the man’s head off, ate it and lobbed the skull out of the window. The film won an award, but the local TV station refused to show it, on the grounds that they did not agree with cannibalism.

                    <span>His Carnival of the Animals is widely played and loved, but there’s a great, great deal more to Camille Saint-Saëns. As the Proms marks his centenary, we salute a composer of wit and compression who loathed excesses of emotion
Too facile? Too prolific? Too tasteful? Whatever the objections to Camille Saint-Saëns’s music, the French composer is shamefully neglected and overlooked. This year marks the centenary of his death, and is a good moment to plead the case for someone who, while he may not be quite in the Premier League of composers, is certainly top of the Championship and may well be worthy of promotion. Brentford, if not quite Beethoven.
This summer’s Proms are giving him what might be called a modest push, programming his great Organ Symphony, the much-loved Carnival of the Animals, his first cello concerto, his engagingly sunny late oboe sonata (composed in the year of his death) and the Fantaisie in E Flat Major for organ.

The Covid-19 pandemic was the perfect disaster for our cultural moment, because it made other people being wrong on the internet a matter of life and death.
My use of the past tense here is aspirational. The emergence of the more contagious Delta variant threatens to undo a lot of progress – particularly here in the US, where active cases of coronavirus infection are up 149% from two weeks ago. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that fully vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors in public spaces. The hope that this summer would mark our return to normal is curdling fast, and the enlightened majority – the fact-based, Facebook-sceptical, and fully vaccinated – are looking for someone to blame.

                    <span>Mo Scarpelli cannily captures family dynamics in this documentary about the filming of Jorge Thielen Armand’s La Fortaleza, which starred his hard-drinking dad
Here’s a behind-the-scenes documentary in the tradition of Burden of Dreams­, Les Blank’s making-of film about Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo. This one even has a wild-man actor, Jorge Thielen Hedderich – though he’s not quite a match for Klaus Kinski in the ego stakes. Actually, he’s not even an actor by trade, but he is starring in a movie about his own life directed by his son Jorge Thielen Armand. Or, at least he’s meant to be. His rum-fuelled all-nighters, tantrums and fits of rage are constantly threatening to bring the production crashing down. Though when El Father – as everyone on set calls him – is in a good mood, on full-wattage, his charisma is dazzling.
This documentary is directed by Armand’s partner, Mo Scarpelli. At times it feels frustratingly light on detail about the film she is observing being made: it’s Armand’s second feature, La Fortaleza. What we can glean is that it is the story of how El Father lived in the Amazon in the 1990s, working in illegal gold mining and drinking heavily. Scarpelli is not so interested in whether her father-in-law can be tamed – though she does show the crew sneakily watering down his run. Instead, she zeroes in on the dynamic between father and son – and she’s got an uncanny instinct for knowing which of their reactions to shoot. When El Father breaks his finger, it’s the son’s face she films – wincing as his dad twists his own bone back into place.

EU headquarters said in a statement that the sanctions, which include asset freezes and bans on travel in Europe, “are targeted at individuals and are designed in this way not to harm the Nicaraguan population or the Nicaraguan economy”.

                    <span>My experience with being taught to talk proper is that it doesn’t work – and the lessons themselves are a corrupt concept
If I were a lord with a very low workload, I would try to keep a low profile, in case the world raised its head to wonder what the point of me was. But that’s not Digby Jones’s way. “Enough!” Lord Jones tweeted last Friday. “I can’t stand it any more! Alex Scott spoils a good presentational job on the BBC Olympics Team with her very noticeable inability to pronounce her ‘g’s at the end of each word.” He went on to rail about others he apparently considered too common to be on TV, and to call for all of them to have elocution lessons.
The great irony, for anyone who has forgotten who Jones is, is that he used to be one of Gordon Brown’s “government of all the talents”, yet he absolutely can’t abide any talent that doesn’t sound exactly like himself, especially female talent. So one does wonder whether, over the course of his long public life, this might have caused him to overlook a few.

                    <span>Shirt at Hungarian GP worn in support of LGBTQ+ community
‘I’ll join you next time with the same shirt,’ says Hamilton

Lewis Hamilton has taken aim at Formula One’s ruling body, severely criticising its decision to reprimand Sebastian Vettel for wearing a T-shirt in support of the LGBTQ+ community before the Hungarian Grand Prix.
The four-time world champion Vettel wore a “same love” rainbow T-shirt during the Hungarian national anthem on Sunday. Under FIA rules, drivers are permitted to carry a message that conveys the sport’s We Race As One initiative during the pre-race ceremony. But the clothing must be removed for the national anthem.

                    <span>The government has a moral duty to encourage vaccine uptake, though it must find a way to minimise the backlash
After initially resisting the idea of Covid passports, the government has decided to introduce them in “higher risk” settings in England, such as nightclubs and large crowds, by the end of September in an attempt to coax young people into getting vaccinated. Although the details of this measure are yet to be released, it will probably involve showing proof of vaccination, a negative Covid test or recent recovery from the virus.
The plans for England’s vaccine passports were announced shortly after France introduced its hardline “health pass” approach, which requires people entering restaurants, cinemas, trains and shopping malls to show proof of two vaccinations, a recent negative Covid test or recent recovery from infection. News of France’s health pass sparked mass protests; an estimated 160,000 people took to the streets on 24 July. But it also stimulated vaccine uptake. Nearly 4 million people came forward to get vaccinated after the health pass was announced.

                    <span>James Timpson has employed ex-prisoners since 2008 and says putting trust in people pays off
For James Timpson there is nothing charitable about employing former prisoners. The head of the high street shoe repair and locksmithing firm Timpson – which had a turnover of £209.3m last year – insists he is the “most commercially minded person you will ever meet”, but that employing ex-offenders makes good business sense because “the people we recruit from jails are so bloody good”.
Since 2008, when he opened a shoe repair workshop in HMP Liverpool (no key-cutting skills were practised), his company has employed more than 1,500 ex-prisoners. Just four have returned to jail. Many of those who turned their backs on crime – including some with drug and alcohol issues – have progressed to senior roles in the company, including a current board member.

Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Marcin Przydacz, wrote on Twitter on Monday that the Belarusian sprinter was in direct contact with Polish diplomats and had been granted a humanitarian visa to the country, where she is expected to fly later this week. “Poland will do whatever is necessary to help her to continue her sporting career,” wrote Przydacz.

The war crimes trial in Sweden of a former Iranian official could reveal further damaging details about the role played in the mass execution of prisoners 30 years ago by Iran’s president-elect, Ebrahim Raisi, barely a week after his inauguration.
Hamid Noury, 60, was charged last week with “war crimes and murder” over the killings of more than 100 armed opponents and political prisoners during the final year of the 1980-1988 war between Iran and Iraq.

                    <span>His links to the Tory party chair and its major donors raise disturbing questions and have to be scrutinised
Money talks. Or perhaps more to the point, money gets heard. We know this to be the case in British politics by now, which is why stories that arguably should shock – like the weekend’s allegations that Conservative party chair Ben Elliot runs a secretive club of big Tory donors who are given direct access to the prime minister and chancellor – increasingly elicit little more than shrugs. Well, what do you think people give the government money for, exactly?
But even for the politically jaded, the notion that access to the future king can allegedly be bought feels startling. The telecoms millionaire Mohamed Amersi says he was invited to a private dinner with Prince Charles – who is married to Elliot’s aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall – after several years of paying an annual £15,000 fee to belong to the most exclusive tier of Elliot’s private business venture, the concierge service Quintessentially.

                    <span>Across the Mersey from Liverpool, a group of grassroots promoters is trying to avoid that city’s redevelopment errors as they champion a vibrant cultural renewal
Emblazoned above Christopher Torpey, co-founder of music venue Future Yard, are the words “The future is Birkenhead” in pink capital letters. “It’s tongue in cheek, but we mean what we say,” he says. “This town was once grand and prosperous, and it needn’t be forgotten about and viewed as a pauper to Liverpool. We wanted to have a venue, but also make people think differently about Birkenhead.”
Birkenhead is barely a mile from Liverpool, situated on the opposite bank of the River Mersey. It was once known as the “New York of Europe” thanks to its shipbuilding, but deindustrialisation and waves of austerity have created significant decline. Now, however, a growing cluster of organisations known informally as the Leftbank Collective hope to provide the infrastructure for a resurgent creative community. Recent commissions such as an immersive audio experience by US avant-garde musician Kali Malone in a 153-year-old hydraulic tower, and an interactive walking tour – featuring new pieces by Wirral musicians including Half Man Half Biscuit and OMD, inspired by local landmarks – are celebrating its former grandeur.

Twenty-nine people died and hundreds were wounded when the Real IRA detonated a car bomb in the County Tyrone market town on 15 August 1998, four months after the Good Friday agreement supposedly drew a line under Northern Ireland’s conflict.

The nail-biting matches had lit a fire of sporting patriotism – not least because both were against China, Taiwan’s goliath neighbour, which claims Taiwan as a province it must retake.
The doubles win by Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin was Taiwan’s second gold medal, after Kuo Hsing-Chun won in weightlifting, and added to its biggest medal haul in Olympic history. Taiwan sits 18th in the table. China is first. Nevertheless, social media was awash with celebrations.

As pandemic restrictions are lifted in England, many of us will be returning to offices and meeting up with friends for the first time in more than a year – and some of us may not look the same way we did in pre-Covid times. We may have gained weight, or lost muscle, or simply look more tired than before. Perhaps we harboured vague goals of returning to the world with sculpted abs and perky posteriors, but life in a pandemic puts paid to the best-laid plans. So how do you feel OK about your body as the country begins to open up? The experts weigh in.

There are very few things that I dedicate as much time to as watching Love Island during the summer. For two months it’s on six nights a week, for at least an hour each time. I began watching it a few years ago, just because other people were doing it and I’m easily influenced, but now, in the third year of my Love Island lifetime, I found myself wanting to examine this behaviour a bit more closely.
What is it that I enjoy so much about this programme? And why am I enjoying it so much this season in particular?

                    <span>Vinca, 37, and Lee, 40, were housemates in Manchester before they fell in love. They live in north Wales with their son
In early 2008, Vinca was a self-confessed party girl, living the high life in Manchester. She worked for a recruitment firm during the day and went clubbing at night. “I lived with my best friend at the time, Flo. He and I were always having people over, but we needed a third flatmate,” she says.
After seeing their advert online, Lee applied. “I was studying in Staffordshire and it was cheaper to move to Manchester than live in student halls,” he says. Lee went to look at their flat – and go through their tough “interview process”. “I immediately picked up on his Stoke accent, as it’s where I’m from,” Vinca says. The pair hit it off after discovering they had mutual friends.

                    <span>This strawberry custard tart is perhaps best known by Italians as one of the many tiny cakes to enjoy with coffee, but there’s nothing to stop you enjoying them on a larger scale …
The bar in Linari must be 12m long, at least, and it’s shaped like an “L” or an allen key. The shorter section is opposite the espresso machine, and a good place to stand, or lean, with one eye on both doors and the cash desk, and the other on the silver machine with its crown of warm cups. I’m not sure which movement I prefer: the bash to get the used-up coffee grounds out of the filter basket, or the twist to put the newly filled portafilter back in place. Certainly watching a barista make an espresso is not something I ever get bored with; the opposite, in fact: the dark grounds deposited into the basket and pressed firm, the twist, then the hiss of pressure that forces the right measure of water through the compressed grounds and the dark stream into a small cup.
Sometimes sugar, sometimes not. If I do, I stir 15 times clockwise, because, years ago, I overheard a conversation between two people I liked the look of and I copied them. The other thing about stirring is that it is mildly hypnotic: a seven-second meditation with a cup in the company of others, but all alone. The bar has a glass top, so if you haven’t paid for a pastry, you might feel regret looking down on the well-lit, quite well-laminated cornetti, raisin whirls and armband-sized, ring doughnut-like ciambelle.

American star withdrew from team final due to mental health

Simone Biles will compete again at the Tokyo Olympics. The six-time Olympic medallist will contest the balance beam final on Tuesday, the final day of artistic gymnastics in Tokyo.
USA Gymnastics announced on Monday that both she and her teammate, all-around champion Sunisa Lee, will take their places in the final. Its tweet read: “We are so excited to confirm that you will see two US athletes in the balance beam final tomorrow - Suni Lee AND Simone Biles!! Can’t wait to watch you both!”

                    <span>Once neglected in favour of supposedly healthier products or mass-produced substitutes, butter is back, and better than ever, thanks to chefs who are adding bone marrow, chocolate and churning their own
It sounded like another fad – like the cereal cafe in east London, or the crisp bar in Soho. “This Colorado bistro is the world’s first butter bar,” ran the headline of an article announcing the opening of Bella La Crema, a US restaurant serving “flights” of handmade butters flavoured with spices or herbs. The comparison to beer and wine tasting boards jarred at first – but butter in its truest form is perhaps closer to wine than it is to crisps or cereal: there’s terroir in the pastures; technique in the churning; magic in the addition of bacteria cultures and (optional) flavours. And Bella La Crema, which has been delivering its beloved bourbon butter, rosemary and sage butter, house butter and chocolate butter around the US throughout their lockdowns, and has since started looking for its second site, might conceivably be the next step in a movement that has been quietly taking place in some farms, dairies and restaurants for years.
“It was in the Fat Duck that I first noticed it, around the turn of the millennium,” says Jay Rayner, the Observer’s restaurant critic. “There was a handmade goat’s milk butter with a pronounced cheesy edge to it. Then, in 2006, Stephen Harris at The Sportsman in Kent showed how he churned butter from local milk and flavoured it with salt he made by boiling the seawater from the nearby shore.” Thereafter it became “a thing”. No longer content with packets bought wholesale, restaurants started buying cream, culturing it and churning it in-house. Chefs pushed the boundaries of flavoured butter, enveloping herbs, spices, vegetables and meat into its golden folds. Those who didn’t make butter on site started to source it direct from small-scale dairies – and, as demand grew, so did the number of butter-makers.

                    <span>A deputy news production editor at the Guardian speaks to colleagues about how cutting and correcting copy has evolved over decades
The internet may have revolutionised the media in the 21 years since I joined the Guardian, but my role as a subeditor has stayed essentially the same. We check facts, write headlines and cut stories to the right length, with a final spellcheck before moving it to its next stage.
But until late last century, subediting looked completely different. Chris Dodd started work on the features desk, then based in Manchester, in 1965, after an “interview” in a pub (he didn’t know whether to drink or abstain, or buy a round), while Barry Johnson and Jay Sivell joined the London office in Farringdon Road in 1986. Shifts then started at various points in the afternoon, and subs (as they are called) enjoyed a leisurely start. “People used to take in chess sets and books, or do the crossword. You could sit for hours with nothing,” says Johnson, who retired in December.

This work is supported and produced by the Magnum Foundation, with a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation

Having grown up in the troubled Indian region of Kashmir, photographer Showkat Nanda knew what it was to be “a child of conflict”, the name often used to describe the generations of Kashmir’s youth since the 1980s. This picturesque Himalayan region has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for decades, with several wars fought over the territory, and since the 1990s it has been home to a heavy Indian military presence and a long-running separatist insurgency with an allegiance to Pakistan.
Yet while it is the militants, soldiers and politicians who dominate the headlines around Kashmir’s troubles, Nanda’s gaze had often turned to the more invisible victims, in whom he saw himself: Kashmir’s children.

                    <span>Keen to unlock your inner creativity? De-stress and unwind? Or merely improve the quality of the gifts you make for friends? Step right this way
Have you ever forgotten to buy a loved one a birthday present? Here’s a tip. Get a card, then draw a picture inside of you giving them the gift you intend to buy them later. It’s a charming IOU, impossible to resent. I’m not the best at hands or faces, so the result often resembles demons in hell, spearing each other, which isn’t what everyone wants to see on their birthday. Particularly when you later forget to buy the present. To rescue an otherwise flawless system, I’ve come to an alfresco painting class to hone my dark art.
MasterPeace Studios promises to unlock anyone’s inner creativity. To prove it, those in charge tell me to choose a personal photograph I’d like to paint. I select a photo of my friend Amish Tom, at a recent pizza party we threw. In the picture, he’s rolling dough with his elegant fingers, sunlight striking his face. He’s extremely photogenic, which I don’t mind. But is he painting-genic? Why is there no word for this?

                    <span>Stint of working from home rewrites rules for office dressing, with retailers seeing demand for hybrid wardrobe
With a return to the office now a real possibility, workers in the UK are thinking about something they haven’t for a while: what to wear. This comes after 16 months at home with only a laptop for company – and only a semblance of presentability required for video calls. The conventions of office attire are being reassessed, particularly by men who often wore suits for work. So are they ditching the jogging bottoms and dusting off their suits or are elasticated waists here to stay?
With hybrid working – spending part of a working week in the office, part from home – now seen as a possible post-pandemic possible, Sam Kershaw, the buying director of menswear site Mr Porter, suggests there will be hybrid wardrobe to match. “Our customers are not ready to disregard the ‘at home’ shift of investing in comfortable, versatile pieces for their wardrobe,” he says. “Particularly as many will remain working from home in some capacity.”

As a compulsive diary writer – she has kept one since she was eight – Jessie Cave knows that, unless it gets written down, life gets forgotten. She is glad, then, that she wrote her debut novel, Sunset, because the way she felt at the time “would have just gone, and then you’re in a different place and you don’t remember”. This book, says Cave, was “absolutely the only thing I could write during that period”.
In March 2019, her younger brother Ben died in an accident aged 27. Her book was written in the aftermath, that manic feeling that sometimes comes with grief pushing her on. It went straight to No 1 on the Times’ bestseller list after being published in June. “I don’t know if I would have that energy now,” she says.

A car shaped like a giant hotdog has just crashed through the glass storefront of a menswear shop. As a crowd assembles to figure out what happened, a man dressed in a hotdog costume appears and begins a loud and concerted effort to identify the person who caused the damage. Bystanders point out to him that he is clearly the culprit, a charge he forcefully denies in ever more aggrieved and preposterous ways.
It is a scene from the US sketch comedy programme I Think You Should Leave. If you’ve been on social media this year, you may have seen the much-memed picture of Hotdog Guy saying, “We’re all trying to find the guy who did this.”

The impact of plastic on wildlife is a growing area of research, and studies have revealed harrowing cases of marine animals sustaining injuries or dying after ingesting such material or becoming entangled in it.

                    <span>The city has become one of the few places to have been dropped from the UN body’s global list of sites. What went wrong?
Two centuries ago, more than 40% of global trade passed through Liverpool’s port. The bricks and mortar that remain are steeped in this maritime history, and that’s what made Unesco put the city on its heritage list in 2004, alongside illustrious others such as the Taj Mahal, Venice and the Great Wall of China. In recent years, though, developments in the old heart of Liverpool have raised the UN body’s eyebrows. Warnings were issued about the property deals being signed off in the area, and now Liverpool has been removed from the heritage list. What’s more, Unesco has issued a warning that other UK sites will join Liverpool if the government doesn’t take better care of the country’s heritage. 
Nosheen Iqbal talks to The Guardian’s North of England correspondent, Josh Halliday, about what went so wrong for Liverpool, and whether a city has to choose between preserving its past and building for its future prosperity.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has issued a formal apology for historic racist policing of Pacific people and offered scholarships to Pacific students.
Hundreds of people packed Auckland town hall on Sunday to hear the apology for the “dawn raids” of the 1970s during which authorities hunted for visa overstayers.

‘Everything got blurry on the podium,’ he said post-race

Lewis Hamilton believes he may still have not fully recovered from contracting Covid-19 after he experienced fatigue and dizziness at the Hungarian Grand Prix. The British driver finished third in a monumental effort to come back from last place at the Hungaroring – a position later raised to second when Sebastian Vettel was disqualified on a technicality – but admitted he fears he may be suffering from long Covid.
After his immense recovery drive Hamilton missed the start of the post-race press conferences as he was being attended to by his Mercedes team doctor for fatigue. He said later he did not feel he had fully recovered from the effects of the virus he contracted in December last year. “I have been fighting all year with my health after what happened at the end of last year and it is still a battle,” he said. “I had really big dizziness and everything got a bit blurry on the podium.”

                    <span>This stunt-filled documentary sees TV producer Jamie O’Leary and comic Jamie MacDonald consider how creatives with low vision and blindness both survive and thrive
Blind Ambition (BBC Two) takes the tried and trusted format of putting two grumpy men together and sending them off on an exploratory adventure. The twist here is that Jamie O’Leary, a TV director, is partially sighted, and Jamie MacDonald, a standup comedian, is blind. O’Leary, who directed the series I’m Spazticus, explains that his passion projects cast disabilities in a different light. The idea here is to meet blind or partially sighted creatives, to see how their vision changes, well, their vision.
Blind Ambition is part travelogue, part documentary, part art project, and it is a bit of a shambles, at times, but a charming one. O’Leary has myopia, and at the beginning the producers send him off to an appointment at the eye doctor: “I always get a ‘wow’.” On cue, his optician greets him with one, before asking MacDonald what he would say to O’Leary, if he were to lose his sight completely. Should he prepare himself for it, or act as if it will never happen? O’Leary says, frankly, that he is in denial and can’t even let himself go there.

The Conservatives must publish the names of all ministers who secretly met an elite group of party donors, Labour has said.
The party is facing questions over the conduct of the party’s co-chair, Ben Elliot, the nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall, after the Financial Times reported that he had created a club for some of the party’s most generous donors, some of whom gave £250,000 a year or more. The members are reported to have regular access to the prime minister and Rishi Sunak.

Kyle Sinckler is facing the prospect of a lengthy ban after he was cited for an alleged bite on South Africa’s Franco Mostert during the British &amp; Irish Lions’ second Test defeat by the Springboks but several other controversial incidents have been overlooked.
Sinckler was the only player cited from an ill-tempered second Test – won 27-9 by South Africa – over an incident in the 64th minute. He will face a disciplinary panel on Tuesday and if found guilty he will miss the decider on Saturday and face a minimum suspension of 12 weeks. The maximum is four years.

Steve Baker, a leading Brexiter and MP for Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, called on ministers not to ignore the cost of living crisis faced by people “in real trouble” in constituencies like his who had been “tipped over the edge” financially by the pandemic.

Democrats who control the House of Representatives cannot blame Republicans for a looming crisis over evictions, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, after a federal moratorium lapsed on Saturday night.

Myanmar’s military leader has declared himself prime minister and said he will lead the country under the nation’s state of emergency until elections are held in two years’ time – vastly extending the timeline given when the military deposed Aung San Suu Kyi six months ago.
“We must create conditions to hold a free and fair multiparty general election,” Gen Min Aung Hlaing said on Sunday during a recorded televised address. “We have to make preparations. I pledge to hold the multiparty general election without fail.”

                    <span>The increasingly draconian approach to irregular migration betrays the spirit of the 1951 refugee convention
Seventy years ago, the 1951 UN refugee convention established the rights of refugees to seek sanctuary, and the obligations of states to protect them. Increasingly, it seems that much of Europe is choosing to commemorate the anniversary by ripping up some of the convention’s core principles.
So far this year, close to 1,000 migrants have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean, more than four times the death toll for the same period in 2020. Many will have been economic migrants. Others will have been fleeing persecution. Increasingly, Europe does not care. All were “irregular”. And all must be discouraged and deterred through a strategy of cruelty.

                    <span>Investment in flood defences is overdue. But progress on climate resilience requires confronting vested interests too  
Nothing about the climate crisis is easy. The challenge of adapting to global heating and the climate disruption it causes is particularly hard. It forces us to reckon with harms that cannot be undone and is sometimes viewed as jeopardising progress on reducing emissions, by drawing away resources and political will. After all, if we can adapt to climate chaos, why bother trying to prevent it?
Since this argument is a staple of climate deniers, such fears are well founded. But unless we are prepared to stand by as people’s lives are destroyed by extreme weather, adaptation is required. For the relief and protection that they will bring to large numbers of people living in flood-prone areas, last week’s announcements of record funding for new defences in England, along with new guidance and insurance rules, must therefore be welcomed. Disastrous floods in Belgium, Germany and China, and the horror of the North American “heat dome”, have alarmed scientists and focused minds.

Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the fastest man on the planet, the face of the 2020 Games, your new Olympic champion, wait, wait, I’ve got it here somewhere, on one of these pieces of paper, yes: Marcell Jacobs. If you don’t know – and plenty didn’t – you do now. Jacobs, a 26-year-old former long jumper, born in Texas, raised in Italy, won a wildly unpredictable and wide-open men’s 100m in 9.80sec. Which is pretty damn quick. And would have won almost every other Olympic final, including, yes, the last one at Rio in 2016, when Usain Bolt finished in 9.81sec.
And there he is, unavoidably. I say almost every Olympic final because there are two exceptions, Bolt’s twice-in-a-lifetime runs in Beijing in 2008 and London 2012. If you were watching on Sunday, you’ll have seen that World Athletics have started blacking out the stadium at the beginning of the sprint finals. It’s one of the new tricks they’re using to make the sport more appealing now that they’re having to do without their biggest star. Maybe they’re hoping that in the pitch blackness, no one will notice the shadow Bolt still casts over the sport.

Overhead, however, the dark silhouettes of birds are accompanied by helicopters, warplanes and missiles, and the garden’s red and yellow flowers look like flames.

The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the government believed the drone attack on the oil tanker off the coast of Oman was “deliberate, targeted, and a clear violation of international law by Iran”.

A low-cost airline service with a brand new business class cabin, flying London to New York? As Frank Sinatra might have said: if you can make it there, in the teeth of a global pandemic when the US bars British citizens and advises its own to stay put … well, you can make it anywhere.
On 11 August, nonetheless, JetBlue will launch transatlantic flights that could rattle one of aviation’s normally most lucrative markets. The airline, one of the biggest in America but without the global presence of the “big four” US carriers, will launch its first services to the UK with the promise of driving down fares, particularly for the business traveller.

Prolonged solitary confinement is an extreme form of treatment, prohibited in all circumstances under international law. Your article (Fifty-two prisoners in close supervision units ‘that may amount to torture’, 26 July) exposed this practice in highly restrictive prisons.
Prolonged solitary confinement has in fact become routine in all prisons during the pandemic, with many individuals being confined alone or with a cellmate for 22 to 24 hours each day since March 2020.

The editorial says: “Tunisia’s presidential power grab is a test for Joe Biden’s democracy and human rights agenda.” Throughout history, US global aggression has always been justified by the mantra of “bringing democracy” to the rest of the world. From the occupation of the Philippines to Cuba, Nicaragua, Vietnam and the Middle East, US intervention has been nothing more than establishing and maintaining its economic and military hegemony.

Last August, it was “eat out to help out”, launched by a beaming and maskless chancellor in Wagamama on London’s South Bank, carrying plates of noodles to nonplussed customers. This year, it’s “fly out to help out”.
With just a few weeks left of the school summer holidays, the airline and tourism industries are facing another bleak summer. As the threat of possible new restrictions hangs over holidays, and the costs of testing prove prohibitive for many families, many have decided to take their vacation in the UK, even though travel restrictions will ease for fully vaccinated travellers from 16 August.

                    <span>Edinburgh epidemiologist concerned about spread of ‘escape mutants’ that may defy vaccines
Scientists have said that the lifting of restrictions for fully vaccinated arrivals to the UK from the EU and US, which begins from Monday, is not without risk.
From 4am on Monday, those who have been fully vaccinated in the US and Europe will be treated the same as British residents, meaning arrivals from amber list countries will not have to quarantine when entering England, or test on day eight after arrival.

There has been a serious and systemic failure to tackle antisemitism across the five biggest social media platforms, resulting in a “safe space for racists”, according to a new report.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok failed to act on 84% of posts spreading anti-Jewish hatred and propaganda reported via the platforms’ official complaints system.

Should the American hammer thrower Gwen Berry finish in the top three later this week, it seems likely the question will arise.

Pope: ‘It’s sad but I think it’s a reminder to everyone’

Ollie Pope says the withdrawal of Ben Stokes for the Test series against India is a reminder of how mentally tough the demands of playing international sport are during a pandemic.
Stokes, England’s Test vice-captain and heartbeat of the team, has taken an indefinite break from cricket to protect his mental wellbeing and rest the left-index finger he fractured playing in the Indian Premier League in April. The all-rounder’s absence is a blow to England’s chances in the five-Test series against India that starts at Trent Bridge on Wednesday.

                    <span>Ange Postecoglou is not gregarious by nature but looks quietly troubled by what continues to transpire in front of him
When once presented with a question about his philosophy, Martin O’Neill told the story of the new manager who lost his first three fixtures 3-2, 4-3 and 5-4. By the time a fourth high-scoring defeat in a row arrived, boardroom purring over style had given way to edginess and questions on whether victory was likely at any point in the future. O’Neill’s Celtic side would never win awards for artistic merit but the Irishman’s generally successful tenure meant supporters had little cause to bother. As Tiger Woods puts it, winning takes care of everything.
Celtic do not make a habit of losing their opening league fixture; their defeat against Hearts on Saturday was their first at such a juncture since 1997. One must go back further decades to discover the last time Celtic did not win any of their first three competitive matches in a season. That a Champions League qualifying-stage exit to Midtjylland does not even register as a mild embarrassment says everything about Celtic’s dysfunctional state. This week, a club which prides itself on status far beyond Scotland will begin their quest to scrape towards the Europa League by seeing off Jablonec. It is far from a given.

Israel’s supreme court is due to make a decision on whether to evict Palestinian families from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, in a final hearing in the controversial case that helped spark communal violence inside Israel and a new war with Hamas earlier this year.
A verdict in the deeply contentious case, which could lead to the neighbourhood’s current residents being forcibly displaced to make way for Jewish settlers in a decades-old dispute, is expected on Monday morning.

The NHS is facing pressure to redistribute tens of thousands of vaccine doses nearing expiry as demand from younger adults drops.
An internal email seen by the Guardian warned of 170,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine at risk of expiry within the next fortnight, as doctors across England have raised alarm at the unpredictability of vaccine take-up among young people meaning more doses will go to waste.

This shelved collection from 2010 is not peak Prince – and he knew it
Every few months someone eagerly forwards me that clip of Prince’s majestic While My Guitar Gently Weeps solo at the 2004 Hall of Fame. It’s ages since anyone sent me an unreleased Prince song with similar enthusiasm. Recently discovered in Prince’s vault, this album won’t change that.
Recorded in a week by a scratch band, its songs went unreleased and unplayed on his 2010 Welcome 2 America tour. It’s not immediately obvious why. The intriguing title track takes some spiky if unfocused shots at America’s frailties, and Prince deliberates on race, politics and religion elsewhere, but there’s no controversy – or anything like 1981’s classic Controversy. Perhaps he realised that, after writing “Slave” on his face to protest about his multimillion-dollar record deal, his thoughts on that topic might not be well received.

                    <span>In 2012 British swimmers were happy to come fifth or sixth but we are now third in the medal table with eight medals
James Guy leant back against the wall, too tired to think, too tired to talk. Guy swam seven races in the past five days, the last of them, the butterfly leg of the men’s 4x100m medley relay, just an hour earlier. It had been one of the hardest, and most intense races of his life, and they had lost it to the USA. Now the media wanted to ask him and his teammates all those familiar questions about how it felt, and whether he was disappointed or not. Guy’s usually happy to prattle but this time he closed his eyes, let his teammates do it for him. Until someone asked a question that got his attention.
It was about how the culture of British swimming has changed in recent years. Guy is 25, which makes him one of the senior figures on this young team, and he wanted to tell a story which he thought summed it all up. “Eight years ago I made the senior team for the first time,” Guy said, “and I remember at my first world championships, every day we’d have a team meeting, and in it we’d all clap for whoever had made a final that day.” He laughs at it now. “And here we are, we’ve got second, and we’re upset with that, and that shows you the way things have moved on.”

If you were wondering when the widely predicted post-Brexit dystopia might move beyond the imaginings of TV scriptwriters and into the real world, we suddenly seem to be a lot of the way there. Supermarket shelves are either understocked or completely empty. The populist loudmouths who now try to make the political weather have been taking aim in the past week at the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and its supposedly “woke” lifesavers.
Meanwhile, the Johnson government’s descent into whip-crack law enforcement continues apace. Last week’s announcement of a new “crime reduction plan” was centred around the permanent relaxation of restrictions on “suspicionless” (in other words, often arbitrary) stop and search, which had a clear performative aspect: ministers blithely batting away the fact that black people are a staggering 18 times more likely to be searched than white people under these specific powers, presumably to demonstrate a wretched kind of toughness. Johnson also launched plans for chain gangs dressed in hi-vis jackets.

The footballer Terry Cooper, who has died aged 77, was England’s ebullient left-back in the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico and Leeds United’s classy, exciting defender when they were at their brutal best in the late 1960s and early 70s.
Although England were knocked out in the quarter-finals in Mexico, Cooper did not want for winners’ medals. With Leeds he won the First Division championship in 1968-69, the League Cup in 1968, and the Fairs Cup in Europe – twice – in 1968 and 1971. An offence-minded defender, he was particularly effective in partnership with the Leeds left-winger Eddie Gray, whom he would join in attacking forays.

On 9 August 2011, Begum had been surrounded by her family; her husband, Ghazanfar, her three sons, Abdul Quddoos, Shazad Ali and Abdul Musavir, and her daughter, Sumera Ali. It was Ramadan and she remembers in detail the food that she had cooked that night – keema kebabs, masala haandi with warm chappattis and sweet fruits for pudding. Just before they sat down for the family meal her son, Shazad, had affectionately fed her a date to break her fast.

Pressures in the criminal justice system meant it failed to distinguish between repeat offenders and people “caught up” in the 2011 English riots, a former chief prosecutor has said.
More than 2,000 people were convicted of riot-related offences with harsh sentences doled out. The average custodial sentence for riot-related cases was more than double compared with similar offences in 2010 in magistrates courts, while in crown courts it rose by three-quarters, according to Ministry of Justice analysis.

Whenever we go walking in the countryside with our three-year-old, dogs approach him and frighten him. He has never come to harm, but there is always a concern. It happens within seconds. Typically, the owners either airily tell us their dog is harmless, or they more aggressively say: “What are you afraid of?” Does anyone else have this problem? How can you prevent dogs jumping at children? How should I respond when it happens? Tracey Lewis, Diss, Suffolk

The Taliban escalated its nationwide offensive in Afghanistan on Sunday, renewing assaults on three major cities and rocketing a major airport in the south amid warnings that the conflict was rapidly worsening.
As Afghan government forces struggled with a resurgent Taliban after the withdrawal of US-led foreign forces, hundreds of commandos were deployed to the economically important western city of Herat, while authorities in the southern city of Lashkar Gah called for more troops to rein in the assaults amid fierce fighting.

                    <span>The 34-year-old has given free haircuts on the street since 2015, and has put the stories of some of those he has helped in a book
One evening in spring 2015, Joshua Coombes did something that changed his life for ever. He was walking to a friend’s house after finishing work at a hairdressing salon when he stopped to talk to a homeless man he’d seen many times in the same spot. In the past, he had bought the man something to eat or given him some spare change, but this time a thought occurred to Coombes: how about I offer him a haircut? He had his gear in his backpack and he cut the man’s hair right there on the street. As he worked, the pair of them fell into the chatty intimacies of barber and client, opening up to each other. The next time they met, the man introduced Coombes to a couple of his friends and he got his clippers and scissors out for them too.
Soon, he says, he was out on the streets of London as often as he could be, enjoying the chance to change often desperate lives in a small, surprising way. “A haircut is not the first thing on your list of things you’ve thought you were going to do that day, if you’re sat there on the street,” he told me when we met for a coffee near his home in Peckham, south London, last week. “You’re thinking of where you’re getting your next meal or where you might be staying that night. So me walking up and offering a haircut was unexpected and most of the time people were really receptive. And if they’re not, that’s totally fine too. I’ll just have a chat with someone and see where that goes.”

With introspective but operatic rap, Dave paints pictures on an album that’s part confessional, part social critique  
In 2019, Dave’s Mercury prize- and Brit award-winning debut, Psychodrama, became a classic overnight; now it has a rival for introspection, operatic quality and wordplay. Tender piano arrangements, unadulterated storytelling and sermon-like verses flood this topical album that is part confessional poetry, part social commentary. “I’m a young black belligerent. Child of an immigrant. Lifestyle frivolous,” he raps on opener We’re All Alone. The seeming juxtaposition of these realities means that while he can be bragging about Rolexes with Stormzy on Clash, he’ll peel away at his own materialism on Survivor’s Guilt with the admission that, behind the glitz and glamour, he is “cryin’ in the driver’s seat”. It’s not all about the self. “My Jamaicans, the entire party, you can’t see?” he proclaims, honouring the island’s enormous contribution to British culture on the violin-rich Three Rivers, a track about migration that discusses the Windrush scandal.
The highlight is Heart Attack, a glorious nine-minute stream of consciousness where his feelings spill out in abundance, on everything from knife crime to politicians doing cocaine. “Round here, the main way to provide for your kin is in a flick blade, little push-bike and a sim.” When Dave raps, he paints murals. James Blake production, Daniel Kaluuya cameos and Wizkid vocals are just surplus.

                    <span>Rural areas suffer from an undersupply of affordable housing. Cracking down on second homes is one part of the solution
Devon, where I grew up and have lived on and off my whole life, always had a surplus of affordable places to live. Even a couple of years ago many private rentals stood empty for months. This year, when my husband and I needed to move back from Lundy, an island off the north Devon coast, things were very different.
There was such a dearth of long-term rentals that I found myself jumping on anything listed. We competed with 50 others for an overpriced place that had flooded the previous winter, and had our application rejected for a bungalow with a scoreboard above the bed. For most properties, we didn’t even get to the application process. Many listed in the morning would be fully booked for viewings by lunchtime. Soon, we expanded our search from north Devon to the entire county, and then to Cornwall, Somerset and Dorset. Wherever we looked, I heard the same story: “Fully booked for viewings.”

Coronavirus – latest updates

See all our coronavirus coverage

The Conservative party has a problem with young people. In the last general election fewer than one in six of the under-25s voted for Boris Johnson, and it is unlikely that the pandemic has improved matters.
While it’s the case that elderly people have been most at risk of contracting Covid-19 and dying from it, the economic cost has been highest for teenagers and those in their 20s. It is young people, whose jobs are disproportionately concentrated in the retailing and hospitality sectors, that have been most likely to be furloughed or had their roles made redundant.

                    <span>The introverted narcissist is harder to spot and may be more sinister
We pretty much know what narcissism is by now. The description “narcissist” is a buzzword, a darling of amateur analysts. Those needy, charismatic attention-grabbers stride across the world’s stage, using and confusing those who fall for their charms. They have the perfect platform in a culture obsessed with both celebrity and social media. They rule countries, they mesmerise, they manipulate and wreak havoc.
But beyond the more showy and recognisable type lurks a lesser known and essentially more dangerous sub-species. Where your standard overt narcissist is a wolf in wolf’s clothing, the covert narcissist is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. “The more silent and subtle variation is often more confusing and sinister,” says Dr Sarah Davies, psychologist and author of Never Again – Moving on from Narcissistic Abuse and Other Toxic Relationships.

Ana Raquel Nunes is a senior research fellow at Warwick medical school who studies the links between global heating and human health. She has leant her expertise to the World Health Organization, the intergovernmental panel on climate change, the International Science Council and more. Her interest in extreme weather was prompted by a family holiday in the Algarve during the European heatwave of 2003, in which tens of thousands of people died. This year has seen record temperatures, forest fires, melting glaciers and crumbling infrastructure.
We know that heatwaves are becoming more frequent, more intense and more prolonged both in terms of temperature and humidity. What can we expect?
The heatwave of 2003 was really, really bad. I was young and struggled to cope with the heat. I felt very hot, thirsty and tired. My mother and grandma struggled even more. People were getting ill, being hospitalised. The vulnerable were dying.

Chinese Taipei’s Lee takes silver, Japan’s Kazuma bronze

Max Whitlock never watches his rivals’ performances – at least not until he has finished himself. Until then he focuses on his own actions and all the things that are within his power to control. It appears to have been a good tactic for him over the years but on the day of his third Olympic pommel horse final it was rendered obsolete.
Before the final Whitlock was drawn as the first man up, an experience he had never felt before in a big event. He was already feeling the abject stress of trying to retain a title the world was scrapping for and being thrust up as the opening routine only augmented the stress. But since he emerged on the world stage nine years ago Whitlock has consistently shown that his success is driven by rare mental fortitude. He did so again, outclassing the field to defend his Olympic gold medal on the pommel horse with a supreme routine that scored 15.583.

                    <span>Academics predict that northern dialects will soon fade away. That’s nobbut a load of soft southern blether
Ah, the stalwarts of summer! Cowes, Goodwood, the Proms and, these days, gloomy academic prognostications about the future of northern accents. Last summer, Manchester University claimed that the speech differences of the big northern cities were fading, merging into a generalised uber-northern that, implausibly, might include Alan Bennett, Ant and Dec and Atomic Kitten. This year, Cambridge and Portsmouth “eggheads” (compulsory designation) tell us, yet more gloomily, that northern accents could start dying out within 45 years, drowned by the rising tide of “estuary” English and the dominance of southern dialects which apparently are “easier to pick up” for children.
Really? Easier to pick up where? Where are these weird kids? The mean streets of Cheltenham perhaps but not Chorlton. From my experience, Mancs are getting more Manc, Geordies more Geordie and Scousers more adenoidal with every passing football and festival season, brandishing their glottal stops and short a’s as if they were cudgels. But there is more.

The challenge follows concern from lawyers and charities that some victims of trafficking could be wrongly removed from the UK under a speedy processing system for migrants in detention known as “detained asylum casework”.

                    <span>The peaks around Church Stretton put Victorian tourists in mind of the Swiss Alps – and that tranquillity still exerts a strong pull
The first time I saw the Shropshire Hills it was through a misty car window during a frigid winter drive from Birmingham to Snowdonia. Scrunching up my jumper sleeve and wiping away the steam for a better look, I saw a hazy collection of dull green lumps rising starkly from their pastoral surroundings beneath a blanket of grey cloud. Though my interest had been piqued, this wasn’t the ideal way to view a landscape once described by the Victorians as Little Switzerland.

                    <span>Fans across the world enjoy complementing their Olympic viewing with some research. We meet the man who wants everyone’s story told
In 1992, 11-year-old Guy Fraser spent his summer vacation fiddling with a radio. He was searching, sometimes in vain, for an English-language broadcast of the Olympics in Barcelona. He was trapped in France. Oblivious to the Olympics – and her son’s devotion to them – Fraser’s mother had booked a two-week break that coincided almost perfectly with the Games. Fraser was heartbroken, but he made the best of it. He found French broadcasts he could mostly understand as he sussed out how his favourite athletes were faring in Spain.
Nearly three decades later, the Englishman is just as enthusiastic about the Games, especially after more than a year of Covid-19 lockdowns. So in the leadup to Tokyo, he began to do some research. Fraser is an equal‑opportunity viewer – “Once you properly understand the rules and tactics, any sport is inherently fascinating,” he told the Guardian in an email – and he wanted to be as informed as he could be. So he scrolled his phone from his home in Bath perusing rosters, trying to learn a thing or two about the people who’d earned spots on teams across the world.

                    <span>Anxiety and depression fell among those who were finally allowed down the aisle
Most people getting married think it’ll make them happy. At least I hope they do – it’s not worth it for the ring or the £5-a-week embarrassment of the marriage allowance.
Luckily, even if not everyone getting hitched reaches cloud nine, we have proof that changing who is allowed to get married does boost wellbeing. That’s the conclusion of research on the 2001 Dutch decision to legalise same-sex marriage. By linking data about people’s sexuality with a health survey, researchers are able to show that before 2001 there was a big mental health gap by sexuality: people in same-sex relationships had markedly higher levels of depression and anxiety than people in non-same-sex relationships.

                    <span>A gently spiced dinner and summer’s most fun dessert
It is the fleeting nature of ice-cream that appeals to me – the idea of catching something at its brief moment of perfection. In the case of ice-cream, that’s somewhere along the road from rock hard to milky puddle. They may bring with them a sense of peace and lazy summer days, but ices also come with a sense of urgency. I was the kid that would always choose a wafer over a cornet, fascinated by the way the fragile biscuits stuck to your lips, but also enjoying the race to finish before the block of vanilla ice-cream dripped down my shirt.
The ice-cream sandwich has come a long way since I was in short trousers. Its flavourless wafers have now been ditched in favour of crisp cookies that flatter the flavour of the ice. I made a lemon version this week – a simple no-churn job with yoghurt, cream and lemon curd – and held it between thin, crisp biscuits speckled with grated orange zest. Matching wafer to ice-cream can be fun: chocolate ice-cream and ginger cookies; almond wafers to raspberry sorbet; pistachio biscuits holding saffron ice-cream. You can make almond tuiles, ginger snaps or the one I especially like, a softer shortbread-style cookie that doesn’t go too hard in the freezer.

Last week, Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of the Guardian, was announced as the new editor at Prospect, the centrist magazine that was set up in 1995 by the author and social analyst David Goodhart.

                    <span>Increasing awareness of the price of toxic masculinity has led many parents to wonder how best to prepare the young men of the future. One father consults the experts
My little son has a gang he roots for. All boys, dudes everywhere – they’re his gang. I figured this out, recently, when we sat down to watch the Grand National. He’d picked a horse in the family sweepstake and his choice was out in front for most of the race. When it fell back, out of contention, my son paled a bit. Possibly he’d already spent the sweepstake winnings in his head (on stickers, sweets, toy balls) but he took the disappointment quite well, I thought, for a four-year-old. The race was won in the end by a female jockey. It was the only time a woman had ever finished first in a Grand National, the commentators shouted. And all at once my son did cry, real fat gushers, instant snot moustache, the works. Now this was too much, if a girl had gone and beaten all the boys.
Where does it come from, I wondered, this kneejerk allegiance that distances little boys from little girls and makes an us-v-them of gender distinctions, right from the get-go? Where does it lead, as those boys become men? These are questions I’ve been wondering about a lot as my son gets older. He’s a friendly, curious kid who adores his older sister but his sense of himself, just now, seems to come across most clearly when he emphasises the contrasts between them. Along with millions of other little boys he will be coming of age during a richly complicated time for young men, and I want to help him get this right.

                    <span>The PM’s talk of ‘fluorescent-jacketed chain gangs’ had a similar effect to that of a misfiring new Oxford Street attraction
Earlier this week a pile of mud was dumped at the west end of Oxford Street. Then some squares of grass were stuck on the mud. Then people were charged £8 to go up it. Visitor Emma Wright tweeted that going up the mud was “the worst thing I have ever done in London”. But I believe it was Dr Johnson who wrote: “A woman who thinks going up some mud is the worst thing she has ever done in London has not visited the ladies’ toilets in Crystal Palace park. And neither have I.”
The mud’s purpose is to promote Oxford Street, where 17% of shops have closed since March 2020. But in the long term, the best way to save shops is to force Amazon to pay proper tax, so it cannot undercut them. Making people pay £8 to go up mud will not do this. Though British Amazon goods are delivered from British Amazon warehouses to British Amazon customers on British roads by British drivers, the sales of those goods are processed in lightly regulated Luxembourg. Can it be a coincidence that as the net tightens on Amazon, its founder, Jeff Bezos, is lobbying Nasa to put Amazon in charge of outer space?

                    <span>Secretive gangs are hacking the computers of governments, firms, even hospitals, and demanding huge sums. But if we pay these ransoms, are we  creating a ticking time bomb?
They have the sort of names that only teenage boys or aspiring Bond villains would dream up (REvil, Grief, Wizard Spider, Ragnar), they base themselves in countries that do not cooperate with international law enforcement and they don’t care whether they attack a hospital or a multinational corporation. Ransomware gangs are suddenly everywhere, seemingly unstoppable – and very successful.
In June, meat producer JBS, which supplies over a fifth of all the beef in the US, paid a £7.8m ransom to regain access to its computer systems. The same month, the US’s largest national fuel pipeline, Colonial Pipeline, paid £3.1m to ransomware hackers after they locked the company’s systems, causing days of fuel shortages and paralysing the east coast. “It was the hardest decision I’ve made in my 39 years in the energy industry,” said a deflated-looking Colonial CEO Joseph Blount in an evidence session before Congress. In July, hackers attacked software firm Kaseya, demanding £50m. As a result, hundreds of supermarkets had to close in Sweden, because their cash registers didn’t work.

The idea of a “lost Atlantis” under the North Sea connecting Britain by land to continental Europe had been imagined by HG Wells in the late 19th century, with evidence of human inhabitation of the forgotten world following in 1931 when the trawler Colinda dredged up a lump of peat containing a spear point.
But it is only now, after a decade of pioneering research and the extraordinary finds of an army of amateur archaeologists scouring the Dutch coastline for artefacts and fossils, that a major exhibition is able to offer a window into Doggerland, a vast expanse of territory submerged following a tsunami 8,000 years ago, cutting the British Isles off from modern Belgium, the Netherlands and southern Scandinavia.

Eimear McBride, 44, is the bestselling author of three novels: A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, which won the Women’s prize for fiction and the Goldsmith’s prize, The Lesser Bohemians and Strange Hotel. Her first work of nonfiction, Something Out of Place: Women and Disgust, is the result of an invitation by the Wellcome Collection to explore its museum and library, housed on Euston Road in London. She lives in east London with her family.
How did your new book come about?
Wellcome was a place where I was a temp, back in the old days before I was a full-time writer. I worked in the library: I was the stack monkey. So when I was asked about doing this, I was very open to the idea; I’ve always been fond of Wellcome. I didn’t go to university, so I’d never had the experience of spending a lot of time just reading.

                    <span>The 1980s child abuse scandal reminds us that now, as then, being ‘on the side of the angels’ has to be backed with action
A council’s most important job is not emptying the bins or filling in potholes, the stuff most people see day to day. It has by far and away one of the most important jobs anyone could have: to be a parent. Local authorities, between them, have parental responsibility for more than 100,000 children in care in the UK. These are some of society’s most vulnerable children, removed from their parents’ care because they have experienced or are at risk of abuse and neglect. Anybody disinclined to take that responsibility seriously should come nowhere near elected office or senior management at a local council.
How, then, did Lambeth council in south London get itself into a position where members and senior managers, at best, looked the other way while children in its care were subject to the most depraved sexual, physical and emotional abuse and, at worst, were complicit? The report of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) into Lambeth, published last week, sets out the horrific scale and nature of what went on over several decades from the 1960s. More than 705 former residents of Lambeth children’s homes have come forward with complaints of sexual abuse; the inquiry says the true scale will be significantly higher.

Greenberg, now 74 and living in Tel Aviv, was on a quest to reclaim property lost during the Holocaust. Her father was head of a prominent, wealthy Jewish family in Lodz that owned industrial buildings, residential homes and holiday properties.

Miranda Sawyer picks 20 indie podcast gems

The British Podcast Awards were different this year. Held in a south London park, they had a boutique festival feel, with wristbands and tokens for drinks, an open-sided tent for the actual awards, and people lounging on blankets in front of the stage. There were also sponsor areas – those small, picket-fenced areas where invitees could drink and mix with brand bigwigs. Awards are expensive to stage, and to give any sort of a professional sheen, money is needed. In 2017, the BPA sponsors included Radioplayer and Whistledown, an independent audio creator. In 2021, the BPA was “powered by Amazon Music”. Spotify, Stitcher, Audible, Acast, Global, BBC Sounds, Podfollow and Sony Music also dipped into their sponsorship pockets. Clearly, podcasting has gone up in the world.
Over the past 18 months, podcasting has hit the corporate big time. Apple, long the most recognisable name in podcasting, its iTunes chart being the public measure of any show’s success, is attempting, clumsily, to move from being a neutral platform that hosts shows into one that makes money from podcasting (by, for example, charging creators for highlighted spots).

                    <span>Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft all reported record-breaking profits amid a pandemic bonanza but recent Biden administration moves suggest US tech’s easy ride is over
Big tech provided the world with some startling numbers this week. In the last three months Amazon’s sales have averaged over $1.2bn a day. It took the company less than four seconds to earn the $52,000 the average American makes in a year. Apple is now sitting on nearly $200bn in cash, more than this year’s expected sales of Covid 19 vaccines.
The coronavirus shook the world economy to its core but for the US tech giants it has proven a bonanza of historic proportions.

                    <span>The naturalist Stephen Moss finally achieved his aim to see all 61 of the UK’s  butterfly species. But those that thrive on the margins could vanish as temperatures rise
It was a long walk up the steep, rocky path, on an unexpectedly warm day – but well worth the effort. Along the banks of a stream, on the slopes of Ben Lawers in the Scottish Highlands, I finally came across my quarry.
A small, unassuming, chocolate-brown butterfly, with a row of black spots edged with orange on its wings: the mountain ringlet. For me, this marked a natural history milestone: the last of Britain’s 61 regularly occurring butterflies which I had yet to see.

There, in the background, wearing drop pearl earrings, is 13-year-old Lily Allen dressed up as a little lady-in-waiting. Cinema audiences watching Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth when the film of that name came out in 1998 might have been concentrating on the queen’s courtly dancing in the middle of the frame, but yes, it really was Allen playing a mini royal favourite in director Shekhar Kapur’s lavish production.
Now, more than two decades later, the 36-year-old singer-songwriter is taking centre stage as an actress in the West End, appearing in a spooky new play, 2:22 – A Ghost Story, which opens this week.

                    <span>Bertien van Manen snaps five young Russians enjoying a brief escape from the seismic shift in their country’s fortunes
In the years immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Dutch photographer Bertien van Manen travelled through some of the outlying states, living with families and documenting ordinary lives. One of the books she produced about those travels was called Let’s Sit Down Before We Go, a reference to the Russian custom of taking a quiet moment before a long journey to reflect on the place you were leaving and imagine where you were going next.
Van Manen’s pictures captured a whole empire in that kind of limbo. Sometimes, as here, temporary refuge might be found in a vodka bottle. The young men on this camping trip, to the shores of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, have hung their empties on a line, a trophy each for the five of them, and one for luck. The two boys standing appear to be enjoying the sunlit freedoms of the holiday; the two staring into Van Manen’s camera under the piratical flag might fancy themselves in Lord of the Flies.

Coronavirus – latest updates
UK can expect thousands of Covid deaths every year, warn scientists

John Edmunds has been at the centre of the unravelling of the Covid-19 pandemic since cases first appeared in January 2020. A member of Sage, the government’s scientific advisory group, and a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, he has consistently warned ministers about the threats posed by the disease.
These risks have often been clear in their nature. But today, 18 months after Covid-19 first appeared, he believes the nation stands at a point of maximum uncertainty about the future of the pandemic.

                    <span>This old country pub has raised its game. Some will groan, but for me it’s a winner
The Bradley Hare, Church Street, Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire BA12 7HW (01985 801018). Starters £6.50-£10, mains £13.50-£23, desserts £7.50, wines from £20
If you wanted a single plate of food to symbolise the current state of the gussied-up country pub, you could do far worse than study my main course at what is now the Bradley Hare in the village of Maiden Bradley, a few miles outside Warminster in Wiltshire. It is steak and chips. Except, of course, it isn’t steak and chips; or at least not just steak and chips. The meat is impeccable, in keeping with the noisy commitment here to quality ingredients. They don’t just have a butcher. They also have a game dealer. They say they are against waste and very much for community involvement, so they have a barter arrangement with the local allotment society, allowing them to commission certain vegetables and “botanicals” for the bar. The Bradley Hare has the kind of bar that needs botanicals. I suspect it didn’t when it was the somewhat less titivated Somerset Arms.

With figures inside the cabinet concerned about the plans already in place to enforce vaccine passports in some settings, the government’s focus has turned to using incentives to drive up vaccination rates over the summer to head off another Covid wave as offices, schools and universities reopen.

A volunteer marshal has died after being hit by a car which spun off the track during a race at the Brands Hatch circuit.
An air ambulance landed on the circuit after police and paramedics were sent to the track near Dartford, Kent, at 3pm on Saturday.

A major increase in attacks on police has been recorded during the pandemic, according to official figures revealing that there were more than 100 assaults on officers in England and Wales every day.
With senior police figures warning that officers have faced deliberate spitting and coughing since the start of the crisis, it has emerged that there were 36,969 assaults on police in the year that followed the outbreak in March 2020. It represented a 20% rise on the previous year

Labour has accused the Conservatives of squandering the London 2012 Olympic legacy by slashing grassroots sport funding by nearly half since coming to power.
The party said that during the final year when Labour was in government, it spent more than £1bn on sport and recreation facilities during the financial year ending in 2010.

When Laura Muir was a teenager, she was so fast that local farmers employed her to catch newborn lambs before they got lost. Now, though, she will have to chase two lions to win gold at these Tokyo Olympics. The first, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, is going for an unprecedented treble of 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m at the same Games. The second, Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon, recently ran the fourth‑quickest 1500m time in history.
However, the popular Scot is convinced she has a shot at the podium, which would be her first in a world outdoor event, and is in the “greatest shape” of her life. The bookies agree and make her third favourite for the 1500m when it begins on Monday.

Gatland refuses to blame refereeing decisions after loss

Warren Gatland has warned that Rassie Erasmus’s social media outbursts could set a dangerous precedent and has urged World Rugby to act, following the British &amp; Irish Lions’ second Test defeat by South Africa. Gatland’s side were comprehensively beaten by the Springboks after Erasmus’s rants at perceived injustices by officials last week provoked the desired response from the world champions.
The Lions led 9-6 after a first half in which South Africa’s Cheslin Kolbe was fortunate to escape a red card after taking out Conor Murray in the air. Robbie Henshaw was also denied a try just before the interval in a marginal decision by the referee, Ben O’Keeffe of New Zealand, but the Springboks turned the screw thereafter.

The former Leeds defender Terry Cooper has died at the age of 77. The left-back, who won 20 caps for England, played 351 times for the club between 1964 and 1975, scoring 11 times.
One of those goals was the winning goal in the 1968 League Cup final against Arsenal and he played a key part in the club’s First Division title the following season.

For three decades, Phil Mather has harvested olives from feral trees around South Australia. Mather, a landscape gardener, began hand-picking the fruit and pressing it into oil in his early 20s.
It’s a seasonal pastime that has turned into a business in the past eight years. “This year I have produced over 1,500 litres, which entails nearly nine tonnes of wild fruit and [olives from] relinquished groves,” he says. Now 51, he sells most of his oil locally, at the Willunga Farmers Market and through retailers in Adelaide.

Seventeen. That is the number of gold medals the Australian Olympic team won at the 2004 Games in Athens. It represents the most successful ever Olympics for Australia, one gold medal ahead of Sydney 2000 and four ahead of Melbourne 1956.
Of course, there are many ways to measure Olympic success. The Americans are fond of ordering their medal tally by total medals won, which sometimes boosts the United States above other nations. After the 2008 Games, when China won the most gold medals and the USA won the more medals overall, then-International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge took a diplomatic stance. “I believe each country will highlight what suits it best,” he said. “We take no position on that.” (Although the medal count on the IOC website ranks by gold).

                    <span>The former Real Madrid defender does not demand attention but his skill set is a perfect fit for the Premier League
In the 10 years since Raphaël Varane joined Real Madrid, he hasn’t done much. Apart from win the Copa del Rey, three league titles and four European Cups. There’s the World Cup, too; 360 games at the biggest club of all, and 79 more for France. But that’s about it. In his first clásico, a Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou, he cleared one chance one off the line, stopped Lionel Messi taking another and scored a superb header; in the second leg he scored again, taking Madrid to the final. He was 19, and it was all downhill from there.
Varane is 28 now, has racked up 18 winners’ medals, and has gone. Which tends to be about the time people realise what they’ve got. Varane’s departure has been a story followed closely for months – the first hint he might leave came more than a year ago – but its conclusion has passed relatively quietly. Perhaps the most striking part of his move to Manchester United is that there has been little eulogy or lament, no tearful farewells nor fierce criticism that it came to this.

Millions of voters who Labour must win back if it is to regain power have little idea what the party stands for or why it would improve their lives, according to a stark internal analysis by Keir Starmer’s new strategist.

Former pollster Deborah Mattinson, who has been appointed director of strategy in a shake-up of the leader’s inner circle, briefed Starmer, shadow ministers and MPs on sobering internal polling and findings from focus groups days before the summer recess. Her presentation highlighted the huge challenge Labour faces if it is to win back trust in time for a probable 2023 election – and avoid a fifth consecutive loss to the Tories.

Nigel Farage may not be the best-loved emergency service, but as demonstrated by his recent work for GB News, the struggling, consciously patriotic news channel, he is always available, willing to take on jobs most broadcasters wouldn’t touch, and delivers reliably transformative effects.
Two weeks ago, GB News was considered merely unpleasant, unsuccessful and unwatchably amateurish. Now, with its new Farage programme on every day, it looks well placed to be far more intensely and widely disliked, including by those who haven’t seen the channel’s line in impartial headlines – “Cocky Forecasters”, “Freedom Farce” – and now never will. Though, after watching the channel last week, I can’t really think of this as – on their part – a loss.

Tokyo blues. Dina Asher-Smith did pretty well, all things considered, to keep it together for the opening minute and seven seconds of a startlingly raw post-race debrief in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium, and fresh from elimination in the semi-final of the 100 metres.
The past five weeks have, it turns out, been an extraordinary story of cloak and dagger rehab for the fastest British woman ever to take to the track. On 26 June Asher-Smith felt a pop in her hamstring en route to winning the Team GB trials in Manchester in a time of 10.97sec. As she told the gathered journalists in that Tokyo hanger, “You were all looking at the clock, you didn’t know what the story was.”

Roger Federer never quite managed to achieve it, nor did Martina Hingis, Stan Wawrinka, Patty Schnyder or many of the notable Swiss players before her. But late on Saturday night in Tokyo, Belinda Bencic stepped into the light and clinched the greatest achievement of her career by becoming an Olympic champion, defeating the Czech Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 2-6, 6-3.
In a tense, volatile match filled with sharp momentum swings, Bencic was considerably more disciplined than her opponent and her consistency was rewarded on the biggest points at the close as she won the final three games to take the match. Despite how composed she appeared, Bencic said she spent much of it on the edge.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Britain faces the prospect of thousands of annual Covid deaths for years to come, scientists have warned.
They say waves of cases are likely to sweep the country every winter as Covid-19 joins other seasonal viruses, including influenza, in taking its toll of elderly and infirm people. Every year, as cold weather forces people indoors, virus transmission will increase, case numbers will rise, and some of these will result in deaths.

His books are saturated with despair. Over and over again, his emotionally traumatised characters are caught – inescapably – in plots that doom them to a life of anguish. Often, they kill themselves.
Now, the psychological wounds and suicidal thoughts that blighted WG Sebald’s own life and secretly inspired him to begin writing fiction are to be laid bare for the first time in a forthcoming biography.

Like a knackered old cruise singer who has finally decided that this cover of Make You Feel My Love will be, must be, their last, The X Factor has slunk offstage for good.
The talent show has not been on air since 2018 but, last week, ITV confirmed that, after 17 years, it was a no from the channel and there are no plans to bring it back. Reports suggest that its creator and overlord, Simon Cowell, pulled the plug to prevent it becoming “a joke”, which makes me think Cowell has not been on the internet in the past decade.

At ground zero of Lebanon’s apocalypse a stench of dead rats seeps from hulking piles of rotting grain. Broken silos teeter above, their sides ripped apart by the catastrophic blast that also broke the soul of Beirut; the contents that should have fed a nation still lie spilt over the gaping ruins of its main port.
A year ago this week, one of the planet’s gravest industrial accidents caused one of its biggest ever explosions, shattering a city that was already at a tipping point. The mushroom cloud of chemicals that soared above the Lebanese capital on 4 August 2020 and the seismic force of the shock wave that ravaged its homes and businesses were carried around the world in high-definition horror. Even amid the chaos of a country that had allowed this to happen to its people, this was surely a moment of reckoning.

If one thing has become obvious in the summer heat and the inevitable baring of flesh, it’s the degree to which body art is now the norm. At the pool, the park, or the pub beer garden, you’ll find an enormous variety of designs inked on the skin representing the breadth of human creativity.
About 20% of adults in the UK now have at least one tattoo, and that proportion is likely to grow. Cynics might argue that the increased uptake is a superficial fad, based purely on the aesthetic appeal of tattoos. In this view, they might be the result of a momentary impulse to follow a passing trend followed by years of regret, rather than something that holds deep meaning.

As well as being named a New York Times notable book of the year, it won an LA Times award and is currently being developed for cinema by producer Erik Feig. Cosby’s new book, Razorblade Tears (published, like its predecessor, by Headline), is a revenge thriller that confronts homophobia across various communities in the deep south. Film rights have been bought by Paramount Players.

“I hope they inspire people to visit the parks and connect with nature, but, heck, it’d be awesome if the book inspired folks to pick up a squeegee and start printing too,” he says.

                    <span>Poplar’s Labour mayor, who went on to lead his party, was jailed in his fight for social justice 100 years ago
Kings and queens are immortalised in statues, prime ministers are remembered with official portraits, but an opposition leader best known for his pacifism before the second world war has to make do with a fading mural, knocked up on a crumbling wall beside an east London housing estate in the middle of the night by a local rugby player.
The mural of George Lansbury, who led the Labour party from 1932 to 1935 before resigning over his opposition to rearmament, may not be the world’s finest piece of street art. But it depicts a lesser known and arguably more important moment of his political career – one that only those with a keen interest in Labour party history will know much about.

                    <span>Report after report is reaching the same conclusion: exporters, including many in the red wall, will be suffering for a long time
Brexit is beginning to take its toll. Trade with the EU is suffering and foreign investment is heading south. Neither trend is temporary and both harm the government’s stated aim of “levelling up” regions that until now have depended on overseas trade to create well-paid jobs.
It’s not clear if the red wall has noticed. Or anyone among the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit. So far, all the in-depth polling shows there is little movement on the vexed question of EU membership.

There are no plans to bring in vaccine passports for university students in England, the Department for Education has said, as a row continues over their use.
In interviews this week ministers – including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab – had not ruled out using them, with students set to return to campuses in September.

William Buick likely to ride for Godolphin at Longchamp

Seven days on from an abortive trip to Ascot, Wonderful Tonight extended her winning streak to four with a comfortable success in the Group Two Lillie Langtry Stakes. David Menuisier’s filly may yet have two more runs before heading to the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, as her connections try to decide on a jockey for the big race in Paris on 3 October.
William Buick, who is getting married on Sunday, has been in exceptional form all week and rode a confident race on Wonderful Tonight, the 8-11 favourite. The four-year-old, racing over 14 furlongs for the first time in four starts, took a strong hold in the early stages but still had more than enough left to stride on over two furlongs out, before holding Tribal Craft and Albaflora with ease.

                    <span>The spiritual leader has mused that he may return as a woman. But his succession has turned into a political battle
A couple of years ago, during a meeting of Tibetan leaders in Dharamshala in India, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, was asked about his reincarnation. Addressing the room of monks, religious teachers and Tibetan politicians, the Dalai Lama asked them to look into his eyes. “Do you think it’s time now?” he asked.
It was a meeting that would end with the Tibetan leaders agreeing that the issue of reincarnation was one that would be decided only by the Dalai Lama himself. But China, which annexed Tibet in 1951 and has retained tight control over the region ever since, has other ideas. It insists that the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with China, and have even enshrined this right into Chinese law.

It’s 7am on a Monday and my heart is racing. Normally my Mondays are reserved for tedious activities, but this morning I’m chasing a high. I’m not in a nightclub greeting sunrise with a tequila, sadly, but in an east London café. The source of my palpitations? I’m steeling myself to strike up a conversation with an unsuspecting man a few tables away.
Given that I’m a journalist who interviews people for a living, you might think I’m being overly dramatic. But talking to strangers can be terrifying. The unpredictability of how they will respond to your overture, and the possibility of rejection, is paralysing. Perhaps the worst fear of all: might they find me annoying?

                    <span>Now the reach of the Israeli firm’s smartphone-hacking software has been revealed, the US and Apple may take action

See all the Guardian’s stories as part of the Pegasus project investigation

What’s the most problematic tech company in the world? Facebook? Google? Palantir? Nope. It’s a small, privately held Israeli company called NSO that most people have never heard of. On its website, it describes itself as “a world leader in precision cyberintelligence solutions”. Its software, sold only to “licensed government intelligence and law-enforcement agencies”, naturally, helps them to “lawfully address the most dangerous issues in today’s world. NSO’s technology has helped prevent terrorism, break up criminal operations, find missing people and assist search and rescue teams.”
So what is this magical stuff? It’s called Pegasus and it is ultra-sophisticated spyware that covertly penetrates and compromises smartphones. It’s particularly good with Apple phones, which is significant because these devices are generally more secure than Android ones. This is positively infuriating to Apple, which views protecting its users’ privacy as one of its USPs.

                    <span>As leaders around the world grapple with cryptocurrencies, what happened when the African country tried to ban them?
When the Nigerian government suddenly banned access to foreign exchange for textile import companies in March 2019, Moses Awa* felt stuck. His business – importing woven shoes from Guangzhou, China, to sell in the northern city of Kano and his home state of Abia, further south – had been suffering along with the country’s economy. The ban threatened to tip it over the edge. “It was a serious crisis: I had to act fast,” Awa says.
He turned to his younger brother, Osy, who had begun trading bitcoins. “He was just accumulating, accumulating crypto, saying that at some point years down the line it could be a great investment. When the forex ban happened, he showed me how much I needed it, too. I could pay my suppliers in bitcoins if they accepted – and they did.”

Lewis Hamilton executed with sublime precision to take pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix but the Mercedes driver received a blunt and boorish reception by some fans for his efforts. Red Bull accused him of gamesmanship and he was booed as he climbed from his car at the Hungaroring after a qualifying session in Budapest that will have done little to ease the tension between the two teams. The title is on a knife edge and tempers, too, are being tested.

He played the lead in Frank and a romantic interest in Brooklyn, though he is probably best known as General Hux in the latest Star Wars trilogy.

                    <span>The rescue service has a long and glorious history of saving the lives of people, wherever they come from
A couple of weeks ago, I was at Lizard Point in Cornwall. The old lifeboat station below Britain’s most southerly cliffs has long since been replaced but the rusting structure remains, a stubborn legacy of heroism past. It was from here, in February 1907, that the biggest sea rescue in the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) was launched when the liner SS Suevic was thrown on to the jagged reef offshore in high winds and dense fog. For 16 hours, the lifeboat crews rowed out and rescued all 456 passengers (including 71 infants). The ethnicity or country of origin of those rescued was not recorded, as it has not been recorded for the 146,000 other lives saved during the RNLI’s history.
There has been much talk in recent years of the relevance of some of our monuments to the past. The lifeboat stations that circle our coastline, crewed by volunteers and funded by charity, are living reminders of the humanitarian impulse that remains the best of us. Nigel Farage’s attempts to undermine that spirit last week, by characterising boats saving drowning refugees as a “taxi service for migrants”, went against everything that the Lizard lifeboat and all the other crews risk their lives for. The fact that donations to the RNLI are up 3,000% in the days since is a welcome indication that the spirit that sends those crews out is as appreciated now as it ever was.

                    <span>A pandemic renovation turned this small terrace into a serene retreat – with party potential
Future architectural historians will earmark the pandemic as a decisive time for British housing. Incarcerated within our four walls, it is when the deficiencies of our interiors became glaringly obvious. A lack of privacy or a tranquil corner to work in; an absence of outside space; dispiriting views; woeful wifi. All these things need to be addressed.
Rebecca Layoo and Roman Meyer’s east London home might serve as a template for change. Set in a tranquil grid of tree-lined terraced streets, their brick and stucco-fronted two-bedroom house has been unpicked and reconfigured for post-pandemic living. There’s a study with treetop views and a once dismal cellar has become a utility room. At the back, the long bright kitchen-dining extension merges with the garden.

A murder investigation has been launched after a dying man was discovered surrounded by a group of males in High Wycombe.
Thames Valley police said its officers were on patrol in the town, in Buckinghamshire, when they saw the man, in his 50s, on the ground in the early hours of Saturday.

Boarding school was pretty grim: dormitories, horrible food, structure. Mum disappeared and then suddenly I didn’t see Dad for huge chunks of the year either. I don’t like regret, it’s a useless emotion, but I wish Mum – a nurse who didn’t smoke – hadn’t died of cancer. Away from home, I did a lot of crying and feeling sorry for myself.
I broke into Pinewood Studios at 15, after discovering films existed. I kept seeing the same place listed in the credits, and searched for it on a map. From Bexhill-on-Sea I travelled by train, tube and bus, only to be told to fuck off by security. I found an entrance and brazenly marched in. This didn’t jump start my career as planned, but it was magical.

Should we disenfranchise the childfree? If you’re wondering what kind of stupid question that is, the answer is: it’s the sort of stupid question that Fox News hosts and Republicans deem worthy of serious discussion. Last week the intellectuals at Fox News took some time out from vilifying immigrants and inventing things to get outraged about in order to debate whether the “childless left” deserve a vote. After some careful consideration they decided that while it probably wasn’t “feasible” to ban childfree people from participating in society, the idea did have merit.

                    <span>The social media phenomenon on honouring his Somali heritage, balancing fame and faith, and spending lockdown with his YouTube Beta Squad
“It was the scariest day of my life,” says Amin Mohamed, AKA Chunkz, of the day in 2016 that he told his parents he was dropping out of university to focus on his YouTube channel. “I remember waking up for a lecture during the first few weeks of university, and I genuinely stared at my ceiling for 45 minutes, near tears, just thinking: I can’t do this. I had this pressure [weighing on me] that my parents wouldn’t accept me leaving.”
Chunkz is a first generation British Somali (his parents moved here from Somaliland in the late 80s). For me, also a first generation British Somali, he is, as a genuine celebrity from our community, a unique figure – and a local hero. Following in the steps of his three sisters, who had all graduated from university, he was studying financial maths at London Metropolitan University. For Somali kids, it’s not uncommon to have your parents push you toward a “reliable” career. So he stuttered his way through that moment, telling his parents about dropping out of university. His dad avoided eye contact and his mother became really upset. “As I was talking to them, I was doing damage control,” he says.

Team GB were one minute and stoppage time away from an Olympic semi-final when the Australian midfielder Emily van Egmond scooped the ball from just inside the GB half to the chest of an unmarked Sam Kerr. With all the time in the world, Kerr twisted and crashed home an equaliser. The soul-sapping effect of the last-gasp strike proved fatal.
It would be easy to point fingers. Why was the Women’s Super League’s most potent finisher alone in the middle of the area with seconds left on the clock? Britain’s defence consisted of Kerr’s Chelsea teammate Millie Bright and several players who have attempted – with admittedly mixed results – to contain her guile domestically.

                    <span>(Nifflas Games; Triple Topping; PC, Mac)
As a single-celled animal, your options are limited – and yet this gem of a game is a masterclass in minimalism
Ynglet is not the first video game to cast its player as an amoeba. Without an expansive repertoire of abilities to call upon, the single cell organism protagonist presents a certain kind of game designer with an alluring challenge. When all a player can do is swim, dash and float about a bit, puzzle and challenge must be carefully constructed from first principles. If it works, as in Ynglet, a meditative, chic jewel of a short game from Swedish designer Nicklas Nygren, there is a purity and clarity of design that none of the medium’s sprawling action epics, with their mythically capable warriors, can rival.
Contrary to appearance, this is not a game viewed top-down, as if through a microscope’s viewfinder. Rather, it’s a sideways-on biosphere, in the Super Mario style: your frondy amoeba is subject to gravity’s inexhaustible attempts to tug your character off the bottom of the screen. To navigate each of the game’s eight worlds, you must hurl yourself between bubbles of water, which catch and suspend you until you dash toward the next point of safety while seeking the exit. Ynglet is about managing momentum, about estimating arcs and trajectories while desperately trying, in common with all life forms, to resist the inexorable pull of oblivion.

I’m always amazed by the sheer variety of fruits that exist in nature, each with their own personality. This lime sorbet is robust with the sour taste of citric acid, but also has that delightful, refreshing perfume that is most welcome on a hot summer day. Makrut lime leaves are used in Thai cooking to build citrus flavours in curries, and infusing a few leaves into the base of the sorbet adds a hint of their special aroma. Taking a step away from the citrus is a roast grape salad with hints of fresh herbs, lemon and creamy sheep’s cheese; slices of warm, toasted sourdough with butter are a great way to finish up.

The rose-pink thatched cottage in the seaside village of Walberswick, Suffolk – home to designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi – isn’t as ancient, or incongruous, as you might think. Built in the 1940s “to look old”, its colour isn’t some fashionable flight of fancy; rather, it’s quite common in this part of the world, Thornton says. “Pink houses are traditional in Suffolk. People would mix natural pigments such as elderberry or ox blood with limewash.” The pair, who run the British fashion label Preen, used Nancy’s Blushes from Farrow &amp; Ball to similar effect.

• Read an exclusive extract from Chaise Longue: ‘After a certain point of drinking, Dad’s behaviour became a lottery’
Baxter Dury strolls up to the pub, casually dressed and apologetic. The indie musician, known for his stylish suits, is wearing a white vest and unbuttoned denim shirt. His face is even whiter than the vest. Food poisoning. He ate oysters the other day, and has never been so sick. He orders a pineapple juice and soda water, sheepishly. “That’s going to be the headline, isn’t it?” The 2010 biopic about his father was named Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll – after one of Ian Dury’s most celebrated songs, and a fair summary of his life.
But we’re not here to talk about Dad, says Baxter, a successful musician in his own right. It’s 21 years since his father died, and 19 since Baxter recorded his debut album, the fabulously titled Len Parrot’s Memorial Lift. Don’t get me wrong, he says, he loved the old man, but he’s got Ian Dury fatigue. He’s tired of the comparisons – their music, voice, looks and lifestyle.

The sparrow and dunnock are often confused. “Oh, look, there’s a sparrow,” someone may say. But it is not; it’s a unique dunnock, unknown, unheard. Its song is that of the robin but higher and sweeter. Once again, no one knows the true singer. Dunnocks fly low, popping out from the trunks of bushes. They have intricate tunnels and pathways through tall forget-me-nots and grasses. Timidly, they dance under the drooping leaves of bluebells.
Today, however, we venture out beyond the garden. We are looking for some slightly more exotic birds, the nightingale and the skylark. We walk with the breeze cooling our cheeks, till we come to the water meadow where the skylarks nest. A winding freshwater river skips through it, with blossoming hawthorn and wild damson bending over its little coves where the nightingales nest. A nightingale sings suddenly while two skylarks hover above their “nests” twittering. Their songs are high and sweet – like that of the dunnock, but the dunnock will always be there in my garden through the cold of winter and the heat of summer.
Laura, 12

                    <span>A new deal for working people has never been more urgent. To start with, we’ll ensure all employees have the same rights
For many UK workers, insecurity is not a new problem, but one that the pandemic has both exposed and deepened. The weakness of employment rights and the imbalance of power between workers and bosses has gone unaddressed for too long. Throughout the pandemic, the devastating consequences of unsafe working conditions, financial insecurity and the lack of a strong worker voice have made the need for urgent change clear.
Yet the government has shown no intention of making this change. It has ditched its long-promised employment bill. Over the past 16 months, a lack of clarity about safe working practices and weak enforcement of health and safety laws have endangered workers on the frontline and resulted in thousands of avoidable deaths.

                    <span>Inspired by a desire to be good and help others during the pandemic, novelist Sarah Perry trained to vaccinate people. But what does it mean to be good when there is so much bad faith?
Earlier this year – lockdown three: no sign of spring – I travelled to an airport to try to be good. Dogged for months by the sense of my own uselessness, and having wept with relief and accumulated sorrow when the first Covid-19 vaccine was approved, I’d joined an organisation training volunteers to deliver vaccinations, and so arrived at a desolate Stansted shortly after dawn. Here I sat in the basement of a hotel fallen almost out of use, and in the company of a hundred strangers – though alone and masked in a square of carpet marked out with black tape – learned how to treat fainting fits, panic attacks and anaphylactic shock. In our number were a circus performer, a firefighter, a consultant of some kind; and having been starved of unfamiliar faces for so long we were all, I think, happy to be there (putting a woman in the recovery position I apologised for what seemed a shocking intimacy; but she said what a pleasure it was, after all that time, to be touched). Then we attached sponges to our upper arms, and learned how to insert the needle at 45 degrees, stretching the skin to avoid a bleed; how to depress the plunger, and then remove the needle without doing ourselves a mischief. Then, observed by the nurse, who’d hurried out of retirement to train us, we demonstrated our prowess, were awarded a certificate, and went home to await deployment.

                    <span>2021 is already the deadliest year on record for Florida manatees. Scientists and activists are scrambling to avert further disaster
On a bright morning in July, a crowd gathered on a boat ramp in St Augustine, Florida, awaiting the arrival of a young male manatee named Gerard. The marshy Matanzas River gently flowed around oyster beds and sawgrass islands as biologists organized their equipment. Nearby about a dozen onlookers paced by the shore, waiting to catch a glimpse of Gerard’s return to the wild following weeks of captivity.
Earlier in spring, beachgoers discovered Gerard stranded and sunbaked in Palm Coast, about 25 miles south of St Augustine, on the Atlantic Ocean. Samaritans draped wet towels over the feeble marine mammal, keeping him cool and shaded from the subtropical sun, as a rescue team raced to the scene. Gravely thin, Gerard was transported to Jacksonville Zoo, where he spent the next 10 weeks in critical care until he was plump enough to re-enter the wild.

In May last year, Sky Brown, the young skateboarding phenom, almost died when she fell 15ft onto her head while transitioning between vert ramps at a skate park in California. The horrifying impact fractured the 12-year-old’s skull, broke her wrist and hand, and left her unconscious as she was airlifted to hospital.
Footage of the accident was uploaded to Brown’s popular YouTube channel and viewed millions of times. Lesser skaters would feel deeply uneasy about returning to the sport and repeating such tricks, but not Brown: she’s famed for being fearless.

Modern Toss on comedy at the fringe
the best of fringe, in person and online

It’s a feeling of pure joy. Over the last year and a half, I’ve recorded a lot of stuff in what I pretentiously call the studio at the end of the garden, but the fringe? I’ve spent a month every year for the past 21 years at the fringe. Weirdly, what I miss is the liminal time backstage with other comedians. Even if you absolutely storm a Zoom gig, with one click of a button you go from being on stage to instantly back in the hotel room. It’s very disconcerting. When the pandemic kicked in, I was in the middle of a tour of Ireland. At the end of 2019 I did I’m a Celebrity, and the show was called Reality – it was a bit of a play on that. I was going to take it to the fringe in 2020, but obviously it got parked. In the meantime, I carried on writing. So the show is now an amalgam of two years of material. Does it mention Covid? I’ll always point out an elephant in the room. I won’t necessarily discuss the trunk of the elephant for a solid hour or what shade of grey it is, but I always mention the elephant.

The US Department of Justice sued Texas Governor Greg Abbott today over his order to stop migrants from entering the state or being transported through it, unless by law enforcement officials. 
According to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in El Paso, only the federal government has jurisdiction over immigration, Reuters reports. 
 The order, which Abbott signed on Wednesday, permits only ‘law enforcement officials’ to provide ground transport for migrants detained for illegally crossing the southern border. It also gives the state’s public safety department the authority to stop any vehicle suspected of carrying migrants and send it back to its point of origin.

The order would interfere with the U.S. government’s ability to transport migrants between facilities, including unaccompanied children, according to the lawsuit. The government regularly employs contractors and other non-law enforcement personnel to transfer migrants.

Mexico’s health ministry has confirmed another 459 people died from Covid-19 on Friday, bringing the death toll to at least 240,456. 
The real figure is thought to be up to 60% higher, due to problems with reporting.

                    <span>While tonight at the Royal Albert Hall wasn’t quite back to normal it offered some joyful moments
The first Prom to welcome an audience back into the Royal Albert Hall began with a work of low-key celebration, Vaughan Williams’s Serenade to Music. As its last chord died away, something else took its place: a collective silence, the kind that’s conjured when hundreds of people hold their breath, all listening intently to the same thing. This kind of delicious communal moment is what was missing last summer, when the Proms were performed with no audience in the hall.
Things aren’t quite back to normal yet. This season runs for six weeks, not eight. To make more room for distanced orchestral players, the stage has been expanded. And although seats are being sold with no social distancing and there’s the potential for audiences to reach something approaching 5,000, that wasn’t the case: the arena can’t have held more than 150 prommers standing, and anyone daunted by the idea of sitting up close to a stranger for two hours will have been reassured to see plenty of empty seats. But the audience was big enough to create a buzz. As the conductor Dalia Stasevska greeted the audience with a delighted wave, the mood was jubilant.

                    <span>After 17 years at the BBC – from embarrassing herself in front of Pete Tong to forgetting she interviewed Rihanna – Mac hangs up her headphones with an emotional plea to her many fans
Annie Mac has a terrible memory. It’s a trait the DJ has mentioned repeatedly in interviews – often blaming her profession’s sleepless lifestyle – and even based an entire podcast series around: Finding Annie was premised on her desire to dig up lost memories related to crucial aspects of her life, from childbirth to Irishness.
It’s also been a running joke on her final stretch of BBC Radio 1 shows. As the 43-year-old prepares to depart the station this week after 17 years of broadcasting, she has found herself with the strange task of summing up her own legacy – which is especially hard when you can’t recall great swathes of your career (including an interview with Rihanna). Luckily, the BBC archives act as a handy back-up memory. Mac starts her final broadcast by replaying her first ever link on her first ever show, 2004’s The Mash Up. Self-effacingly recounting her failure to find something with “symbolism and hidden meaning” to kick things off, the young Mac has instead resorted to a track by High Contrast notable only for sparking joy. This show, she concludes, is “all about things that make you jump up and down and say yeah!”

As well as stepping back for the sake of his mental wellbeing, the 30-year-old is also seeking to rest his injured left index finger, which has not fully healed since his return to competitive cricket.

The Delta variant spreads much faster, is more likely to infect the vaccinated, and could potentially trigger more severe illness in the unvaccinated compared with all other known variants, according to an internal report compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The document, a slide presentation prepared by officials within the US’s health protection agency first obtained by the Washington Post, warned that the Delta variant is as infectious as chickenpox, and argues that government officials must “acknowledge the war has changed” given how dangerous the variant is.

                    <span>An ancient Roman ship carrying a cargo load of wine jars, or amphorae, has been found underwater in the Mediterranean Sea off the Italian island of Sicily. The vessel was discovered during an underwater reconnaissance expedition by the island&#x27;s Regional Agency for Environment Protection. The findings will shed light on Rome’s trade activity in the Mediterranean, where the Romans traded spices, wine, olives and other products in north Africa, Spain, France and the Middle East

The publishing company and widow of Jacques Levy, a collaborator on the 1976 album Desire, sought at least $7.25m from the sale of 10 songs. Dylan said Levy worked under agreement and was only entitled to a percentage of royalties.

Pressure is mounting on ministers to outlaw “no jab, no job” policies being implemented by companies, amid warnings firms could be hit by a wave of legal action due to claims of discrimination.
After major US businesses including Google and Facebook announced plans to only allow fully vaccinated staff to set foot in their offices due to the spread of the Delta variant already rampant in the UK, senior government figures on this side of the Atlantic appeared relaxed about other businesses following suit.

Bellerín and Xhaka keen to move and have suitors

Arsenal have completed the signing of Ben White from Brighton in a £50m deal that makes him their third-most expensive arrival of all time, and will now turn their attention to persuading two senior players to stay at the Emirates.
White had been one of Mikel Arteta’s top summer targets and his ability to pass out from defence, as well as step into midfield, was seen as a key component in speeding up Arsenal’s game in possession. Although the 23-year-old centre-back effectively replaces David Luiz, he is more than a decade younger and appears yet to reach his ceiling. He will take the No 4 shirt and has signed a five-year contract.

Crammed full of wig-wearing barristers, and with reporters sent up to the public gallery, courtroom four heard Hugh Tomlinson QC say that his client – one of the complainants and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich – understood that his action could be construed as “an attack on free speech and public interest journalism”.

MPs enjoyed a bonanza of free tickets this summer worth more than £100,000 from gambling, drinks and sporting companies as they took advantage of the government’s Covid pilot scheme for large events.
Cabinet ministers Ben Wallace and Brandon Lewis, plus the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, were among those who benefited from free tickets declared during July, with more than 35 MPs in total accepting hospitality as they took part in the research project.

                    <span>The attitude of Republican politicians to the committee shows exactly why it is needed
The investigation into the deadly insurrection of 6 January is not one but two processes. The first is an attempt to discover the truth about those events: not only what happened, but who, beyond the members of the mob, was responsible and in what ways. The second is the task of getting people to accept that truth – knowing that many will not.
Senior Republicans initially acknowledged the horror of the events and the culpability of Donald Trump, whose big lie of a stolen election triggered the assault upon the Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader – who is said to have telephoned the president urging him to call the rioters off as they tried to break through his office window – said that Mr Trump bore responsibility. He and others called for a 9/11-style independent commission.

                    <span>The sale of the only copy of an album for $2m is a reminder that canny rappers understood the artistic value of the original and the authentic
When Martin Shkreli was convicted of fraud in 2017, the authorities ordered him to give up his assets, which included a Picasso, a share-trading account and the only existing copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, a double album by the American hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan. This week an anonymous buyer purchased the record to clear the disgraced pharmaceutical executive’s remaining $2.2m debt to the US government and committed to Wu-Tang Clan’s stipulation that it not be released commercially until 2103.
The sale is a testament to both the artists and their art. The rap group – RZA, GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, Masta Killa and sometimes Cappadonna – emerged in the 1990s and challenged hip-hop’s aesthetic principles and its business model. With interests in martial arts, philosophy and mystical Islam, their wordplay set them apart. On their 1997 track Triumph, Inspectah Deck raps “I bomb atomically, Socrates’ philosophies and hypotheses / Can’t define how I be dropping these mockeries”.

Last week, the company was convicted of sending more than 1,000 tonnes of household waste to India and Indonesia, in breach of a ban on sending such waste to developing countries after a two-week trial at Wood Green crown court .

At 8.14pm Tokyo time, as the public address burbled weirdly and a crew of Lycra-wrapped athletes, male and female, collapsed together in a narrow corner of the Tokyo Olympic stadium, Marvin Schlegel, a 23-year-old German runner, leapt up on to a concrete walkway above the running track and began to roar into the empty space.
Fists clenched, neck muscles fanned, Schlegel continued to roar, a kind of wild-man victory bark. Ten minutes earlier he had run the anchor leg in Germany’s mixed 4x400 relay team. His quartet, two women and two men, had just qualified for Saturday’s Olympic final by the finest of margins.

The main UN compound in the capital of the western Afghan province of Herat was attacked by “anti-government elements” on Friday and at least one security guard was killed, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said.
The attack, involving rocket-propelled grenades and guns, happened hours after Taliban fighters penetrated deep into Herat city, and heavy clashes with Afghan security forces took place near the UNAMA provincial headquarters, officials said.

                    <span>Mercedes and Red Bull spat builds before Hungarian GP
Max Verstappen quickest in Friday morning’s practice session

Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen may want to do their talking on track at this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix but their teams remain firmly entrenched in opposition as the verbal sallies continued to fly on Friday at the Hungaroring. After the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers clashed at the British Grand Prix, the tension of an already fiercely fought championship ratcheted up a level and neither teams nor drivers are clearly ready yet for a rapprochement.
On Thursday Red Bull’s request for a review into the drivers’ clash at Silverstone was rejected by the FIA stewards. The incident in which Verstappen was knocked out of the race in an 180mph crash after Hamilton clipped him attempting to pass at Copse left Red Bull furious, with their team principal, Christian Horner, accusing the world champion of dirty driving. The Dutch driver also blamed his Mercedes counterpart while Hamilton, although given a 10-second penalty for being predominantly at fault, bullishly insisted he would repeat the move again if given the chance.

It certainly felt like a British music festival. A band was playing on the main stage, food vans dispensed trays and across the field people filed in and out of a big tent. There was even standard festival weather: bright sunshine with the threat of rain and, inevitably, mud.
This was no Glasto, though. It was the summer vaccine festival in east London, where people were being encouraged to walk in, get a Covid jab and then enjoy free food and music.

                    <span>Pat Simmons and Paul Williams on the pleasures of swimming in rivers, lakes and seas in harmony with nature
Wild swimming “the latest fashionable activity” (Letters, 26 July)? Hardly. Seventy years ago I learned to swim in the River Wey, in the company of other local kids (and a lot of water voles and a pair of nesting swans). Forty-five years ago we spent innumerable happy afternoons with our children swimming and splashing in the River Cherwell at Wolvercote – and there were other popular river bathing places in Oxford. Last week I took my granddaughter swimming in the River Chew. Wild swimming is certainly not a new fashion, though it has become riskier with the current levels of pollution in our rivers and lakes (not very beneficial for kingfishers, either).

• I’ve been swimming locally for five years. Most of the year I’m accompanied by seals, otters, geese, oystercatchers and a variety of other seabirds. In summer, the campervans roll in. Their owners don’t swim, but the wildlife disappears – so don’t blame the swimmers for disturbing wildlife.

                    <span>Steve Cushion on the Pennant family, who used the profits made by enslaved workers in Jamaica to expand the Penrhyn slate quarry
Your article (Welsh slate landscape becomes UK’s newest world heritage site, 28 July) did not mention the origins of the finance that enabled the expansion of the slate quarries at the end of the 18th century. In 1781, Richard Pennant inherited the family’s estates in Jamaica and in north Wales. He owned four sugar plantations in Jamaica, worked by more than a thousand enslaved workers. The money Pennant generated from sugar and slavery in Jamaica was invested in building road, railway and port infrastructure, as well as expanding the slate industry in Wales, in particular his Penrhyn slate quarry.
Pennant became MP for Petersfield in 1761 and, in 1767, one of the two MPs for Liverpool, Britain’s major slave trading port. He was chairman of the West India Committee, an organisation of merchants and plantation owners that campaigned for the continuation of slavery. He frequently spoke in the Commons against abolition of the slave trade.

Esther Cudjoe Pontara doesn’t have much faith in the police. The 19-year-old, who lives in Streatham in south London, described nearly all her interactions with officers as negative.
“I’ve always had negative interactions with the police. [A few months ago] I was walking into school and we had a school police officer and I’d apparently given him a dirty look. He proceeded to come into my school, which was against the protocol, then he took me into a room and started saying these racist, misogynistic things, and making me feel uncomfortable,” she said. “People just have no faith in the system whatsoever.”

Springboks lash out at touring side ahead of second Test 

The South Africa captain Siya Kolisi has made the remarkable claim that he was shown a lack of respect by the referee Nic Berry during last Saturday’s defeat by the British &amp; Irish Lions as the Springboks lashed out at the touring side, accusing Warren Gatland of “destroying the dignity of the series”.
Doubling down on Rassie Erasmus’s outburst over perceived injustices from officials as the extraordinary war of words intensified before Saturday’s second Test, Kolisi agreed with his director of rugby that he was treated differently to the Lions captain Alun Wyn Jones. The Springboks assistant Mzwandile Stick then took a swipe at Gatland for making his anger known about the appointment of the South African TMO Marius Jonker last week. Earlier, Rugby Australia slammed Erasmus for an “unacceptable” attack on Berry, labelling his rant as “against the spirit and values of the game”.

Fitba is back in earnest on Saturday and it’s always fascinating to see how teams have limbered up for the big kick-off. Full speed to Tynecastle, then, where Hearts return to the big time and face the Queen’s Celtic while riding the wave of back-to-back Skol Cup triumphs against Stirling Albion and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. So far, so normal. But what about the Queen’s Celtic? They’ve prepared in the fashion they know best: by tumbling out of Big Cup qualifiers against opponents who, historically, they would have expected to dismiss in relative comfort.

                    <span>Naval strike group is sailing through waters heavily contested between China and neighbouring countries
Britain has said it has no plans to stage a naval confrontation with China in the South China Sea and that it aims to send its carrier strike group in the most direct route across the contested body of water from Singapore to the Philippine Sea.
The cooling message emerged hours after China’s military and state media warned the UK against provocation as the group, led by Royal Navy aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth, undertakes what had been expected to be a more assertive deployment.

Even though my breakup was amicable, I felt a lot of guilt – so when I moved out I said: “Keep it all.” But, in the years since, there have been a few items of kitchenware that I wish I’d held on to: a Le Creuset casserole dish, my favourite mug, a digital cooking thermometer, the plastic bowl attachment for my stick blender (the blender itself I retained at her insistence, but I forgot all the accessories that came with it). There never seemed like a good time to ask for any of it back – I hope she’s at least getting some use out of them. Anonymous, Australia

Team GB had come from behind to lead until an 89th-minute goal from the Chelsea striker Sam Kerr forced another 30 minutes.

When, still damp from the pool after winning his long-awaited gold medal, British diver Tom Daley declared his pride at being a gay man and also an Olympic champion, there were tears and full hearts across the nation.
And while there was little shock – Daley has been a vocal advocate of LGBTQ+ rights for years – there was a joy and ease to his pronouncement that was new. With more publicly out athletes in these Olympics than in all other Games combined, Tokyo 2020 is being hailed as the Rainbow Olympics, with LGBTQ+ rights campaigners hoping its message of positive inclusivity can have a lasting, global impact.

A stunning medal double on the BMX track added to Great Britain’s Tokyo Olympics haul on a day of frenetic activity in which the squad won six medals to take Team GB’s overall tally to 26.
Great Britain also progressed to the semi-finals of the women’s rugby sevens on Friday but there was heartache in the football as the women lost 4-3 to Australia in an extra-time thriller and failed to progress beyond the quarter-finals. There were more medals in the pool, in trampolining and a final bronze in the rowing – bringing to a close an otherwise disappointing regatta for Great Britain.

I am expecting a baby later this year. Despite living in a different country, my mother wants to be as involved as she can. I benefited hugely from my relationship with my grandparents and would love my child to have the same.
However, I have a lot of unresolved issues about the way my mother parented me, and the way she behaves today. She was dismissive of my depression and anxiety when I was growing up, and lacked empathy when I self-harmed. She would bring everything back to her, and was scathing of my attempts to treat myself to anything nice. I don’t know how to help build a positive relationship between my child and my mother, when I am mistrustful and wary of her behaviour.

Many things have disappeared from British politics since it became mostly about the pandemic. One of the most important has been the idea that the interests and grievances of people under 40 are worth a lot of attention from the main parties.
During the Jeremy Corbyn era younger voters enjoyed rare influence, reinvigorating Labour and frightening the Conservatives. Even when that period effectively ended at the 2019 election, Labour beat the Tories among voters aged 18 to 24 by an unprecedented 43 percentage points. The sea of young faces at Corbyn rallies looked like a mass awakening that would have consequences.

                    <span>Thought to be the first blue-collar female novelist, Holdsworth once outsold HG Wells. Now reprints and an alternative blue plaque aim to restore her reputation
Ethel Carnie Holdsworth wrote in 1914 that “literature up till now has been lopsided, dealing with life only from the standpoint of one class”. Now the Lancashire mill worker and author, a forgotten name who is believed to be the first working-class woman in Britain to publish a novel, and who in her heyday outsold HG Wells, is set to be celebrated with an alternative blue plaque and a return to print.
Born in Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire in 1886, Holdsworth began working in a textile factory at the age of 11. She also wrote poetry, saying that the rhythm of the looms helped her compose her lines. Dubbed the “Lancashire mill girl poetess” by the local paper, she came to the attention of journalist Robert Blatchford, who gave her a job on his magazine, the Woman Worker. Holdsworth published her first novel, Miss Nobody, in 1913 and went on to write a further nine. She also set up anti-fascist journal the Clear Light, and helped other working-class women learn to read and write. She stopped writing novels in 1946, worn out by the process according to her daughter.

Amanda Knox has accused actor Matt Damon and director Tom McCarthy of “rip[ping] off my story without my consent at the expense of my reputation” in the upcoming film Stillwater, which McCarthy has said was inspired by Knox’s experience after the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy.
In an essay on the online publishing platform Medium, Knox takes particular aim at McCarthy, who told Vanity Fair that Stillwater was directly inspired by the Kercher case, which resulted in Knox being wrongly convicted for Kercher’s murder along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and spending four years in prison, before ultimately being acquitted in 2015 by Italy’s supreme court of cassation. Rudy Guede, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2008, is the only person convicted of Kercher’s murder.

                    <span>The actor, writer and director is about to publish her first book – let us know what you’d like to ask her
In September, the acclaimed actor, screenwriter and director Michaela Coel will publish her debut book, Misfits: A Personal Manifesto (Ebury Press, £9.99). It will draw on her 2018 MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV festival, in which she talked about feeling like an outsider, and made a case for embracing our differences rather than attempting to fit in.
Last year’s I May Destroy You, the 12-part BBC/HBO comedy-drama she created and starred in alongside Weruche Opia and Paapa Essiedu, addressed issues of consent and sexual assault, social media, race and class. It won two Baftas and three Bafta Crafts awards and is nominated for nine Emmys. The Guardian named it the best show of 2020.

Conditions that led to 2011 UK riots still exist today, experts warn

On 4 August 2011, Mark Duggan was shot and killed by police in Tottenham, north London, sparking the largest civil unrest the UK has seen for a generation. The disturbance quickly spread and for five nights, London, Birmingham, and other major cities in England were engulfed by fire and violence.
On the 10th anniversary of the riot, community leaders and frontline workers reflect on what they witnessed and the impact of those nights.

I have dealt in the past with the ongoing issues related to my inner prick – a voice inside my head that is consistently telling me that I am terrible at everything and should give up as soon as possible. (Sometimes that is my inner prick, and sometimes it is me repeating the comments below the online version of this column.)
I spoke to a couple of people who told me that I needed to retrain this voice to be nicer to me. I went to a therapist who told me to imagine I was sitting on the sofa opposite and to practise being nice to myself. I do find therapy useful, but it does require that you leave self-awareness at the door. I was slightly self-conscious about the fact that I was telling an invisible me that I am actually a very nice man (particularly as I am not entirely sure I believe that).

David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham

Every riot needs a spark. In 1985, I was a teenager when the Broadwater Farm riot took place just yards away from my home. It was lit by the death of Cynthia Jarrett, who suffered a stroke after police officers searched her home. Ten years ago, the riots that again began in Tottenham were ignited by the death of Mark Duggan, who was shot by the police.
The destruction that followed in both cases was horrific, as peaceful protests were hijacked by violent criminals. In 1985, PC Keith Blakelock was killed. In 2011, eight police officers in Tottenham were hospitalised and more than £200m of damage was caused nationwide. I will never forget walking up Tottenham High Road on the Sunday morning after the night before and seeing bricks through broken windows, alongside burned-out cars and shopfronts, and parents standing on the street in their pyjamas comforting their children. In both cases, the peaceful majority of local residents could only watch as their shops, homes and businesses were senselessly turned into ashes by the flames of the mob.

‘The Mark Duggan case was a catalyst’: the 2011 UK riots 10 years on

The conditions that led to riots across England 10 years ago still exist today, experts have warned, as data analysis showed significant cuts to youth services in affected areas and an increase in racial disparity in stop and search.
On 4 August 2011, police officers shot and killed Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old mixed-race man, in Tottenham, north London. His death sparked a wave of civil unrest that started the capital and spread to other cities, causing property damage to the value of £40m a day.

Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the contract, which was awarded after the personal intervention of Boris Johnson’s then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.

Brett McGurk, a top Biden administration adviser on the Middle East, raised questions privately about NSO in a meeting last week with Zohar Palti, a senior Israeli defence ministry official, according to reports by Axios and the Washington Post.

Coronavirus – latest updates

After two months of rising Covid-19 cases in the UK, people have celebrated falling numbers in the past week. But the number of deaths from the virus rose to 131 on Tuesday, the highest since March. Behind those numbers are lives lost and grieving families urging people to get vaccinated and keep taking precautions.
Among those dealing with their grief is Paul Nuttall after the death of his 24-year-old son, Billy – affectionately called “sunbeam” by his dad for his ability to light up a room.
Billy, an Oxford history graduate who was doing a master’s in politics at Manchester, had his life shaken by Covid. He had isolated – barely leaving the house – for 18 months and because of this he gained weight, reaching 190kg (30st). He went to fitness classes with his dad but before they could really make a difference he caught Covid and died on 26 July.

Ernest Hemingway is survived as much by his macho mythology as he is by his writing. Hemingway was in two plane crashes in two days. Hemingway shot himself in both legs while wrangling a shark. Hemingway had at least nine major concussions – and four wives. He had brain damage. He won the Pulitzer and the Nobel prize. He hunted and fished and wrote plays and books and articles and stories, for ever in pursuit of the truest sentence. He was rageful, charming, violent, brilliant and drunk.
Hemingway is also something of a Key West mascot, especially for a week every July, when a festival called Hemingway Days, which coincides with his birthday (this year, he would be 122) honours his legacy by gathering his lookalikes together.

                    <span>We would like to hear from women who took part  in the peace protest at Greenham Common 
It is nearly 40 years since women first set up a peace camp outside RAF Greenham Common in protest against the storage of US cruise missiles on British soil. 
On the 5th September 1981, a Welsh women’s group, marched from Cardiff to Greenham Common in Berkshire to protest against Nato’s decision to site 96 US cruise nuclear missiles at the RAF base. The women-only peace protest lasted 19 years.

See all our coronavirus coverage

After five weeks of a tightening lockdown, they were not the words Sydney residents wanted to hear: the leader of New South Wales announcing another month of restrictions and telling the state to prepare for things to get worse, not better.
There was further anguish prompted by the daily Covid case numbers, which were rising daily, despite strict stay at home measures.

Mushrooms, toads and moss might not be the most celebrated of nature’s creations, but thanks to goblincore, an aesthetic that is blossoming online as well as in forests, the danker, gnarlier side of nature is enjoying a moment in the sun.
According to the TikTok user @froggiecrocs, AKA Parker, who has more than 90,000 followers who tune in for his goblincore content, it “romanticizes the ugly, lesser appreciated parts of the natural world”. Its trappings include animal skulls and earthworms and its influences range from David Bowie in Labyrinth to the Twilight Saga. According to the trends expert Sabrina Faramarzi, it is about “chaos, dirt and mud”.

                    <span>It has cost the taxpayer billions without a mile of track being laid – and it won’t even go north of Crewe
Britain’s new high-speed railway will not – repeat: not – get to the north of England. It will go back and forth from London to the Midlands and its chief beneficiaries will be London commuters. All else is political spin.
This became certain last week as the government’s internal major projects authority declared phase two of the HS2 project, to Manchester and Leeds, effectively dead. While the already-started London-to-Birmingham stretch is still marked at “amber/red” for “successful delivery in doubt”, anything north of Crewe has been designated “unachievable”. Its multitudinous issues “do not appear to be manageable or resolvable”. This comes not from the arms-length National Infrastructure Commission or last winter’s Oakervee report, both agreeing that going beyond Birmingham should be “reviewed”. This was the verdict of an arm of the Treasury and Cabinet Office.

“It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions,” declared Ronald Reagan at the 1968 Republican National Convention.
By the time he became president 12 years later, this idea – that individuals can be trusted to act wisely and should be held accountable when they don’t – was firmly entrenched in Republican rhetoric. Reagan even included “personal responsibility” in his list of America’s bedrock values, right up there with faith in God, honesty, and caring for others.

UK cultural landmarks such as Stonehenge could be stripped of their coveted world heritage status unless the government curbs “ill-advised development” and protects historic sites for future generations, a Unesco chief has warned.
Dr Mechtild Rössler, the director of Unesco’s World Heritage Centre, urged ministers to “do everything” they could to conserve the UK’s treasures after Liverpool became only the third place in nearly 50 years to lose its revered title.

I had high hopes for this diplomatic incident masquerading as a TV travelogue through Scotland. Fingers crossed, patriarchy’s answer to Katie Hopkins and the Cheeky Girls would get chucked out of Scotland just as they were from Argentina while filming Top Gear. During that 2014 debacle, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond were attacked for driving a Porsche whose number plate – H982 FKL – was deemed a reference to Britain’s victory in the 1982 Falklands conflict. In the resulting unpleasantness, the three presenters took a helicopter to safety, like the last chopper out of Saigon, leaving the crew to defend that oxymoron, British honour.
Indeed, there is surely nothing more apt to make Nicola Sturgeon unleash the ancestral claymore than the sight of three English muppets in gas-guzzling Yank tanks (Lincoln Continental, Cadillac Coupe de Ville and Buick Riviera, each more productive of Greta Thunberg’s tears than a cormorant with its beak stuck in a can of Irn-Bru) heading north from Berwick-upon-Tweed.

                    <span>Murphy says 200m backstroke final ‘probably not clean’
Russian winner Rylov says: ‘Ryan didn’t accuse me of anything’

A storm broke out at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre on Friday morning when Ryan Murphy, the USA’s silver medallist in the 200m backstroke, spoke out against the sport’s doping problem and said he was “swimming in a race that’s probably not clean”. Almost any other time, this would have been an admirably honest thing to do, but the problem was Murphy had only just lost to Evgeny Rylov, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, and the comments came across as an accusation. Rylov, 24, won both the 100m and 200m backstroke this week, the 200m with an Olympic record time of 1min 53.27sec.
“I’ve got about 15 thoughts, and 13 of them would get me into a lot of trouble,” Murphy said after the race. “It is a huge mental drain to go through the year knowing that I’m swimming in a race that’s probably not clean, and that is what it is. The people that know a lot more about the situation made the decision that they did. I don’t have the bandwidth to train for the Olympics at a very high level and try to lobby the people that are making the decisions that they’re making the wrong decisions.”

                    <span>It’s right that these post-industrial landscapes, with their complex history, should have world heritage status
“The slate quarries are beautiful,” a friend told me, having returned from a holiday in Gwynedd, where I grew up. “They are not so beautiful when your ancestors died in them,” I said, half-joking just to see her face. The windows of my childhood home looked out at that landscape, the mountain a series of gradated ledges, like a staircase built for a giant. The workers were long gone, but I used to imagine them, hanging from thin bits of rope hundreds of feet in the air, risking their lives for a pittance, when I watched the rock climbers who flock to the area from all over the world.
Now, after a long local campaign led by bid leader Dafydd Wigley, the slate landscapes of north Wales have won world heritage status in recognition of 1,800 years of slate mining; the people, culture and language, and how the slate from these quarries, as is often said, used to roof the world. The skills of the workers, most of them Welsh-speaking, are now consigned only to museum demonstrations. I was quite small when I first watched a man split a slate with a chisel and mallet and saw the purplish sheet become thinner and thinner beneath his hands. In my father’s house there is a slate fan made by one of our ancestors as an apprentice. There was great pride in those skills, and there continues to be. World heritage status feels like a recognition of that.

My childhood was perfect. I was born and raised in New Jersey and lived in a lovely house with my family around me. For my sixth birthday my mom went all out with a Pocahontas theme – it was amazing. It’s the last beautiful memory I have of my family together. A month later, in December 1995, we were due to travel to Colombia as a family for the first time. I was so excited as it was going to be my first flight. We were travelling to meet family members I had never met before, for a big reunion.
We were rushing on the way to the airport and our car almost flipped over on the way because of the snow on the roads, so we were delayed. It was chaos once we got there – rush, rush, rush. We only just boarded on time, and the plane took off late.

Karapiru, one of the last of the hunter-gatherer nomadic Awá of Maranhão state, died of Covid-19 earlier this month. With only 300 Awá thought to remain, they have been called the “earth’s most threatened tribe”.

                    <span>The Tokyo Games have shone a light on bullying, abuse and sexualisation, which are too often ignored in the pursuit of glory
Nobody should have to go to work in their bra and knickers. So when the Norwegian women’s beach handball team were fined earlier this month for defiantly choosing to compete in shorts – rather than the buttock-revealingly skimpy bikini bottoms mandated by their sport’s governing body – it was the organisers of the European championships, not the squad, who ended up looking ridiculous. Why should female athletes have to be served up half-naked, for the benefit of leering audiences?
But the rebellious Norwegians, it turns out, were merely the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Now the Tokyo Olympics are witnessing what looks very much like the beginnings of a movement, as sportswomen increasingly speak out about their experiences of sexualisation and exploitation.

Over the past 18 months, the world has been amazed at how slippery an enemy Covid-19 has proved to be. The virus first detected in China at the end of 2019 has mutated on a regular basis. Vaccines need to evolve because the virus is changing to survive.
The shock to the global economy from the pandemic has been colossal, but things are now looking up – especially for advanced countries. Some are surprised by the pace of recovery, but they perhaps shouldn’t be, because alongside new variants of the virus there has been a new variant of global capitalism.

                    <span>It’s the world’s most widely used psychoactive drug, it disrupts our sleep, it makes us grumpy when we miss it – and we give it to our children. What keeps us coming back?
When Michael Pollan was researching caffeine for his book about naturally occurring drugs, he decided to give it up for three months. The process was not easy: “I was still not quite myself, and neither, quite, was the world,” he writes. “In this new normal, the world seemed duller to me. I seemed duller, too.”
But through his research and his experiences, Pollan came to a view of caffeine that acknowledged its downsides but also embraced its considerable benefits. He tells Rachel Humphreys (who has bravely gone nearly a day without a coffee at the time of the interview and is already feeling the effect) the remarkable story of how caffeine became the world’s dominant drug, and the only one which we have incorporated into day-to-day conventional life – one we hardly think of as a drug at all. With 90% of us taking it regularly, as Pollan notes, “For most of us, to be caffeinated to one degree or another has simply become baseline human consciousness.”

Jackson Lee’s arrest came after a House oversight subcommittee hearing in which Texas Democrats who traveled to DC in order to detail voting restrictions in their state explained how the voting restrictions would disenfranchise Black and minority voters. 
The Democrats had walked out to deny Republicans the two-thirds quorum required to carry out their plan to pass measures that would impose id-requirements on mail-in ballots and ban 24-hour and drive-through voting among other restrictions.

The announcement by Naftali Bennett makes Israel, which launched one of the world’s most successful vaccination drives earlier this year, the first country to offer a third dose of a western vaccine to its citizens on a wide scale.

A few hours after docking, Nauka’s propulsive devices unexpectedly fired, forcing personnel aboard the ISS to fire thrusters on the Russian segment of the station to counter the effect.

More than 5 million people had a parcel lost or stolen last year, according to Citizens Advice, which has called on the government to start fining firms that keep losing deliveries as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the sector.
Currently, only Royal Mail faces fines for poor service, but the charity said the same sanctions should apply to the whole industry, after surveys showed customers had experienced a range of problems with deliveries. Ten parcels were lost or stolen during each minute over the last 12 months, it claimed.

On perhaps the most anticipated album of 2021, Eilish uses subdued yet powerful songwriting to consider how fame has seeped into every corner of her life 

“I’m getting older,” sings Billie Eilish, who’s 19, on Happier Than Ever’s opening track. “I’ve got more on my shoulders”, she adds, which is certainly true. Her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? wasn’t just a huge global hit, but an album that significantly altered mainstream pop music. Two years on, streaming services are clotted with bedroom-bound, teenage singer-songwriters dolefully depicting their lives: anticipation for what the genuine article does next is understandably running very high.
When We All Fall Asleep … was an album that turned universal teenage traumas – romance, hedonism, friendship groups – into knowingly lurid horror-comic fantasies, in which tongues were stapled, friends buried, hearses slept in and marble walls spattered with blood. That playfulness is less evident on its successor. It flickers occasionally, as on Overheated’s exploration of stardom in the era of social media, complete with death threats (“You wanna kill me? You wanna hurt me?” she mumbles, before giggling: “Stop being flirty”) or on NDA, where the “pretty boy” she entices home is required to sign the titular legal agreement before he leaves. But the overall tone is noticeably more sombre.

                    <span>The drive for reform caused by the Stephen Lawrence scandal has stalled. A new Commons committee report issues a summons to action
It is 28 years since Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south London in an unprovoked racist knife attack, and 22 years since Sir William Macpherson published his groundbreaking report into the police handling of the case. The report led to significant reforms in the law, in policing, in addressing institutional racism and in the attention given to racist crimes. Since then, the pace of reform has slowed. Habits of unequal enforcement have crept back into police relations with black people and other minority communities, slowing the push towards equal recruitment and widening the gap in public confidence. It is past time to take up the cause of reform again.
In an important review of progress and setbacks since Macpherson, the Commons home affairs committee calls today for a new sense of urgency over these vital issues. It is important to recognise that the committee is composed of MPs from across parliament. Four of the members who adopted the report are Conservatives; four, including the chair, Yvette Cooper, are Labour, and one is a Scottish nationalist. In other words, this is a genuinely all-party report, and the authority of its conclusions is greatly enhanced by it.

Police and governments have done too little to stamp out racial injustice in the ranks, with the failings being systemic and leading to “unjustified inequalities”, a report by an all-party committee of MPs has found.
The report by the home affairs committee was heavily critical of the progress made in the 22 years since the Macpherson report into why the white killers of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to go free, which blamed “institutional racism”

Coronavirus – latest updates

England’s top midwife is urging expectant mums to get the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible, as new data suggests a worrying rise in Covid-19 hospital admissions among unvaccinated pregnant women in the UK.
There is also evidence that the Delta variant poses a significantly greater risk to pregnant women than previous strains.

As part of Netflix’s recent quarterly update, the ever-expanding streamer bragged that this last year saw their biggest animated film to date, yet another sign of their all-conquering versatility. But despite a concerted effort to increase in-house animation, the movie in question was tellingly not one of their own creation but rather a Covid acquisition, made and primed by Sony for a big-screen release but panic-sold when cinemas shuttered.

                    <span>A powerful new book from the author of White Fragility reveals why profound racism is often found in supposedly liberal spaces
In 1952, the anti-racist activist and librarian Juliette Hampton Morgan famously observed in a letter to a friend that polite white people were “our biggest problem” in combating American white supremacy. The outspoken southern white writer and teacher had been pulling emergency brakes on buses in Montgomery, Alabama when black patrons were intentionally left on the sidewalk, and wrote letters to local newspapers critiquing segregation. What horrified her just as much as the normalised treatment of black Americans was the way white decency obstructed social change. Seventy years later, Robin DiAngelo explores some of the enduring facets of this practice.
Citing deeply revealing and recurring anecdotes from her career as an anti-racist educator, DiAngelo analyses how white Americans who deem themselves inoculated against racism uniquely embody racist practices, including herself. (She characterises racism as “a collective racial bias backed by legal authority and institutional control”, in which individuals and communities participate.) DiAngelo pertinently distinguishes anti-racist strategies from the valued currency of white friendliness, writing: “Niceness does not indicate a lack of racism and is not the solution to racism. Nor does a culture of niceness indicate that racism is not present in the environment.” As evidence for this assessment, she describes straight-up racial illiteracy (such as the perennially irksome “people should just see each other as humans”) from proud liberal attendees who insinuate that they are beyond a workshop on race, demonstrating how a gradation in white supremacy is nevertheless white supremacy.

                    <span>The star’s legitimate-on-paper legal battle against the world’s biggest movie studio over the streaming release of Black Widow is an inevitable next step
After heading up to the clouds to take down a nefarious brainwashing facility in the Marvel blockbuster Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson’s next target has been revealed and this time she’s striking much closer to home.
The actor announced on Thursday, via a court filing in Los Angeles, that she would be suing Disney over the release strategy of her first, and last, standalone adventure. The film had been intended for a theatrical-only debut, falling in line with her previous eight outings alongside fellow Avengers, but when Covid-19 shuttered cinemas, it jumped around the schedule before landing a now rather familiar hybrid release: simultaneously available on the big screen as well as on Disney+ for a $30 rental.

Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, has written to the home secretary following a committee visit on Tuesday when MPs saw asylum seekers held in cramped, unsafe and “completely inappropriate” facilities.

I’m not sure that I will ever stop having the exact same thought about this: “Oh my God, you can see their feet knocking together. Oh my God.”

UK-listed companies announced a combined £7.2bn in dividends and share buybacks on Thursday, as the economic rebound and receding Covid fears allowed firms to resume bumper payouts to investors.
Big oil and miners dominated the dividend bonanza, with mining firm Anglo-American revealing the largest payout, worth a total of $4.1bn, after reporting its strongest half-year profit in the company’s 104-year history. It followed similar moves by Shell, drinks company Diageo and Lloyds Banking Group, which helped round out a bumper day for shareholders.

While Biles watched and whooped from the stands, 18-year-old Sunisa Lee held her nerve in an epic four-way tussle for gold. She had already made waves by becoming the first Hmong American to compete for Team US – and then again during a nerveless performance in Tuesday night’s team competition after Biles withdrew citing anxiety concerns. This, though, was a performance bursting with energy, boldness and power.

Ministers are facing growing criticism for putting France on the new “amber plus” travel list, after concerns were raised about whether they focused too much on variant cases in its Réunion Island territory 5,700 miles (9,180 km) from Paris.
The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, admitted on Thursday the decision to impose tougher restrictions on millions of fully vaccinated French citizens and Britons holidaying or living across the Channel was partly due to the prevalence of the Beta variant on Réunion.

People in the south of England have been warned to be vigilant if wearing high-value watches or jewellery after a spate of thefts by women who approach older men.
Several expensive watches have been stolen in the car parks of golf clubs and most victims have been lone men in their 70s.

The solicitors regulator is to prosecute Mishcon de Reya, one of the UK’s most prestigious law firms, along with a former partner in its high profile sports practice.
The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) announced on Thursday that it would bring a case against the firm – known for representing Princess Diana during her divorce, and more recently the businesswoman and pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller – before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.

Foreign control of North Sea oil licences could put the UK’s plans to reach net zero emissions at risk, a study has warned.
The research shows state-backed fossil fuel companies and private equity firms are taking a tighter grip on North Sea oil, raising concerns about the government’s ability to wind down fossil fuel production and secure a “just transition” for workers.

                    <span>Benevolent dictatorship is not the answer to the region’s real problems
This week has shown that Arab regimes are tough on dissent, but much less interested in its causes. This will create problems for years to come as these states struggle to recover from the pandemic. Tunisia’s presidential power grab is a test for Joe Biden’s democracy and human rights agenda. War has impoverished ancient centres of Arab civilisation. The UN’s Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia this week pointed out that poverty now affects 88% of the population in Syria and 83% in Yemen. Even nations once considered wealthy have been brought low by an unhappy meeting of leadership failures and Covid-19. Lebanon’s leaders are begging for foreign assistance after the local currency plummeted in value and the population ran short of food, fuel and medicine.
The Arab world is a varied place. The latest UN survey shows it diverging into wealthy Gulf absolute monarchies; a set of middle-income countries with more people than their oil reserves can comfortably afford; war zones in some of the largest nations such as Iraq; and very poor states. The oil-rich sheikhdoms are pulling ahead and using their financial and military clout to extend their influence, often with disastrous results. The Arab region, says the UN, hosts more than six million refugees and more than 11 million internally displaced persons. There is little coordinated action to deal with the numerous social challenges, including growing poverty, increased unemployment and persistent gender inequalities. Food insecurity has spread. One can be too downcast: the UN hopes for a silver lining in the prospect of peace in Libya.

An independent inquiry in Malta into the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has found that the state had to bear responsibility after creating a “culture of impunity”.
The 437-page report, conducted by a team of judges and released on Thursday, said the state “failed to recognise the real and immediate risks” to the investigative journalist’s life and “failed to take reasonable steps to avoid them”.

Simone Biles stands at just 4ft 8in tall yet her presence has loomed large over gymnastics for what feels like an eternity. Since 2013, she has won the women’s all-around title every single occasion she has been present. Over time, second place had become the only realistic goal for which any other gymnast could strive.
And so, in the wake of Biles’ withdrawal from the all-around competition in Tokyo, the only question to be answered as the rest of the world marched on to the arena was how the top gymnasts would react to this new experience of having a gold medal clearly within reach.

The former Conservative education secretary Kenneth Baker has described the government’s overhaul of vocational and technical qualifications at schools and colleges in England as “an act of vandalism”.
Lord Baker, who initiated controversial school changes under Margaret Thatcher, said he opposed the Department for Education’s (DfE) plans to scrap most applied general qualifications such as BTecs in favour of its new T-levels, which will leave students aged 16 with few alternatives to A-levels. The qualification is designed to be a single two-year course focused on a specific career such as accounting, building services or hair and beauty.

I have never been a fan of porn in general, however I quite enjoyed this and have since indulged in scrolling on a few occasions, including gay sex and kissing videos. A few weeks ago, I inadvertently shared some content with my neighbour via Bluetooth. He politely informed us, we apologised and I had a laugh about it with my partner.

The experiment with electric lorries on the M180 (UK government backs scheme for motorway cables to power lorries, 27 July) is laughable when compared with the lack of interest shown by the government in furthering railway electrification at a time of an HGV driver shortage.
Just 8.5% of freight locomotives in the UK are electric. This lags lamentably behind mainland Europe, thanks in part to gaps as short as two miles in the electrified network. Aside from complete routes, there are merely 50 miles in total which, after electrification, could decarbonise over two million annual miles of freight haulage. Just 14 of these miles connect Britain’s busiest container port, Felixstowe, to the electrified network at Ipswich. The gaps exist thanks to electrified lines largely following radial passenger flows from London, whereas freight routes ignore these.

This lets men off the hook a little too lightly. Not only are they the instigators of the ruinous Industrial Revolution, which led to the vast contamination of air, water and land, but men have also spent the last 5,000 years fighting, killing, colonising, enslaving, marauding, and yelling about football.
Who invented the capitalist system that Mahdawi agrees is so destructive? And who owns the corporations she so rightly condemns? Men.

This Olympics has seen the rise of new British stars, from the likes of Tom Dean and Duncan Scott in the pool to Tom Pidcock and Georgia Taylor-Brown on a bike. But one of those who has shone brightest is someone who hasn’t actually competed.
That was not how Lutalo Muhammad originally planned it, with a third taekwondo medal in a third successive Olympics firmly in the 30-year-old’s sights before injury struck during qualification. It was a huge blow but Muhammad decided to dust himself off and take up the BBC’s offer to be a pundit for its coverage of the four days of taekwondo, working from the Olympic studio in Salford. It was a step into the unknown but one that paid off given how Muhammad performed. He was a revelation, seen most clearly in the online reaction to his punditry. Twitter, it is fair to say, blew up.

On Thursday, 31,117 cases were reported in the UK, up from 27,734 the day before, which marked the first rise in cases since 20 July.

Manchester City have stepped up their pursuit of Jack Grealish by opening negotiations with Aston Villa. The England playmaker is a key target for City, along with Tottenham’s Harry Kane, and a decision on whether a deal can be struck is expected within days.
Villa are keen to hold on to Grealish and have offered the 25-year-old a new contract. They intend to stand firm and build their team around him but their resolve will be tested if Grealish tells his boyhood club he wants to leave and City come up with a satisfactory fee. The asking price would likely be at least £100m.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has raised more than £200,000 in a single day after defending its work rescuing migrants at risk of drowning in the Channel, while volunteering inquiries have almost quadrupled.
The RNLI said it had been inundated with donations and messages of support since its chief executive hit out at Nigel Farage’s claim that it was running a “migrant taxi service”.

Bashar al-Assad has attacked a former opposition stronghold with missiles and artillery shelling in an attempt to crush a simmering insurrection, in an unprecedented development in Syria’s decade-long war.
Deraa al-Balad and its surrounds, a district of Deraa city in the southern province of the same name, was targeted with heavy weaponry in tandem with a ground push on three axes from two Syrian army divisions and allied Iran-backed militias early on Thursday morning, in a large offensive which continued throughout the day.

Renowned music agent puts Jarvis back at top table 

Oisin Murphy led a celebration party from the weighing room holding a sign that read “Smile, dance, wave and celebrate” after Lady Bowthorpe’s success in the Nassau Stakes here on Thursday, neatly summing up the mood around the winner’s enclosure after a rare Group One which managed to slip through the fingers of Flat racing’s biggest stables.
The general delight was in part for William Jarvis, Lady Bowthorpe’s trainer, who was celebrating his first top-flight win for 27 years, and also Emma Banks, agent to music stars including Kylie Minogue and Katy Perry, whose loyal support of Jarvis’s yard had finally been rewarded with a Group One success.

Civil servants made the startling admission when they refused to release private letters from the Queen’s Scottish lawyer that are thought to detail why she wanted to amend a bill dealing with green energy earlier this year.

Mercedes have accused Red Bull of a “concerted attempt to tarnish Lewis Hamilton’s good name and sporting integrity” as the Formula One war of words raged on.
Less than an hour after it emerged Red Bull had failed in their attempts to convince the FIA to review Hamilton’s 10-second penalty – following his opening-lap collision with Max Verstappen at the British Grand Prix – Mercedes hit back at their title rivals.

Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based company with no prior experience in election audits, said it had received $3.25m from Patrick Byrne, the CEO of the furniture sales company Overstock, who has falsely described the 2020 election as “rigged”, with more money pouring in from figures who have peddled lies about the legitimacy of the vote.

Staff in the arts and creative industries overtook hospitality workers as the most likely to be on furlough in June, as the number of people being paid through the UK scheme dropped by 590,000 to 1.9 million ahead of government subsidy cuts that forced employers to begin paying towards the job protection scheme.
HMRC figures showed that the number of workers on the scheme dropped from 2.5 million to 1.9 million, its lowest level since the start of the Covid pandemic, before a 10% cut in the subsidy to employers at the start of July.

In 2002, as the Scottish parliament was debating a bill to provide the public with a groundbreaking new right to roam, the independent MSP Dennis Canavan spotted a provision that exempted the Queen’s private Balmoral estate from this statutory right. Canavan managed to remove this exemption – but why had ministers ever drafted it in the first place? Did walkers climbing popular hills such as Lochnagar not deserve the same rights as those climbing every other hill in Scotland?
Since then, as the Guardian revealed this week, other acts of the Scottish parliament have exempted the Queen’s personal estates from laws that apply to every other landowner in Scotland. At least 67 Scottish parliamentary bills have been vetted by the Queen over the last two decades, including legislation around planning laws, protections from tenants and property taxation.

Invasive species such as the grey squirrel, Japanese knotweed and the European rabbit have cost the UK economy at least £5bn since the mid 1970s, according to research.
Ecosystem-altering plants and animals that wipe out native wildlife, often introduced by humans, have cost the country at least £122m a year on average since 1976, causing structural damage to buildings, clogging waterways and ruining crops.

Instead, they threatened her and her husband. “These men can do anything. They can even kill us,” the victim says to the reporter, Meera, who is filming on her smartphone. As Meera leaves, the woman’s husband tells her that she is their only hope. “We don’t trust anyone except Khabar Lahariya.”

The number of downloads of the NHS Covid-19 app has shrunk dramatically amid a “pingdemic” that is causing shortages of goods and workers, after former health secretary Jeremy Hunt warned last week that the government “risks losing social consent” for its test-and-trace programme if it does not allow fully vaccinated people to avoid isolation.
There were 43% fewer downloads of the NHS Covid-19 app in the week ending 30 June compared with the week ending 14 June, government data shows, while a record 689,313 people in England and Wales were contacted by the app and asked to self-isolate in the week to 12 July.

                    <span>The reality show is highly problematic, and attracts viewer complaints of all stripes. But one TV show can’t – and won’t – get to the root of bigger issues plaguing society
For just over a month now, Love Island (and therefore, Love Island discourse) has dominated the summer. Not since Take Me Out’s 2010s reign has a British reality dating show generated so much conversation, alternately heralded as the best thing on telly and condemned as the most controversial. As predictable as the fast fashion collaborations are the complaints, whether it be Tweeters drawing up petitions or viewers escalating their grumbles to Ofcom.
It goes without saying that Love Island, like any other reality show, is problematic. To date, the most complained about episode is from season four, when fan favourite Dani Dyer sobbed as she learned that the ex-girlfriend of her love interest Jack Fincham had joined the show. Ofcom received more than 2,500 complaints and the show was accused of “emotional manipulation”. And this week, after two years of forgoing the infamous postcard that caused such distress, it was brought back to spice up what has been a largely uneventful series. Producers showed images of castmate Teddy Soares kissing another woman during a challenge, despite spending most of his time in Casa Amor pining after Faye Winters. Watching Faye put her walls up once again, faced with the misrepresentation of his behaviour, was infuriating rather than entertaining.

                    <span>This astonishing athlete’s greatest triumph may be to make us confront the mental demands our culture puts on athletes
Simone Biles has given us many groundbreaking performances. This week she has pushed the boundaries of sport once more. Not by expanding her already extraordinary technical expertise as a gymnast but by challenging the persistent, macho narrative around what Olympic success and sporting strength should look like.
Biles follows tennis players Naomi Osaka at the French Open and Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon, who are unafraid to speak up in the global spotlight and place mental heath on the same level as physical health. Sadly, all have had their integrity, sporting prowess and character questioned. Michael Phelps revealed the extraordinary pressures and mental health struggles that he faced in a recent documentary called The Weight of Gold: the title says it all. Amid the stacks of gold medals and trophies, it’s hard to dismiss Phelps, Osaka or Biles as “weak losers” (unless you’re a certain brand of tabloid commentator). That means we have to think again. Surely we have had enough warning shots to realise the scale of the mental health crisis in sport – one that is also a mirror for wider society. It’s going to take more than a few extra wellbeing advisers to address the issue.

                    <span>Analysis: Xi Jinping wants his country to appear more lovable, but critics say Beijing’s efforts are too superficial
China’s appointment of a new ambassador to the US has shone a light on the ongoing debate among analysts about how Beijing communicates with its biggest competitor, the future of its “wolf warrior” diplomacy and how Xi Jinping’s call to “tell a good China story” might work in practice.
The debate over the “wolf warrior” style – under which, as the Chinese ambassador to Sweden said on Swedish public radio in 2019, “we treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns” – comes amid a burst of positive publicity that delighted Beijing’s propaganda officials: the foreign coverage of the herd of 15 wandering Asian elephants in southern China that captured the country’s imagination and led Chinese vloggers to travel hundreds of miles to take selfies with them.

A Syrian doctor has been charged in Germany with crimes against humanity for allegedly torturing people in military hospitals in his homeland and killing one of them, German federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.
The federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe said in a statement that Alla Mousa, who came to Germany in 2015 and practised medicine before he was arrested last year, was accused of 18 counts of torturing people in military hospitals in the Syrian cities of Homs and Damascus. The allegations include charges that Mousa tried to make people infertile.

With all the fanfare Covid would allow, the global education summit opened in London this week. Ahead of the meeting, the minister for European neighbourhood and the Americas was on rousing form. “Educating girls is a gamechanger,” Wendy Morton said, going on to describe what a plan would look like to do just that. 
The UK, co-hosting the summit with Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, plans to raise funds for the Global Partnership for Education, from governments and donors. The UK government has promised £430m over the next five years.

“It was absolutely nerve-racking,” said Stanning, whose own son was born two weeks after Glover (who already had a young son) gave birth to twins in January 2020, and who hung up her oars after the pair’s Rio triumph.

The world is witnessing the emergence of more infectious variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, but a stuttering race to ensure equitable access to vaccines has seen a handful of countries streak ahead, immunising their own populations, leaving many of the world’s vulnerable people in their wake.
Communities are struggling with impatience and fatigue, which is understandable. However, easing basic public health measures such as wearing masks and social distancing risks fuelling transmission. In combination with more infectious variants and the “me first” attitude of some countries, people who are unvaccinated and those who have received only one dose are at increasing risk.

The Glasgow-born 24-year-old, an individual silver medallist in the 200m freestyle on Tuesday, could have been forgiven if all the action and excitement prompted a dip in performance. But that is exactly what he works to avoid.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed the decision, saying there was “something uniquely powerful about locating a memorial to the Holocaust right next to the centre of the UK’s democracy”.

Hege Riise spoke of the importance of managing the mental toll tournament football can take on players and described her whirlwind management of Team GB as a “privilege” as she readied her squad to face Australia in the quarter-finals of the Olympics.
The former Norway midfielder – who won Olympic gold in 2000, the World Cup in 1995 and the Euros in 1993 and was an assistant coach with the US women’s national team from 2009 to 2012 – joined the England setup as a temporary assistant coach alongside the Canada international Rhian Wilkinson in January. With Phil Neville parting ways with the Football Association to become manager of Inter Miami shortly afterwards, Riise stepped up as interim England manager and then the FA turned to her to lead Team GB in Japan with Wilkinson as her No 2.

This does not simply mean the number of food banks has grown in recent years – there are now more than 1,300 such places in the Trussell Trust’s network, compared to fewer than 100 in 2010, as well as hundreds more independent ones – but also that these have opened the door for other types of donation centres, each set up by community groups and charities in response to growing need.

The video keeps getting removed from YouTube, but whenever it does, someone else uploads it again: jerky cameraphone footage of a man in a homemade T-shirt that reads Jesus Loves UK Garage, DJing at an Essex club in 2003. The crowd in Romford are going insane – the man is Todd Edwards, an American house producer whose rough-edged production style had exerted so much influence on the UK garage scene that he had become known as Todd the God – but the object of their worship looks, as he puts it now, “scared to death”: the smile on his face is weirdly fixed and unmoving, in a way that suggests not enjoyment, but terror.
He had, he explains today, never really DJ’d in a club before, certainly not in front of 1,500 people. Edwards had previously declined all entreaties to come to the UK, despite the fact that his music was vastly better known and more successful here than back home. Moreover, he had almost no idea what a UK garage club was like. His experience of clubbing had largely involved hanging around the booth at New York’s Sound Factory Bar, hoping that the resident DJ Little Louie Vega would play one of his tracks; a visit to Zanzibar, the Newark club where Tony Humphries had pioneered the original, gospel-influenced, American garage sound, had ended in disaster when Edwards’ car had been towed away.

Erasmus claims referee Nic Berry favoured Lions’ captain

World Rugby is under pressure to intervene after Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s director of rugby, launched another stinging attack on the refereeing of the opening Test of the British &amp; Irish Lions series. Erasmus has also offered to step aside from the remaining two Tests if it delivers “fairer” treatment for the Springboks in Saturday’s second Test.
During an hour-long video containing 26 clips highlighting a range of decisions, Erasmus suggested the Australian referee, Nic Berry, and his assistants made several crucial mistakes which significantly influenced his side’s 22-17 defeat. He also raised eyebrows by alleging his World Cup-winning captain, Siya Kolisi, was shown less respect at key moments than his Lions counterpart, Alun Wyn Jones.

“I once took a potato ricer with me to make mashed potato,” remembers Tommy Banks, chef-director of Yorkshire’s The Black Swan at Oldstead, Made in Oldstead and Roots. On coordinating its safe return after leaving it behind, his hosts asked him: “Who on earth takes a potato ricer with them on holiday?” A fair point, though self-catering kitchens can be strange places, where sweetcorn skewers are deemed essential while spatulas are MIA or relegated to a drawer you’ll most likely discover on the last day.
“When I’m cooking, I like to have certain things to hand,” says Roberta Hall-McCarron, chef-owner of The Little Chartroom in Edinburgh. “Packing everything up is a pain, but it will be better when you get there.” For Banks, that means a good knife and a decent frying pan: “There’s nothing worse than a paper-thin pan that’s going to burn everything,” he says. Maybe even more crucial, however, are a few basic ingredients: oil, salt and stock, say. Essentially, plan your meals ahead and equip accordingly.

Bette Davis was on her final stretch in this Agatha Christie vehicle, with a gallery of A-listers phoning in a souped-up version of their existing screen personae. The scene is a 1930s paddle steamer chugging down the Nile, aboard which a wealthy heiress has been shot: Peter Ustinov’s Hercule Poirot investigates and suspicion falls on a querulous American, Mrs Van Schuyler, played by Davis, who may have wanted to get her gnarled hands on the victim’s pearl necklace.

                    <span>With the bassist’s death, one of rock’s great partnerships – where raunch met ranch in absurdist but progressive American music – has come to an end
• ZZ Top bassist Dusty Hill dies aged 72
Dusty Hill was evidently used to being mistaken for someone else. Well, for one other person. In 2012, backstage at a strange festival in Maryland, I watched as drunk twentysomethings walked up to a man with a vast beard, eyes hidden behind shades. “Billy!” they shouted. “Billy, can I get a photo with you?” But Dusty Hill clearly didn’t like being mistaken for Billy Gibbons, who stood a few feet away from him on stage with ZZ Top for more than 50 years, and he walked away without a word.
Gibbons tended to be the focus of attention: he was the guitarist; he took most of the lead vocals; he was the band’s great and delightful eccentric. But Hill, who died in his sleep aged 72, was just as important. He sang lead or co-lead on several of ZZ Top’s best loved songs – his high, true tenor a contrast to Gibbons’ radioactive growl – and his bass tone was every bit as crucial to their sound as Gibbons’ guitar. And, perhaps even more importantly, the pair came as a double act, not just by looking so similar they could be mistaken for one another but also in the perfect, minimalist choreography of their stage show (“Low energy, high impact,” as Hill described it to me, later that afternoon in Maryland).

The government is using the threat of domestic vaccine passports to coax and cajole people into getting fully vaccinated, the foreign secretary has admitted.
Dominic Raab said ministers did not want to “hold the country back” just because some individuals were not coming forward to get inoculated, confirming publicly what many suspected about Boris Johnson’s sudden decision to throw his weight behind certification for nightclubs.

Dominic Cummings personally called a former colleague on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign and asked if his company would work for the government on its response to the Covid pandemic, leading to the award of a £580,000 Cabinet Office contract with no competitive process.
In an email on 20 March 2020, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser asked the most senior civil servant responsible for contracts to sign off the budget immediately, and that if “anybody in CABOFF [the Cabinet Office] whines”, to tell them Cummings had “ordered it” from the prime minister.

When, more than a decade ago, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, I turned to the internet to learn more about my condition.
Back then, the effects of trauma weren’t exactly unknown, but they weren’t making headlines, either. Most of the information I found was on psychology websites, but it wasn’t until I went to the doctor and received my diagnosis that I fully understood what was happening to me. Public awareness of the condition was low – or at least, it wasn’t something that people spoke openly about. I felt very alone.

                    <span>The inflammatory condition causes swelling of the limbs and affects more people in the UK than Parkinson’s or MS. For years it has been overlooked, but now awareness is finally growing
Five weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer, Corinne Singleton was declared to be in remission. She skipped out of the oncology ward that day, ready to make the most of her retirement. Little did she know that her health challenges were far from over. “To be honest,” says Singleton, five years later, “the cancer was a breeze compared with the lymphoedema.”
About a month into her recovery, Singleton, 60, noticed some unusual swelling of her upper thigh. “I just thought I must have banged it,” she says. When it persisted after two weeks, she realised, with a sinking feeling, what was the likely cause. She had learned about lymphoedema early on in her treatment for cancer, as a possible side effect of radiotherapy. “I remembered thinking: ‘I hope I don’t get that one’,” she says.

The lifestyles of around three average Americans will create enough planet-heating emissions to kill one person, and the emissions from a single coal-fired power plant are likely to result in more than 900 deaths, according to the first analysis to calculate the mortal cost of carbon emissions.
The new research builds upon what is known as the “social cost of carbon”, a monetary figure placed upon the damage caused by each ton of carbon dioxide emissions, by assigning an expected death toll from the emissions that cause the climate crisis.

                    <span>Photographer Maroussia Mbaye spoke to women who said crushing social stigma, poverty and lack of traditional support systems had left them with no choice but to commit infanticide
Mbeubeuss is one of the biggest rubbish tips in Africa and Senegal’s largest open cemetery for murdered children. In the past three years, the bodies of 32 infants have been recovered from the site by the waste-pickers who work there.
Looking at the high rate of infanticide in Senegal, it seems the main reasons for it are shame about pregnancy outside marriage and a loss of traditional support for young women.

                    <span>With Finland now open to vaccinated travellers, the 20,000 pristine islands off its south-west coast make for an appealing post-pandemic tour
Finland has dealt with the pandemic much better than a lot of other countries. It still has one of the lowest rates of both confirmed cases (about 103,851 at time of writing) and coronavirus-related deaths (currently 982) in Europe, a feat many have attributed to a strategy of rapid lockdowns and stringent travel restrictions.
It did all this in typical Finnish style: without shouting about it. Perhaps this quiet demeanour is related to the country’s deep connection with the natural world, where shouting usually isn’t necessary. More than 90% of Finland is either forest or water, and the country’s jokamiehenoikeus (right to roam) gives anyone living in or visiting Finland access to all that nature, including a lot of privately owned land.

“This photo project is something I’m really drawn to because of my relationship with my dad,” says Nigerian-British photographer and director Renee Osubu. Her father passed away in 2017, while she was shooting her debut film Dear Philadelphia. “This is my most vulnerable project because it’s specifically about a relationship and a person I miss. It felt like an honour to be able to spend time with all these different dads.” Though documenting children and other sensitive social groups is nothing new to Osubu, Fathers &amp; Figures is her most honest series to date.

                    <span>If cellular agriculture is going to improve on the industrial system it is displacing, it needs to grow without passing the cost on to workers, consumers and the environment
Americans will eat about 2bn chicken nuggets this year, give or take a few hundred million. This deep-fried staple is a way of profiting off the bits that are left after the breast, legs and wings are lopped off the 9 billion or so factory-farmed chickens slaughtered in the US every year. Like much else that is ubiquitous in contemporary life, the production of nuggets is controlled by a small group of massive companies that are responsible for a litany of social and ecological harms. And, like many of the commodities produced by this system, they are of dubious quality, cheap, appealing and easy to consume. Nuggets are not even primarily meat, but mostly fat and assorted viscera – including epithelium, bone, nerve and connective tissue – made palatable through ultra-processing. As the political economists Raj Patel and Jason Moore have argued, they are a homogenised, bite-size avatar of how capitalism extracts as much value as possible from human and nonhuman life and labour.
But if chicken nuggets are emblematic of modern capitalism, then they are ripe for disruption. Perhaps their most promising challenger is a radically different sort of meat: edible tissue grown in vitro from animal stem cells, a process called cellular agriculture. The sales pitch for the technology is classic Silicon Valley: unseat an obsolete technology – in this case, animals – and do well by doing good.

                    <span>The successful campaign to keep the Great Barrier Reef off Unesco’s ‘in danger’ list has been greeted with dismay – and gloom about the reef’s chance of recovery. Graham Readfearn explains the fierce global effort to deny the impact of the climate crisis on a prized natural asset. This episode includes explicit language
The Great Barrier Reef is a habitat where global heating is not some far-off threat but a present-day catastrophe. Home to extraordinary biodiversity, it is about the size of Italy or Japan – and it has suffered three mass coral bleaching events since 2015, killing up to 50% of its shallow water coral, as a result of the climate crisis, with no reprieve from that process in sight.
That conclusion, supported by a wide scientific consensus, prompted a push to have Unesco, the UN’s science and culture organisation, to add the reef to its “in danger” list. It would have been the first time a world heritage site had been placed on the list primarily because of the effects of global heating. But last week the 21-country World Heritage Committee ignored Unesco’s scientific assessment and voted to reconsider the matter next year instead.

It’s a hell of a battle for gold. Germany go ahead before Ireland fight back and they’re too strong in the final 100m as the Germans fade. Italy have bronze but Ireland have their first gold of the Olympics! They’re are the men’s lightweight double sculls champions (that’s a bit of a mouthful, but a glorious one).

Extremes of weather will strike the UK more frequently owing to the climate crisis, scientists said after data showed that last year was one of the warmest, as well as one of the wettest and sunniest, on record.
Last year was the first to figure in the top 10 for heat, rain and hours of sunshine, in records stretching back more than a century, as moderate British weather is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, according to a report from the Met Office and climate scientists.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Doctors are warning that general practice clinics risk cracking under the pressure of “unsustainable” workloads unless the government ramps up the recruitment of medical staff and takes steps to reduce burnout.
The Royal College of GPs is calling on the government to introduce an emergency rescue package to shore up general practice clinics after the pandemic, including recruiting 6,000 more GPs and 26,000 additional support staff, such as nurses and receptionists, by 2024 as well as reducing paperwork and investing in £1bn worth of improvements to infrastructure and technology. Without these changes, patients will not receive the care they need, the college said.

Having kicked off Nostimo, her restaurant in southern Seoul, during the coronavirus pandemic, Park has had to work harder to attract customers who were reluctant to eat out during a public health crisis, while complying with an evolving set of social distancing mandates that dictate how many diners she can host and when she can open her doors.

The number of cars rolling off UK production lines last month slumped to the lowest June level in almost 70 years, as car manufacturers were hit by shortages of both staff and semiconductors.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said just over 69,000 cars were produced in UK car plants last month, the lowest June total since 1953, although this excludes June 2020 when factories were slowly getting back up to speed after the first lockdown.

Alexandra Burke, Jason Donovan and Technicolor coat-wearer Jac Yarrow are among a cast whose performances ooze personality and mischief
While Andrew Lloyd Webber bumpily steers his latest £6m production into being, there is this smooth operator of a show from his musical archive. Together with Tim Rice’s lyrics, it fashions strong material from an age-old story – with its music at least.
The cast here is a winning one too, under the direction of Laurence Connor. Enlisting Alexandra Burke as the Narrator (she doubles up in other parts too) ensures a strong musical delivery from her central role, but she brings plenty besides her voice, from silky movements to minx-like touches. The only odd note is her costume – shiny leggings, sparkly trainers and high ponytail, which give her the look of an aerobics instructor.

In a statement on Liverpool football club’s website announcing the news, Devine’s family, who have cared for him ever since he suffered the devastating crushing injuries at Hillsborough, said they welcomed the coroner’s ruling.

Sometimes it is simply about points, rather than performances. It would have been unreasonable to expect too much from Warrington here given that they have had just two training sessions since their last game more than three weeks ago, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak that has ravaged their first-team squad.
But while this was not a polished performance by any stretch of the imagination, it was one filled with resilience and spirit, two traits which could yet take Steve Price’s side a long way in this season’s title race. They remain adrift of the two leading clubs, Catalans and St Helens, but results like these could prove pivotal in securing as favourable a position as possible in the top six later this summer.

Celtic missed out on the group stages for a fourth year running as a 2-1 extra-time defeat by Midtjylland consigned them to a 3-2 aggregate loss and a Europa League qualifier against Czech side Jablonec.
Celtic have made five summer signings but two of them are in quarantine and another two, young former Sheffield Wednesday pair Osaze Urhoghide and Liam Shaw, did not get off the bench in Denmark. The only new arrival to feature was 19-year-old Liel Abada, who could not build on his goalscoring debut in a quiet display.

                    <span>High court allows Greenpeace UK and others to seek judicial review of support for fossil fuel industry
The government will face a legal challenge over its continuing support for North Sea oil and gas production despite its legally binding target to end the UK’s contribution to the climate crisis.
The high court agreed on Wednesday to allow a judicial review against the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), which set out a strategy earlier this year to continue to encourage the production of North Sea oil and gas while moving to a net zero carbon future.

Scientists have successfully wiped out a population of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes by using a radical form of genetic engineering to render the females infertile – in the most advanced and largest ever test of use of the technology to fight the disease.
As well as bringing fresh hope in the fight against one of the world’s biggest killers, the study lays the foundations for further trials of gene-drive technology, which could mean self-destroying mosquitoes being released into the wild within 10 years.

Simone Biles almost never misses her Amanar vault. There are numerous times when she has peeled off during uneven-bar routines, when her landings on floor have contained steps the size of canyons and, certainly, when she has wanted to take a saw to the balance beam and split it in half. But the Amanar, as dangerous and difficult as it is, always has been one of her most trusty skills.
So when she completely lost her way in the middle of its two and a half twists during the women’s team final at the Tokyo Games, it was clear something beyond the ordinary was wrong.

                    <span>Female competitors come very close to equality at the games. But Tokyo still highlights ongoing sexism and discrimination
Strength, resilience and determination make sportswomen champions in the field. The same qualities are ensuring that more of them get there. Banned from the first modern Olympics, in 1896, only 22 competed among almost 1,000 athletes at the next games in Paris. This year Britain, the US and China have all sent more women than men to Tokyo, and overall, the number of female competitors has almost reached parity with male at last, at 48.8%.
The Games are a rare sporting realm in which women come very close to equality. Most gold medallists will receive the same financial reward from their country whether male or female. Over the years, female Olympians such as Nadia Comăneci and Jackie Joyner-Kersee have enjoyed instant name recognition and drawn spectators, just as male athletes have. Women’s events are valued in their own right.

                    <span>The RNLI has moral justice on its side when reasserting its humanitarian mission to provide sea rescue without discrimination
Viewed from Downing Street, the problem of migrant boats crossing the Channel involves a conflict between a humanitarian obligation and political pressure for closed borders. But at sea level there is no dilemma. Once people have already taken to the water and found themselves in difficulty, politics yields to ethics and the duty to save lives.
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution is a historic embodiment of that ethos. Its volunteer mariners do not interrogate the motives that led people to the sea before fishing them out. Nor should they. The RNLI’s founding mission is to help without discrimination, and it has made clear that it will not adapt that code to satisfy political frustrations at the volume of migrants attempting entry to Britain by boat. That traffic (though far lower than elsewhere) has, inevitably, meant lifeboat crews sometimes stepping in where the coastguard has not reached imperilled vessels. Those cases account for as many as half of the RNLI’s Channel launches.

I can hardly do a proper cartwheel, so I’m hesitant to opine on Simone Biles’s decision to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympics this week, telling the press and the world: “I have to focus on my mental health.” I can’t stay silent, though, because I know she’s not alone.
As a former college football player, I can imagine the psychological price Olympians pay to squeeze every ounce of greatness into a tiny window of life. As a Black man raised by a cadre of women, I can imagine the tax Black women pay because of our national commitment to “trust” them, which really just means “let them do all the work.” Or, in the case of Simone Biles, “let her put the whole country on her back”.

Fin-to-fin synchronised swimming, thought likely to be part of courtship, has been seen in groups of basking sharks for the first time. Video cameras attached temporarily to the sharks gave scientists an unprecedented view of their hitherto secret underwater world.
The gentle giants are usually solitary creatures and virtually nothing is known about their breeding behaviour. The researchers also recorded one shark shooting out above the water, the first time a full breaching has been captured from the shark’s point of view. This may also be part of wooing a mate, perhaps by showing off the fish’s size.

I have long thought that incompetence was not a credible explanation for the government’s more extreme actions during the pandemic, so I welcome the article by two sociologists, Jana Bacevic and Linsey McGoey, which says that the government constructed a facade of incompetence, behind which it could manipulate events (The British government’s Covid strategy was never designed to manage the virus, 27 July). In particular, it initially refused the help of existing public health expertise in test and trace while liaising with Serco, Deloitte and others to set up a system (branded “NHS”) that channelled huge amounts of public money to private firms. This “illusion of incompetence” continues to allow the government to avoid responsibility for mismanaging the pandemic, while benefiting its cronies financially. The fact that the government is often in fact incompetent helps, of course, to foster the illusion.

• Jana Bacevic and Linsey McGoey describe Dido Harding’s response to the spread of the virus and her argument that no one could have predicted that it would mutate, and therefore no one could be held responsible for the surge of infections. If Dido Harding had read Pale Rider, Laura Spinney’s account of the 1919 flu epidemic, published to coincide with the centenary, she would have known that in its second wave that virus killed mainly young people, having mutated from one that killed mainly older people. Yet again, those who do not take any lessons from the past are condemned to repeat it.

Surprise step up for Juddmonte International Stakes possible

Just three trainers have won the British Flat racing championship for the first time in the past 25 years, but there is increasing chance that another chair will be required at the sport’s top table after Andrew Balding’s filly Alcohol Free stormed past Poetic Flare, the favourite, in the final furlong to win the Group One Sussex Stakes here on Wednesday.
Balding is enjoying his best season since taking over the licence at from his father, Ian, in 2003, at the famous Kingsclere Stables near Watership Down where Mill Reef was prepared to win the Derby and Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in 1971. That was the season in which Ian Balding won his only trainers’ title. Half a century later his son is now neck-and-neck with Charlie Appleby at the top of the table having banked just over half a million pounds with this success on Wednesday.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Ministers have announced that fully vaccinated travellers living in the EU and the US will no longer have to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival in England from an amber country.
Under the new rules, which take effect from 4am on Monday, such travellers will still need to test negative before departure and within two days of arrival, but will not have to take a test on day eight. Three Guardian readers explain how the easing of travel restrictions affects their plans.

If anyone needed convincing that the pandemic would turbo-charge sales at America’s largest tech firms and send profits soaring, this week’s quarterly results defied the doubters.
Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have reported profits for the most recent three-month period of such stratospheric proportions they put the banks, entertainment firms and healthcare businesses in the shade. Facebook and Amazon are poised to report their own stellar performances before the weekend.

I got asked on Twitter why the Fijian players always cry when the national anthem is played. It’s true - most of the time that happens and sometimes it’s so emotionally overwhelming it derails the performance if not kept in check. The initial reaction was to say: “Well it’s obvious isn’t it?” But, that would assume the wider public know about what it really means to all Fijians.
On Wednesday the beautiful nation of Fiji won only its second Olympic gold medal, both in the country’s national sport, rugby sevens. There are now 25 Fijians from those two teams who have won a gold medal and now become a signpost to what is possible.

Sixth- and ninth-place finishes for Britain’s all-around finalists

One of the great hopes of a home Olympics for Japan was the opportunity for the greatest male gymnast of all time, Kohei Uchimura, to receive a victorious sendoff into the night on home soil. That dream died cruelly in its swiftness; a fall on his solitary routine in the qualifying round. But over the past three days of competition, in his place the talent of a new young hope has sprouted to immediately replace him.
In his stead, Daiki Hashimoto has risen to become the Olympic men’s all-around champion at just 19 years old and after a breathless, tight final in which 0.4 pts separated the top three spots.

                    <span>Guardians of the Galaxy’s James Gunn is a good directorial fit for the humour and freaky violence of DC’s bad-guy jamboree 
DC’s new Suicide Squad movie announces itself as different from the coolly received first film from 2016 simply by adding “The” to the title, maybe sneakily trying for an unacknowledged rebrand or reboot. James Gunn, also in charge of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, is brought on board as director and co-writer. This second Squad outing (if you don’t count last year’s standalone Harley Quinn adventure Birds of Prey) is a long, loud, often enjoyable and amusing film that blitzes your eyeballs and eardrums and covers all the bases. There is Guardians-style comedy mixing humans and talking animals, there is freaky violence – including what I have to say is a gruesomely impressive interior-anatomical shot, showing a knife plunging into the still-beating heart – and there is colossal CGI spectacle for the final act in which a giant thing runs rampant in a city, while the gang look up at it; a trope that has become almost legally mandatory for superhero movies.
Viola Davis once again brings a touch of class to the Suicide Squad franchise as the chillingly manipulative security chief Amanda Waller who now springs supervillain Bloodsport (Idris Elba) from jail so that he can head up an elite new crew of misfits, desperadoes and undesirables. These include Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the ironically belligerent Peacemaker (John Cena), King Shark – a great big talking shark in Hulk-ish stretchy shorts – voiced by Sylvester Stallone, Ratcatcher II (Daniela Melchior), who commands an army of rats wherever she goes, and Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), who fires molten polka-dots at the enemy, revving himself up for the task by imagining that this is his overbearing mother. There is also a kind of B-team of Squadders whose job is to be hilariously expendable.

A rare and ancient tablet showing part of the epic of Gilgamesh, which had been acquired by Christian arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby for display in its museum of biblical artefacts, has been seized by the US government.
The Department of Justice (DoJ) alleges that the 3,600-year-old “Gilgamesh Dream Tablet”, which originated in a region that is now part of Iraq, was acquired in 2003 by an American antiquities dealer, “encrusted with dirt and unreadable”, from the family member of a London coin dealer. Once it had arrived in the US, and been cleaned, experts realised that it showed a portion of the Gilgamesh epic, one of the world’s oldest works of literature, in the Akkadian language.

                    <span>It’s great to see men such as Tom Daley sobbing in victory – and the gold standard for emotional articulacy is surely showing your sadness
I am all for men crying; I do a lot of it myself. If we leave onions out of it, there are only two kinds of crying. There’s crying because you’re happy and crying because you’re sad. I would suggest the latter represents the original purpose of crying, but the former is very good, too. Tom Daley’s top-of-the-podium tears, running down his face and dampening his mask, were a joy to see. Perhaps the moisture in the air of the aquatic centre lends itself to this kind of thing, because James Guy then raised the blubbing bar by sobbing with joy at a teammate’s gold before going on to shed more water after winning his own.
This is all healthy stuff, indicating a good deal of emotional articulacy, but for me the gold standard in the sporting crying game is to bawl it out good and loud when you’ve lost, rather than won. It seems more acceptable for women to do this than it is for men. Our female taekwondists have been particularly strong on this. I felt like crying with Jade Jones when it all fell apart, and so did her teammate looking on, Bianca Walkden, who shed more tears than Jade herself. So while we had blokes crying with joy for themselves and each other, the women were brave enough to do the same in their shared despair.

The BBC has faced a lot of criticism over its Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games coverage, but one element that seems to have only attracted praise has been the reassuring and calm presence of Lutalo Muhammad giving his expertise during the taekwondo events.
As well as his soothing voice, Muhammad has been happy to demonstrate some of his moves in the BBC’s virtual studio, while also noting that he’d have to be careful not to split his trousers while executing the high kicks, much to the amusement of his co-presenters.

                    <span>Rank-and-file officers facing a pay cut in real terms have had enough of empty praise and hollow promises
Last Thursday, the Police Federation passed a vote of no confidence in the home secretary after the announcement that rank-and-file officers in England and Wales would receive a 0% pay increase – a real-terms cut after 18 months on the frontline of the pandemic. On Monday, new figures revealed a mental health crisis plaguing rank-and-file officers. Now, with the announcement of a “crime-beating plan” that offers little support for officers, but plenty of gimmicks with which to pepper political speeches, the relationship between the force and the government is at risk of being severed beyond repair.
The police should not be above criticism; their mistakes have been numerous, and the implications on public trust profound. It is important to acknowledge where policing has failed, and whom it has failed. And I say that not as an armchair pundit, but as a former chief superintendent and a staunch supporter of rank-and-file officers.

                    <span>Defender has sights set on a place back in the Champions League and admits last season’s toils caused real lows around the squad
Until the last possible moment, Rob Holding held out a sliver of hope that the most gruelling of years might yet be extended further. Anyone grasping for positives from Arsenal’s season might have cited his increasingly consistent, mature performances at the heart of their defence but they were not enough to earn a first senior England call-up for Euro 2020. “When the squads were being announced I had my eye on it,” he says. “You never know, so I was looking. It didn’t happen for me this time but that’s not going to deter me or make me feel it’s never going to.”
Arsenal’s defensive record in 2020-21 was bettered only by Manchester City and Chelsea, although that was never going to offer much succour after a campaign of such barren reward. If it could not exactly be described as a breakthrough year for Holding, it was certainly a progression. He had never quite nailed down a regular spot, a situation not helped by anterior cruciate ligament surgery late in 2018, and appeared likely to depart on loan last autumn. But he convinced Mikel Arteta enough to give him 39 starts, 30 in the league, and a new contract in January suggested little appetite from either party to move on.

HSBC discovered a suspected money laundering network that received $4.2bn (£3bn) worth of payments, it has emerged, raising questions over whether it disclosed the information to US monitors who at the time were ensuring the bank cleaned up its act. 
Insiders who spoke to journalists as part of a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, have suggested that HSBC may not have appropriately shared the information with the monitoring team installed by US regulators in 2012 after HSBC allowed drug cartels in Latin America to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through its accounts.

Speaking on the first morning of a preliminary hearing of a high court libel claim against a bestselling book about the modern Kremlin, Hugh Tomlinson QC said the 54-year-old billionaire did not “bring this claim lightly” and understood it could be characterised as “an attack on public interest journalism”.

The date was 10 February 2007 and the air was cold. Barack Obama, a US senator without deep political experience, stood before the old state capitol in Springfield, Illinois, where Abraham Lincoln began his career, and announced his daring candidacy for president of the United States.
But on that same day, a State of the Black Union conference was taking place in Virginia. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, told the gathering: “I wish Obama had announced here ’cos Lincoln did not free us. The abolitionist movement freed us. We’ve got to quit giving the wrong people credit for our history.”

sprouted mung beans 100g
carrot 1 medium-sized
brown rice noodles 100g
cucumber 1 medium-sized
coriander a large handful

The ancient Palestinian village of Lifta sits on a quiet hillside minutes from Jerusalem’s bustling modern centre. Abandoned when its residents fled during the 1948 war, it has been left unchanged – frozen in time – ever since.
Today, however, its overgrown domed stone houses with arched windows, built during the early Ottoman Empire and resting on even older ruins dating back to the Iron Age, are at risk of being demolished to make way for a luxurious resort of villas, hotels and shops.

Ten years after the revolution that triggered the Arab spring, Tunisia, long regarded as one of the few democratic transition success stories to come out of that era, has been plunged into crisis after its president, Kais Saied, suspended parliament and lifted the immunity of politicians for 30 days, citing a provision in Tunisia’s 2014 post-revolution constitution.
That has prompted accusations from Ennahda, often described as a moderate Islamist party, that Saied has staged a coup.

Myanmar is at risk of becoming a super-spreader Covid state that fuels outbreaks across the region, the UN special rapporteur for the country has warned as he urged the security council to call for a ceasefire.
The south-east Asian country is facing its most severe outbreak yet, on top of a deep political and economic crisis brought about by the military coup in February. Its vaccination programme has ground to a standstill, testing has collapsed, and government hospitals are barely functioning.

                    <span>Many of us are holidaying close to home this year and opting for camping, having never tried it before. Readers recall the cold, wet, wild and wonderful experiences they have had under canvas
After 18 months of lockdown and seeing nothing but buildings and city life, I needed to get away. I’d dreamed of visiting the Outer Hebrides for years and decided to take the plunge in May 2021, walking and camping solo along the Hebridean Way – my first time camping as an adult. I woke up to stunning beach views and I loved the freedom. But it wasn’t always easy: some nights I had to hold my tent up against the winds at 3am, and carrying all my kit on my back was horrendous at times. But I wouldn’t change a thing. My aim for the trip was to get back in touch with my homeland and endure the camping – but it turns out I love camping! It won’t be long before I’m on my way back to the Outer Hebrides – but with a lighter rucksack and a better inflatable mat this time. Bev Mackenzie, freelance copywriter, Bristol

The Queen’s lawyers secretly lobbied Scottish ministers to change a draft law to exempt her private land from a major initiative to cut carbon emissions, documents reveal.
The exemption means the Queen, one of the largest landowners in Scotland, is the only person in the country not required to facilitate the construction of pipelines to heat buildings using renewable energy.

In the mountains of Guerrero in south-west Mexico, there is a small town called Alcozacán. Violence is common in the area, which is strategically important for the drug trade. Violence has increased all over Mexico over the past few years, but some places including Guerrero have been particularly badly affected.
The people of Alcozacán and its surrounding towns became more and more angry about the criminal groups terrorising their communities and what they saw as a lack of protection from the government. They felt abandoned, so formed community defence forces to protect themselves from the gangs and drug traffickers. In Alcozacán, there are no police as we know them. It is ruled – or taken care of, depending on your point of view – by a force made up of local people.

Charlotte Dujardin has cemented her place in the history books as the most decorated British female Olympian of all time, winning a bronze in the individual dressage – the double champion’s sixth Olympic medal.
Dujardin and her horse Gio, riding together in their first Olympics, danced their way to legendary status in the grand prix freestyle at Tokyo Equestrian Park, with Dujardin having won gold at London 2012 and in Rio 2016 on her horse Valegro.

                    <span>Writers from Alice Munro to JD Salinger capture the restless ennui and dangerous passions of the do-nothing years before adulthood sets in 
Returning to carefree adolescence might sound like an exciting and sexy proposition – parties, kissing, no hangovers, no debt – but wasn’t most of that time spent in utter boredom? Wasn’t being a teenager tedious with brief, if intense, highs? The rules, the expectations, the parents, the fact you’re not a child and not yet an adult, the constant sensation that you are always missing out on something.
As I recall, those pimply years comprised extended periods of school and do-nothing days with the occasional freezing night spent watching older lads talk to girls. But I’d argue it was within that tiresome fug that the lasting stuff occurred, and many of our treasured teenage memories resulted from nothing particularly exciting happening: bored, you did something mad with your mates. Or you did something mad to yourself. Or you sent something mad to somebody else in a hope they might feel the same. Or you let a horse into a house party.

                    <span>Tough police tactics always backfire. If the prime minister wants to cut knife crime, there are far more effective ways
Yesterday I was reminded, yet again, that a policy of “fighting crime” can quickly morph into punitive policing and an attack on civil liberties. For the record, I am not anti-police, nor am I against tackling violent crime. What I am against is racial discrimination and oppressive police practices. Here we are, a year on from the unprecedented mass mobilisation of people at Black Lives Matter protests across the UK and numerous discussions about racial disparity in the criminal justice system have taken place. Yet it is clear the government has learned nothing in the past 12 months. Absolutely zilch.

                    <span>After the tube she was commuting on was blown up, Mughal’s life changed for ever. A Muslim herself, she was horrified to hear Muslims had been behind the attack. So she quit her job and started her own programme to take on extremism
Sajda Mughal was on her daily commute to her dream job in City recruitment on the morning her world was turned upside down. It was a July day in London, 16 years ago, one that throbbed with the summer heat, and Mughal was running late for work. She ducked into Turnpike Lane tube station in north London, as she usually did, and boarded the Piccadilly Line train. The one thing she did differently that morning was not getting into the first carriage of the train. “Every day until 6 July 2005, I would sit in that first carriage. Maybe it was a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder, or maybe I knew the first carriage was where I’d get a seat. But, on that particular day, I was late, so I rushed on to the platform and, instead of doing my usual thing, I just got on.”
This detail became all-important when, a few stops later, at King’s Cross, the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay got on to Mughal’s train, boarding the first carriage, and blew himself up. “Twenty-six people died, most of whom were in the first carriage,” she says.

                    <span>The secret to an authentic taste and mouth-feel is fat, so what’s the best substitute for dairy? Our resident perfectionist tries them all …
Plant-based ice-cream, like so much else in the vegan world, has come on leaps and bounds in both range and quality in recent years as the market for it has grown, but many commercial varieties still replace dairy and eggs with a long list of perfectly harmless, yet still less than enticing ingredients such as fully refined soybean oil. Without stabilisers, the homemade kind may not last quite as well in the freezer but, frankly, it doesn’t need to: it’s unlikely to be in there long.
This recipe makes a virtue of coconut’s flavour, as well as of its natural creaminess, though you could also use it as a base for other ingredients, folding in fruit puree or chocolate chips after churning, say, or adding the likes of cocoa powder or peppermint extract to the base itself. Richer than a sorbet, lighter and cleaner than standard ice-cream, it’s really not just for vegans.

• Joey Jordison, founding Slipknot drummer, dies at age 46
To better understand the magnitude of former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison’s death at the age of 46 requires us to first recall the loss of another drummer. Praised universally for his technical wizardry and powerhouse style, Rush’s legendary Neil Peart died in January 2020 – a watershed moment for rock drumming. Eighteen months later, we now face the heavy metal equivalent.
While there’s a strong case for Slipknot as the greatest metal band of their generation, Jordison was almost definitively the finest metal drummer of his era. Born in the band’s native Des Moines, Iowa, Jordison picked up his first pair of drumsticks aged eight. He co-founded the nine-piece Slipknot in 1995 and spent 18 years behind the kit for the megastars. Slipknot developed their own lore: there were the obvious nods to horror in the terrifying face masks and boiler suits they wore for live performances, and each member was assigned their own number. Tellingly, Jordison was No 1.

Swerving off course, veering out of its lane at the last. Sport loves a metaphor. As Britain’s Olympic rowers reeled off a series of wholehearted but ultimately disappointing finishes at the Tokyo 2020 waterfront it was hard to avoid the sense the men’s coxless four had dished up their own slightly hammy, if unavoidably persuasive image in its final race.
By the end of Wednesday’s programme one thing did seem uncomfortably clear. The choice to allow Jürgen Gröbler to leave a year before these Games, a decision made by men who can only guess vaguely at Gröbler’s depth of fine-point expertise, looks as rash and as damaging now as it did at the time.

                    <span>When the pandemic wanes, bold ideas and big investment could create a new economic miracle for the 21st century
Economic history isn’t like normal history – it doesn’t repeat itself as farce and it doesn’t rhyme. Technology moves on, political and legal systems develop, debtors turn into creditors and vice versa. But some economic structures remain stubbornly the same. As Karl Marx said, we make our own history, but not in circumstances of our own choosing. Using the past to guide decisions in the present requires understanding what has endured and what has changed, and taking a sober view of our history – not simply replicating the supposed golden ages of the past.
For that reason, we shouldn’t aim to repeat the “roaring 20s” just because the decade starts with a two and we’re (hopefully) coming to the end of a pandemic similar to the Spanish flu. Despite the name, the roaring 20s were not all that great for most of the population. Growth was sluggish and the falling prices of consumer goods concealed widening inequality by making everyone feel rich, much like the decade preceding the 2008 financial crisis. In the 20th century as in the 21st, a period of growth ended in a financial crash, a lost decade, the rise of rightwing populism and leading countries turning their back on trading blocs.

                    <span>The mayor of the Norwegian capital argues that the ‘moral’ duty to cut emissions from burning waste can be met by carbon capture
The city of Oslo was built on wealth generated by the North Sea, which for decades has produced billions of barrels of oil and gas. But Oslo now hopes to lead Norway’s transformation from one of the world’s largest exporters of fossil fuels to a global green pioneer.
For Raymond Johansen, Oslo’s governing mayor, helping to lead global efforts to tackle the climate crisis is both a pragmatic economic response to Norway’s declining fossil fuel industries, and a moral obligation to provide solutions for a crisis it helped to create.

A new conservation tool could help put thousands of threatened animal and plant species on the road to recovery, allowing creatures such as the Sumatran rhino and the California condor to flourish once again.
Scientists have typically focused on monitoring how close endangered species are to extinction, regularly updating the severity of the risk on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list, which includes iconic wildlife such as the mountain gorilla and rare flowering plants such as the Bayard’s adder’s-mouth orchid.

“I knew of it from pictures I’d seen online and I thought it looked pretty, but when you arrive and see it yourself, it’s like, ‘Oh wow, this is insane,’” says actor Guido Garcia Lueches about the Minack Theatre. “It’s probably the best theatre I’ve ever performed in.”
Carved largely by hand into a craggy, granite cliff-face, the dizzying outdoor venue on the south coast of Cornwall looks magnificent in the summer sunshine. Tiers of subtropical foliage splash colour throughout the landscape and weathered concrete seats bearing the titles of past shows rise abruptly from the stage. The ocean, 100ft below, looks an enticing shade of turquoise.

                    <span>I had told my mum that I would look after Declan after her death. But standing in an airport car park, the ramifications began to rush through my head
It was in Stansted airport’s Pink Elephant car park that I realised all the adults were going home. It was early January 2007 and we had just returned from Mum’s funeral in Derry. I watched as uncles and aunts ambled over to their cars, and there the three of us were left: me, 25, my girlfriend, Jade, 26, and my little brother, Declan, who had just turned 16. I was now his legal guardian.
This moment shouldn’t have been a surprise. Mum had been ill, on and off, for eight years and, in her last 12 months, had made plans for what would happen if she didn’t make it. It was a no-brainer when she asked: “What about Declan?” “I’ll look after him,” I instantly replied.

                    <span>There’s less noise and fewer people, but a family trip to the Glastonbury site delivers enough of the festival experience to make great memories
There are some things every Glastonbury festivalgoer is guaranteed to experience. You’ll lose yourself in the endless fields and pathways (and your tent at least once). You will plot the perfect itinerary to take in your favourite artists and each area of the site, but only see a fraction of it all. And it will definitely rain.
This year, though, thanks to Covid, the Glasto experience is rather different. A mini online-only version of the festival ran in June (last year was cancelled), but owner Michael Eavis and family are welcoming people to Worthy Farm this summer by, for the first time, opening it as a campsite. For six weeks, visitors can stay in one of 750 pre-erected tents dotted across the site. There’s room for a total of 3,500 visitors at any one time – a smattering compared with the 200,000 of a festival weekend. Gone are the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, the music and the welly-stealing mud. Instead, there are resident cows (it’s a working farm), free children’s activities and a vibe so relaxed you could actually get some sleep, even with little ones.

                    <span>New petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK from 2030, and sales of electric vehicles are rising fast. But with drivers reliant on charging points how practical is the greener option? One writer finds out
Range anxiety hits hard on the A9 in the Highlands of Scotland. For the uninitiated, this is the fear that an electric vehicle (EV) won’t reach its destination before running out of power. I’m driving through some of Britain’s loveliest landscape – mountains, rivers, lochs and firths – but I hardly notice. I’m focused hard – on the road in front, but mainly on two numbers on the dashboard. One is how far it is in miles to where I’m going; the other is the range in miles remaining in the battery. Sometimes, especially on downhill stretches when what is known as “regenerative braking” means the battery is getting charged, I tell myself it’s going to be OK, I’ll make it. But going uphill the range plummets. Squeaky bum time.
Plus, I’ve read Michel Faber’s Under the Skin. I know what happens to men stranded on the A9. To range anxiety add the fear of being processed and eaten by aliens.

                    <span>It might seem like a post-Trump world, but in red states across the US his most hardline supporters are setting the political agenda. How much power do they have to shape the country’s future, even with a Democrat in the White House?
To a casual observer, Joe Biden’s victory in the last US presidential election, coupled with Democratic success in the Senate and the House, might have seemed to turn the page on the Donald Trump era and consign his hardline policy agenda to the past. But a huge amount of power in the US resides in its 50 state legislatures, and Republicans won a clear majority in 30 of them. In large parts of the US they are now using that power to enact a policy agenda that many observers view as being far more extreme than many voters would have supported. So why are they going ahead anyway?
Rachel Humphreys speaks to David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington bureau chief, about the politics that lie behind that move to the right, and how in the era of coronavirus it will further deepen the sense that there are two vastly different Americas. Smith reflects on what threat to Biden’s agenda the state Republicans will present and whether their strategy of appeasing their base could pave the way for a new Trump run at the presidency in 2024.

Plans to significantly open up international travel are expected to be announced on Wednesday, with UK ministers poised to let people who have been fully vaccinated in the US and EU avoid quarantine if arriving from amber list countries.
The move would benefit millions of people by finally letting them be reunited with family and friends based in the UK, as well as businesses in the aviation and tourism sectors that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has hit out at accusations it is operating a “migrant taxi service” by rescuing people at risk of dying in the water as they cross the Channel in small boats, which the charity says is its moral and legal duty.
Responding to accusations from Nigel Farage that it is facilitating illegal immigration, the volunteer lifeboat charity said it was “very proud” of its humanitarian work and it would continue to respond to coastguard callouts to rescue at-risk Channel migrants in line with its legal duty under international maritime law.

The 120-page strategy, led by the Department for Work and Pensions, is intended as the first step in an annual process by which all departments will be assessed on how well their policies help disabled people.

More than one in three middle-aged British adults are suffering from at least two chronic health conditions, including recurrent back problems, poor mental health, high blood pressure, diabetes and high-risk drinking, according to research that warned that health in midlife is on the decline.
The study of “generation X” adults born in 1970 found that those who grew up in poorer families were 43% more likely to have multiple long-term health conditions than their peers from wealthier households. Those who had been overweight or obese as children, who had lower birthweight and who had experienced mental ill-health as teenagers were also at increased risk of poor health in midlife.

I remember sitting in the pub many years ago with a barrister friend who had just taken part in his first court case. It involved a sexual assault. “I’m glad we were prosecuting,” he said, draining the first of many shots. “Because there’s not one bit of that that’s nice.”
And so to the latest documentary from Channel 4’s flagship current affairs strand, Dispatches, an unflinching report in which, similarly, there is not one bit that is nice. The customarily succinct and harrowing hour is titled India’s Rape Scandal and follows two of the most high-profile of the unimaginably brutal rapes that are becoming notorious in the country. One rape is reported to the police every 15 minutes in India, yet it is estimated that more than 90% of such assaults go unreported.

Employees already have the right to request flexible hours, but Labour says it would widen the definition of flexible working and give employers a legal responsibility to accommodate it unless they can show it is not workable.

The move by the justice department declined to assert executive privilege for Trump’s acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, clearing the path for other top former officials to also testify to congressional committees investigating the Capitol attack without fear of repercussions.

                    <span>PM’s attempt to grip agenda flounders amid criticism he has ignored evidence on stop-and-search
Police chiefs have condemned Boris Johnson’s high-profile strategy to tackle crime as “weird and gimmicky”, while plans to increase stop-and-search were criticised for ignoring the evidence.
The crime initiative was supposed to show the Johnson government gripping the agenda. But senior police officers, the rank and file, opposition politicians and even some in business rebuked it.

US politics – live updates

Law enforcement officers have described fearing for their lives during the January attack on the US Capitol and living with “constant trauma” during the first hearing of the House investigation into the deadly assault, with prominent Republicans boycotting proceedings in an attempt to undermine any findings.
In harrowing testimony on Tuesday, the officers described being crushed by violent pro-Trump rioters, threatened with their own service weapons, and being target by racist abuse.

Team GB have now made their greatest start to an Olympic Games in modern times after winning a fourth gold medal in four days in Tokyo. Further success in the pool, gym, taekwondo, triathlon and dressage on Tuesday pushed their tally to 13 overall – although fans were advised not to get carried away with thoughts of leaping beyond the 67 medals won at Rio 2016 quite yet.
The latest golden moment came in the form of swimmer Tom Dean winning the men’s 200m freestyle title after an epic battle with fellow Briton Duncan Scott, who claimed silver.

A former air force intelligence analyst was sentenced to 45 months in prison on Tuesday for leaking top secret information about the US government’s drone strike program to a journalist.
Daniel Hale of Nashville, Tennessee, has said he was motivated by guilt and a desire for transparency when he disclosed to an investigative reporter details of a military drone program that he believed was indiscriminately killing civilians in Afghanistan far from the battlefield.

“We all know of footballers who played cricket, but have any ever competed at the Olympics,” asks Harvey Mayne, presumably meaning in other sports.
Yes they have, Harvey – and in a variety of sports, too. We have already covered footballers at the Winter Olympics so we’re going to stick to the summer Games. Here’s Graeme Park with a former Welsh international you wouldn’t want to mess with competing in Japan on Wednesday. “I would nominate Lauren Price, who has earned international caps for Wales and won world kickboxing titles. She has already won a Commonwealth gold in boxing and is at Tokyo 2020 as the current No 1 middleweight boxer.”

                    <span>Former health minister appeared irritated at detailed questioning of his role at time of 1980s scandal
Ken Clarke has been criticised by families affected by the infected blood inquiry for displaying “contempt” in his evidence after he showed a reluctance to answer questions.
Lord Clarke, who was a Conservative health minister from 1982 to 1985 and health secretary from 1988 to 1990, appeared to become irritated with the level of detail being examined by the lead counsel, Jenni Richards QC. 
At one point, he asked: “Why do we have to go through such meticulous detail through who said what when, when did he change his mind?” He added that it was “interesting” but “pretty pointless”. 
Further protestations from Clarke led the chair of the inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, to state that it was up to him to “ultimately determine” what questions were relevant. He said: “I think the relevance ultimately, Lord Clarke, is for me to determine. If I think the questions are unhelpful, then I will indicate that. 
“But at the moment, it would be helpful to me, I think, and we may get on a little bit more quickly if we just deal with the questions as they come and leave the motive or the purpose of asking the questions to counsel.”

                    <span>Many voters think the government handles crime badly. Unworkable but tough-sounding punishments won’t change their minds.
Boris Johnson was a journalist who wanted to be prime minister. Now in Downing Street, he appears happiest when supplying headlines for the rightwing press. On Sunday, his plan to “blitz crime” was on the front page of the Sunday Express. On Monday, his home secretary was telling readers of the Daily Mail that she’ll make “yobs clean the streets”. At best, the government’s proposals are an irrelevance to tackling crime or making people feel safer. More likely, they will create perverse incentives and make a bad situation worse.
The policies fail on their own terms. Chain gangs are not a good way of deterring criminals. They have not stopped them in the US. This silly stunt will stigmatise a generation of offenders. There is good evidence that stop and search has minimal effects on crime levels, so why persist with a tactic that lowers trust levels? Tagging those released from prison might help reduce recidivism rates. But why devote resources to tagging burglars and not violent offenders?

The bonus has been publicised via a job advert posted on Tesco’s site, with the supermarket telling potential candidates: “You’ll play a vital role for our customers and communities, representing Tesco on the highways and byways of the UK.”

                    <span>Hungary’s prime minister is once again stoking the politics of division ahead of an election
In his victory speech following a third successive election triumph in 2018, Viktor Orbán told jubilant supporters that the result gave voters “the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary”. For over a decade now, Hungary’s prime minister has skilfully galvanised his political base by cultivating a siege mentality. Three years ago, Muslim migrants were depicted as the enemies at the gates, whose entry would undermine Christian values and traditions. Other targets of choice have included George Soros, NGOs and, the Guardian’s recent Pegasus revelations appear to suggest, critical journalists placed under digital surveillance.
A new election requires a new threat. As Hungary emerges from the pandemic, Mr Orbán and his Fidesz party have entered campaigning mode ahead of a spring poll that is expected to be extremely close. Their baleful gaze has alighted on Hungary’s LGBT+ population and its potential to lead the young astray. Last month, MPs passed a law that prohibits depicting or promoting LGBT+ content to under-18s in Hungary’s schools and the media. The new legislation will heavily restrict the portrayal of LGBT+ people in the arts and entertainment, and elsewhere. Critics have compared it to Russia’s 2013 law against “gay propaganda”, which was duly followed by a disturbing increase in violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

Two days after Tunisia’s stumbling democracy ground to a halt, the streets of the country’s capital were quiet, even indifferent on Tuesday, with the presence of army troops near a TV station one of the few symbols of a new and unsettling normal.
Protesters who had raged on Sunday before President Kais Saied sacked the county’s prime minister and suspended parliament were absent from sites that days before had been febrile hubs of discontent. Instead, passersby seemed to go about their business caring little about the gravity of the moment. In some parts of Tunis, the mood was almost celebratory.

Great Britain’s women’s gymnastics team shocked the sport by becoming the first since 1928 to win a medal in the Olympic team finals as they came from behind to secure bronze in dramatic fashion on Tuesday.
“I cannot believe this, this is more than a dream come true,” said Jennifer Gadirova. “My dream was to make the Olympics and experience it and even being here is an achievement in itself. Our biggest aim was to make Paris 2024. Let alone coming away with a medal. It is incredible and there are words to describe it.”

Westminster city council confirmed refunds were being given out after the project suffered “teething problems” which left its artist’s impression looking nothing like the rather limp reality – leading to a torrent of ridicule on social media.

A team of scientists will embark on a new international research project led by Harvard University to search for evidence of extraterrestrial life by looking for advanced technology it may leave behind.
The Galileo Project is led by the Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb. Loeb co-founded the project with Frank Laukien, CEO of Bruker Corporation, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of scientific equipment.

Coronavirus – latest updates

People advised to shield in the first wave of the pandemic were five times more likely to die after a confirmed Covid infection than those considered at low risk from the disease, according to research in Scotland.
The study, led by the University of Glasgow, found that efforts to shield the most vulnerable did not prevent substantial levels of infection in the most high-risk groups, with many patients succumbing to the virus.

Looking back to early pandemic times, it was probably Architectural Digest’s video tour of Dakota Johnson’s Hollywood home that nudged me down the YouTube hole of celebrity house tours.
Like many millennials my Instagram feed is at any given moment peppered with aspirational content from sites like The Design Files and a stream of homogenous pastel-hued influencers. But sitting housebound with my partner and cat in our rented, single bedroom flat, the Fifty Shades of Grey star’s whimsical tour of her tastefully-decorated mid century Hollywood home and kitchen stocked with unreasonable quantities of limes (“I love limes, they’re great and I like to present them like this in my house,” she explained) offered a welcome hit of late night escapism from the more foreboding stuff unfolding across the internet in March 2020.

Major aged care providers have warned vaccination rates for their home care staff remain extraordinarily low, just days after the government conceded it still has no specific plan for vaccinating the workforce.
About 150,000 aged care workers provide care to about 1 million older Australians in their own homes across the country, but the government revealed on Friday it still has no dedicated plan for vaccinating home care staff and has given the issue little focus.

His heartbreaking picture of a young child, emaciated and dressed in rags, was made into a poster for charity and won McGrath the photograph of the year accolade in the British press awards in 1984. The following year, Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concerts galvanised people worldwide to give tens of millions of pounds to the cause.

MOm, the Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Monk Seal, said it was offering a €18k (£15k) bounty for information, or evidence, that “will lead to the arrest of the person(s) responsible for the killing of the seal, known as Kostis”.

Trainer apologises, Aidan O’Brien’s Twinkle promoted to first

There were chaotic scenes following a two-year-old fillies’ maiden at the Galway Festival on Tuesday evening after Alizarine, apparently a 4-1 winner on debut for trainer Jessica Harrington, was disqualified when she “could not be positively identified post-race”. This, it soon transpired, was because “Alizarine” was in fact Aurora Princess, a three-year-old filly due to run in a handicap later on the card.
Harrington later apologised for the mix-up, which was discovered before a “winner all right” message – the Irish equivalent of “weighed in” – had been issued to make the result official for betting purposes. The initial placings were later revised, with Aidan O’Brien’s Twinkle, the 5-4 favourite, promoted to first place.

Tony Abbott, the former prime minister of Australia recruited by Johnson to advise on post-Brexit trade, said he was heartened by a review being launched into the takeover of Welsh microchip manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia and suggested it meant the process could be paused.

Great Britain’s Bianca Walkden said she felt “a little bit robbed” of the chance to win a silver or gold medal in taekwondo at the Olympics, saying it was “soul-crushing” to have to fight for third place.
Walkden overcame the agony of her last-second defeat in the Olympic semi-final to take bronze in the women’s +67kg category with a 7-3 victory over Poland’s Aleksandra Kowalczuk on the final day of the competition. Speaking after the fight, the 29-year-old told the BBC she believed her semi-final opponent, South Korea’s Lee Da-bin, should have been penalised for a grab before she landed her winning crescent kick in the last seconds of the fight.

Hundreds of vulnerable children in the care of Lambeth council in south London were subjected to horrendous cruelty and sexual abuse over several decades on a scale that was “hard to comprehend”, an independent inquiry report has found.
The independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) found more than 700 allegations of sexual abuse against hundreds of staff and individuals connected with just three homes in the borough. The true scale of abuse was likely to be far higher, it said.

I’ve stood on picket lines in support of junior doctors during the Jeremy Hunt years and am in total support of pay increases for all medical and non-medical NHS workers (Threat of nurses’ strike over 3% pay award for NHS staff, 21 July). Whenever pay scales are quoted, however, they invariably refer to medical pay grades and don’t highlight the harsh reality of low pay for other workers who represent the essential cogs in the NHS machine.
Along with cleaners ensuring the safety of all areas, and porters transporting seriously ill patients and taking the dead to the mortuary, there is rarely a mention of admin and clerical workers, who book clinics, liaise with sick and stressed patients when appointments are cancelled at short notice, chase up no-shows, arrange hospital transport etc.

Having read that even Big Tobacco is now apparently willing to fall on its sword for the sake of our children’s future, or whatever (Tobacco firm Philip Morris calls for ban on cigarettes within decade, 25 July), I wish to put forward that the simplest way to approach this, instead of endlessly trying to warn people off the cigs with public health campaigns, would be to ban the sale of tobacco to anyone born after 2005.
This would prevent the uptake of smoking by a new cohort of young people, while tobacco products could remain available for another decade in which existing smokers would have ample opportunity to curb their addictions. A flat cohort ban like this would also make ID checks quicker (no maths involved), and harder to falsify, as the age discrepancy of new smokers would become more obvious over time.

A seductive encounter with past and present at the Olympic city shows that Tokyo practically invented modern art


Love hotels and cross-dressers make Tokyo’s nightlife eye-popping – and that’s just in 18th-century woodblock prints. The Ashmolean’s seductive overview of the Olympic city’s art sets these classics alongside images of contemporary Tokyo to create a thrilling and informative encounter with one of the world’s great art capitals.
Past and present meet for a sultry encounter in the night. A wall is lit up by Mika Ninagawa’s intensely coloured photos of blue- and pink-haired clubbers. They are so now – yet close by in the same gallery is a painted scroll from the 1600s that is just as provocative. It depicts the pleasure quarter of Edo, as Tokyo was then called, which became Japan’s capital when the Tokugawa shoguns united the country in the 17th century. It was famous for its pleasure quarter, “the floating world”, and the new art genre it inspired – ukiyo-e, “pictures of the floating world”. In the scroll, samurai warriors are seen visiting courtesans. But samurai were banned from the pleasure quarter so they wear straw hats pulled down to hide their faces. The comically phallic swords peeping out from their robes give them away.

                    <span>Lions head coach knows the Springboks will throw everything at his team and has picked a side to absorb that pressure
The last time the British &amp; Irish Lions lost a Test series having taken an initial 1-0 lead was in Australia 20 years ago. They had smashed the Wallabies 29-13 in Brisbane and were 11-6 up at half-time in the second Test in Melbourne, courtesy of two Jonny Wilkinson penalties and a try by Neil Back. One nasty, well-documented injury to Richard Hill and a costly interception try later and the outcome ended up being very different.
That is why Warren Gatland will be stressing to his players this week that complacency must be avoided. Given how ominous the situation was looking for the visitors at half-time in the first Test, his squad will already understand just how quickly things can change. South Africa are going to come at them ferociously hard on Saturday because, frankly, they have no other option.

                    <span>From silencing opponents to spying on citizens, the world’s authoritarians are refining a strategy for perpetual rule
Democracy depends on an equality of arms. If governments acquire political weapons unavailable to their opponents, they become harder to dislodge. They now possess so many that I begin to wonder how an efficient autocracy, once established, might ever again be overthrown.
The Pegasus spyware, whose widespread use by governments the Guardian has helped reveal, is just the latest variety of asymmetric force. The ability to peer into someone’s life from a distance, to track their every movement, word and intention, grants autocrats an unprecedented power. It turns us into informants against ourselves. No one subject to this spying can now plan, however peacefully and democratically, to replace a government without those plans being known in advance and in all likelihood thwarted.

                    <span>Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are romancing riverboat adventurers in a ride-turned-film that quickly becomes bland
The Jungle Cruise theme-park ride is a riverboat trip that Disneyland visitors have been queuing up for since the 1950s: an old-timey craft travelling down an artificial jungle river, with a jolly captain pointing out animatronic animals lurching out of the artificial undergrowth. Now it’s been adapted into a blandly inoffensive piece of generic entertainment: screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who once gave us Bad Santa and I Love You Phillip Morris) have mashed up The African Queen with Raiders of the Lost Ark, and with what I admit is a surreal splash of Aguirre, Wrath of God.
It’s lively enough for the first 20 minutes. The year is 1916, and Emily Blunt plays Lily Houghton, a haughty yet idealistic British scientist, much patronised by the male establishment in London. She imperiously hires a riverboat in Brazil to find the much-rumoured “Tree of Life” somewhere in the jungle. Its captain is a cynical-with-a-heart-of-gold rogue called Frank Wolff, man-mountainishly played by Dwayne Johnson. After the traditional meet-cute, their growing romance plays off the comedy turn provided by Jack Whitehall, playing the other passenger: Lily’s foppish, neurotic younger brother MacGregor. At one stage, Whitehall’s prissy, wussy Englishman explains to Dwayne Johnson that he is gay – or rather, he says something indirect about being not as other men, and the subject is never raised again, Edwardian reticence dovetailing nicely with Disney family values. It is a stereotype that Walt himself might have recognised, while also approving of the obvious heterosexuality of Frank with his muscles, boots and sailor’s cap.

Salmon in the Columbia River were exposed to unlivable water temperatures that caused them to break out in angry red lesions and white fungus in the wake of the Pacific north-west’s record-shattering heatwave, according to a conservation group that has documented the disturbing sight.
In a video released on Tuesday by the non-profit organization Columbia Riverkeeper, a group of sockeye salmon swimming in a tributary of the river can be seen covered in injuries the group say are the results of stress and overheating.

The electric road system – or e-highway – study, backed with £2m of funding, will draw up plans to install overhead cables on a 20km (12.4 miles) stretch of the M180 near Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire. If the designs are accepted and building work is funded the trucks could be on the road by 2024.

                    <span>Male spending – on petrol and meat – is apparently worse for the environment than women’s. But it’s the system, not individuals, that needs to change
Sorry, boys, but it’s all your fault. Melting ice caps, flash floods, rising sea levels: men are to blame for the lot of it. Please don’t drown the messenger, I’m just relaying the results of a Swedish study that found that men’s spending habits cause 16% more climate-heating emissions than women’s. The biggest difference seems to be that men spend more money on petrol. Another big difference: the men surveyed bought more meat than women. So this is the way the world ends, eh? Not with a bang, but with blokes eating too many burgers.
I don’t know how many studies published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology go viral, but this paper has had an enormous amount of traction. Of course, this is largely because its findings leant themselves to delicious clickbait such as Men Are Worse for Climate Change Than Women Because They Love Meat and Cars. To be fair, the study didn’t lean into gender war territory in the way you would expect based on the headlines it generated. Gender wasn’t even mentioned in the paper’s title, which was “Shifting expenditure on food, holidays, and furnishings could lower greenhouse gas emissions by almost 40%”.

Time and again, ministers have launched schemes from their desks in Westminster that profoundly impact health, safety and lives without ever asking the views of workers and their unions. Dealing with the economic chaos caused by workers in critical sectors being pinged by the NHS app is just the latest example.

Michael Vaughan says a full-strength England team is unlikely

England’s players will seek clarity in the coming days over whether their families will be allowed to join them in Australia for this winter’s Ashes series, amid concerns that some might decide not to participate if it means being separated for several months.
While England’s schedule is always busy – over the last two years they have had 23% more scheduled days of international cricket than India and 54% more than Australia – their forthcoming fixture list is so hectic that a player involved in all of their matches in every format would not get more than a few consecutive days at home between next week and next February.

Failure to help poor countries ‘could cost global economy $4.5tn’

Given the ebbs and flows of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund’s assessment of the state of the global economy has changed little over the past three months. Back in April the IMF said world growth would be a chunky 6% this year and it has left that forecast unchanged.
Beneath the surface, though, plenty has been going on. The outlook for advanced countries has improved while that for emerging market economies has deteriorated. A new north-south divide is opening up and that’s a big concern.

Larry Elliott: Global economic recovery from Covid could go wrong

The world economy risks losing $4.5tn (£3.3tn) from highly infectious variants of Covid-19 spreading through poor countries where vaccination rates are lower, the International Monetary Fund has warned.
Calling on rich countries to take urgent action to share at least 1bn doses with developing nations, or risk severe economic consequences, the Washington-based fund said the gap between rich and poor economies had widened during the pandemic and risked worsening further next year.
