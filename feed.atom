Cheap taxi rides and discounts from the biggest takeaway companies are to be deployed by the government in a desperate effort to boost Covid vaccination rates among the young, amid growing legal and political pressure on Boris Johnson over the use of vaccine passports.
With figures inside the cabinet concerned about the plans already in place to enforce vaccine passports in some settings, the government’s focus has turned to using incentives to drive up vaccination rates over the summer to head off another Covid wave as offices, schools and universities reopen.

When Laura Muir was a teenager, she was so fast that local farmers employed her to catch newborn lambs before they got lost. Now, though, she will have to chase two lions to win gold at these Tokyo Olympics. The first, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, is going for an unprecedented treble of 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m at the same Games. The second, Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon, recently ran the fourth‑quickest 1500m time in history.
However, the popular Scot is convinced she has a shot at the podium, which would be her first in a world outdoor event, and is in the “greatest shape” of her life. The bookies agree and make her third favourite for the 1500m when it begins on Monday.

Gatland refuses to blame refereeing decisions after loss

Warren Gatland has warned that Rassie Erasmus’s social media outbursts could set a dangerous precedent and has urged World Rugby to act, following the British & Irish Lions’ second Test defeat by South Africa. Gatland’s side were comprehensively beaten by the Springboks after Erasmus’s rants at perceived injustices by officials last week provoked the desired response from the world champions.
The Lions led 9-6 after a first half in which South Africa’s Cheslin Kolbe was fortunate to escape a red card after taking out Conor Murray in the air. Robbie Henshaw was also denied a try just before the interval in a marginal decision by the referee, Ben O’Keeffe of New Zealand, but the Springboks turned the screw thereafter.

For three decades, Phil Mather has harvested olives from feral trees around South Australia. Mather, a landscape gardener, began hand-picking the fruit and pressing it into oil in his early 20s.
It’s a seasonal pastime that has turned into a business in the past eight years. “This year I have produced over 1,500 litres, which entails nearly nine tonnes of wild fruit and [olives from] relinquished groves,” he says. Now 51, he sells most of his oil locally, at the Willunga Farmers Market and through retailers in Adelaide.

Seventeen. That is the number of gold medals the Australian Olympic team won at the 2004 Games in Athens. It represents the most successful ever Olympics for Australia, one gold medal ahead of Sydney 2000 and four ahead of Melbourne 1956.
Of course, there are many ways to measure Olympic success. The Americans are fond of ordering their medal tally by total medals won, which sometimes boosts the United States above other nations. After the 2008 Games, when China won the most gold medals and the USA won the more medals overall, then-International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge took a diplomatic stance. “I believe each country will highlight what suits it best,” he said. “We take no position on that.” (Although the medal count on the IOC website ranks by gold).

In the 10 years since Raphaël Varane joined Real Madrid, he hasn’t done much. Apart from win the Copa del Rey, three league titles and four European Cups. There’s the World Cup, too; 360 games at the biggest club of all, and 79 more for France. But that’s about it. In his first clásico, a Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou, he cleared one chance one off the line, stopped Lionel Messi taking another and scored a superb header; in the second leg he scored again, taking Madrid to the final. He was 19, and it was all downhill from there.
Varane is 28 now, has racked up 18 winners’ medals, and has gone. Which tends to be about the time people realise what they’ve got. Varane’s departure has been a story followed closely for months – the first hint he might leave came more than a year ago – but its conclusion has passed relatively quietly. Perhaps the most striking part of his move to Manchester United is that there has been little eulogy or lament, no tearful farewells nor fierce criticism that it came to this.

Millions of voters who Labour must win back if it is to regain power have little idea what the party stands for or why it would improve their lives, according to a stark internal analysis by Keir Starmer’s new strategist.

Former pollster Deborah Mattinson, who has been appointed director of strategy in a shake-up of the leader’s inner circle, briefed Starmer, shadow ministers and MPs on sobering internal polling and findings from focus groups days before the summer recess. Her presentation highlighted the huge challenge Labour faces if it is to win back trust in time for a probable 2023 election – and avoid a fifth consecutive loss to the Tories.

Nigel Farage may not be the best-loved emergency service, but as demonstrated by his recent work for GB News, the struggling, consciously patriotic news channel, he is always available, willing to take on jobs most broadcasters wouldn’t touch, and delivers reliably transformative effects.
Two weeks ago, GB News was considered merely unpleasant, unsuccessful and unwatchably amateurish. Now, with its new Farage programme on every day, it looks well placed to be far more intensely and widely disliked, including by those who haven’t seen the channel’s line in impartial headlines – “Cocky Forecasters”, “Freedom Farce” – and now never will. Though, after watching the channel last week, I can’t really think of this as – on their part – a loss.

Tokyo blues. Dina Asher-Smith did pretty well, all things considered, to keep it together for the opening minute and seven seconds of a startlingly raw post-race debrief in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium, and fresh from elimination in the semi-final of the 100 metres.
The past five weeks have, it turns out, been an extraordinary story of cloak and dagger rehab for the fastest British woman ever to take to the track. On 26 June Asher-Smith felt a pop in her hamstring en route to winning the Team GB trials in Manchester in a time of 10.97sec. As she told the gathered journalists in that Tokyo hanger, “You were all looking at the clock, you didn’t know what the story was.”

As it set, Team GB’s biggest track and field star Dina Asher-Smith broke down after revealing her secret injury heartache. In between, another day of seesawing drama played out again.

But late on Saturday night in Tokyo, Belinda Bencic stepped into the light and clinched the greatest achievement of her career by becoming an Olympic champion, defeating the Czech Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 2-6, 6-3.
In a tense, volatile match filled with sharp momentum swings, Bencic was considerably more disciplined than her opponent and her consistency was rewarded on the biggest points at the close as she won the final three games to take the match. Despite how composed she appeared, Bencic said she spent much of it on the edge.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Britain faces the prospect of thousands of annual Covid deaths for years to come, scientists have warned.
They say waves of cases are likely to sweep the country every winter as Covid-19 joins other seasonal viruses, including influenza, in taking its toll of elderly and infirm people. Every year, as cold weather forces people indoors, virus transmission will increase, case numbers will rise, and some of these will result in deaths.

A year ago this week, one of the planet’s gravest industrial accidents caused one of its biggest ever explosions, shattering a city that was already at a tipping point.

Even amid the chaos of a country that had allowed this to happen to its people, this was surely a moment of reckoning.

If one thing has become obvious in the summer heat and the inevitable baring of flesh, it’s the degree to which body art is now the norm. At the pool, the park, or the pub beer garden, you’ll find an enormous variety of designs inked on the skin representing the breadth of human creativity.
About 20% of adults in the UK now have at least one tattoo, and that proportion is likely to grow. Cynics might argue that the increased uptake is a superficial fad, based purely on the aesthetic appeal of tattoos. In this view, they might be the result of a momentary impulse to follow a passing trend followed by years of regret, rather than something that holds deep meaning.

For his screen-print project Fifty-Nine Parks, now collected in a book, he asked modern artists to reinterpret America’s classic national park posters, commissioned by the government in the 1900s.
“I hope they inspire people to visit the parks and connect with nature, but, heck, it’d be awesome if the book inspired folks to pick up a squeegee and start printing too,” he says.

Kings and queens are immortalised in statues, prime ministers are remembered with official portraits, but an opposition leader best known for his pacifism before the second world war has to make do with a fading mural, knocked up on a crumbling wall beside an east London housing estate in the middle of the night by a local rugby player.
The mural of George Lansbury, who led the Labour party from 1932 to 1935 before resigning over his opposition to rearmament, may not be the world’s finest piece of street art. But it depicts a lesser known and arguably more important moment of his political career – one that only those with a keen interest in Labour party history will know much about.

Brexit is beginning to take its toll. Trade with the EU is suffering and foreign investment is heading south. Neither trend is temporary and both harm the government’s stated aim of “levelling up” regions that until now have depended on overseas trade to create well-paid jobs.
It’s not clear if the red wall has noticed. Or anyone among the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit. So far, all the in-depth polling shows there is little movement on the vexed question of EU membership.

Seven days on from an abortive trip to Ascot, Wonderful Tonight extended her winning streak to four with a comfortable success in the Group Two Lillie Langtry Stakes. David Menuisier’s filly may yet have two more runs before heading to the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, as her connections try to decide on a jockey for the big race in Paris on 3 October.
William Buick, who is getting married on Sunday, has been in exceptional form all week and rode a confident race on Wonderful Tonight, the 8-11 favourite. The four-year-old, racing over 14 furlongs for the first time in four starts, took a strong hold in the early stages but still had more than enough left to stride on over two furlongs out, before holding Tribal Craft and Albaflora with ease.

A couple of years ago, during a meeting of Tibetan leaders in Dharamshala in India, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, was asked about his reincarnation. Addressing the room of monks, religious teachers and Tibetan politicians, the Dalai Lama asked them to look into his eyes. “Do you think it’s time now?” he asked.
It was a meeting that would end with the Tibetan leaders agreeing that the issue of reincarnation was one that would be decided only by the Dalai Lama himself. But China, which annexed Tibet in 1951 and has retained tight control over the region ever since, has other ideas. It insists that the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with China, and have even enshrined this right into Chinese law.

I’m not in a nightclub greeting sunrise with a tequila, sadly, but in an east London café. The source of my palpitations? I’m steeling myself to strike up a conversation with an unsuspecting man a few tables away.
Given that I’m a journalist who interviews people for a living, you might think I’m being overly dramatic. But talking to strangers can be terrifying. The unpredictability of how they will respond to your overture, and the possibility of rejection, is paralysing. Perhaps the worst fear of all: might they find me annoying?

See all the Guardian’s stories as part of the Pegasus project investigation

What’s the most problematic tech company in the world? Facebook? Google? Palantir? Nope. It’s a small, privately held Israeli company called NSO that most people have never heard of. On its website, it describes itself as “a world leader in precision cyberintelligence solutions”. Its software, sold only to “licensed government intelligence and law-enforcement agencies”, naturally, helps them to “lawfully address the most dangerous issues in today’s world. NSO’s technology has helped prevent terrorism, break up criminal operations, find missing people and assist search and rescue teams.”
So what is this magical stuff? It’s called Pegasus and it is ultra-sophisticated spyware that covertly penetrates and compromises smartphones. It’s particularly good with Apple phones, which is significant because these devices are generally more secure than Android ones. This is positively infuriating to Apple, which views protecting its users’ privacy as one of its USPs.

His business – importing woven shoes from Guangzhou, China, to sell in the northern city of Kano and his home state of Abia, further south – had been suffering along with the country’s economy. The ban threatened to tip it over the edge. “It was a serious crisis: I had to act fast,” Awa says.
He turned to his younger brother, Osy, who had begun trading bitcoins. “He was just accumulating, accumulating crypto, saying that at some point years down the line it could be a great investment. When the forex ban happened, he showed me how much I needed it, too. I could pay my suppliers in bitcoins if they accepted – and they did.”

The title is on a knife edge and tempers, too, are being tested.

A couple of weeks ago, I was at Lizard Point in Cornwall. The old lifeboat station below Britain’s most southerly cliffs has long since been replaced but the rusting structure remains, a stubborn legacy of heroism past. It was from here, in February 1907, that the biggest sea rescue in the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) was launched when the liner SS Suevic was thrown on to the jagged reef offshore in high winds and dense fog. For 16 hours, the lifeboat crews rowed out and rescued all 456 passengers (including 71 infants). The ethnicity or country of origin of those rescued was not recorded, as it has not been recorded for the 146,000 other lives saved during the RNLI’s history.
There has been much talk in recent years of the relevance of some of our monuments to the past. The lifeboat stations that circle our coastline, crewed by volunteers and funded by charity, are living reminders of the humanitarian impulse that remains the best of us. Nigel Farage’s attempts to undermine that spirit last week, by characterising boats saving drowning refugees as a “taxi service for migrants”, went against everything that the Lizard lifeboat and all the other crews risk their lives for. The fact that donations to the RNLI are up 3,000% in the days since is a welcome indication that the spirit that sends those crews out is as appreciated now as it ever was.

Future architectural historians will earmark the pandemic as a decisive time for British housing. Incarcerated within our four walls, it is when the deficiencies of our interiors became glaringly obvious. A lack of privacy or a tranquil corner to work in; an absence of outside space; dispiriting views; woeful wifi. All these things need to be addressed.
Rebecca Layoo and Roman Meyer’s east London home might serve as a template for change. Set in a tranquil grid of tree-lined terraced streets, their brick and stucco-fronted two-bedroom house has been unpicked and reconfigured for post-pandemic living. There’s a study with treetop views and a once dismal cellar has become a utility room. At the back, the long bright kitchen-dining extension merges with the garden.

Boarding school was pretty grim: dormitories, horrible food, structure. Mum disappeared and then suddenly I didn’t see Dad for huge chunks of the year either. I don’t like regret, it’s a useless emotion, but I wish Mum – a nurse who didn’t smoke – hadn’t died of cancer. Away from home, I did a lot of crying and feeling sorry for myself.
I broke into Pinewood Studios at 15, after discovering films existed. I kept seeing the same place listed in the credits, and searched for it on a map. From Bexhill-on-Sea I travelled by train, tube and bus, only to be told to fuck off by security. I found an entrance and brazenly marched in. This didn’t jump start my career as planned, but it was magical.

Should we disenfranchise the childfree? If you’re wondering what kind of stupid question that is, the answer is: it’s the sort of stupid question that Fox News hosts and Republicans deem worthy of serious discussion. Last week the intellectuals at Fox News took some time out from vilifying immigrants and inventing things to get outraged about in order to debate whether the “childless left” deserve a vote. After some careful consideration they decided that while it probably wasn’t “feasible” to ban childfree people from participating in society, the idea did have merit.

“It was the scariest day of my life,” says Amin Mohamed, AKA Chunkz, of the day in 2016 that he told his parents he was dropping out of university to focus on his YouTube channel. “I remember waking up for a lecture during the first few weeks of university, and I genuinely stared at my ceiling for 45 minutes, near tears, just thinking: I can’t do this. I had this pressure [weighing on me] that my parents wouldn’t accept me leaving.”
Chunkz is a first generation British Somali (his parents moved here from Somaliland in the late 80s). For me, also a first generation British Somali, he is, as a genuine celebrity from our community, a unique figure – and a local hero. Following in the steps of his three sisters, who had all graduated from university, he was studying financial maths at London Metropolitan University. For Somali kids, it’s not uncommon to have your parents push you toward a “reliable” career. So he stuttered his way through that moment, telling his parents about dropping out of university. His dad avoided eye contact and his mother became really upset. “As I was talking to them, I was doing damage control,” he says.

Team GB were one minute and stoppage time away from an Olympic semi-final when the Australian midfielder Emily van Egmond scooped the ball from just inside the GB half to the chest of an unmarked Sam Kerr. With all the time in the world, Kerr twisted and crashed home an equaliser. The soul-sapping effect of the last-gasp strike proved fatal.
It would be easy to point fingers. Why was the Women’s Super League’s most potent finisher alone in the middle of the area with seconds left on the clock? Britain’s defence consisted of Kerr’s Chelsea teammate Millie Bright and several players who have attempted – with admittedly mixed results – to contain her guile domestically.

As a single-celled animal, your options are limited – and yet this gem of a game is a masterclass in minimalism
Ynglet is not the first video game to cast its player as an amoeba. Without an expansive repertoire of abilities to call upon, the single cell organism protagonist presents a certain kind of game designer with an alluring challenge. When all a player can do is swim, dash and float about a bit, puzzle and challenge must be carefully constructed from first principles. If it works, as in Ynglet, a meditative, chic jewel of a short game from Swedish designer Nicklas Nygren, there is a purity and clarity of design that none of the medium’s sprawling action epics, with their mythically capable warriors, can rival.
Contrary to appearance, this is not a game viewed top-down, as if through a microscope’s viewfinder. Rather, it’s a sideways-on biosphere, in the Super Mario style: your frondy amoeba is subject to gravity’s inexhaustible attempts to tug your character off the bottom of the screen. To navigate each of the game’s eight worlds, you must hurl yourself between bubbles of water, which catch and suspend you until you dash toward the next point of safety while seeking the exit. Ynglet is about managing momentum, about estimating arcs and trajectories while desperately trying, in common with all life forms, to resist the inexorable pull of oblivion.

I’m always amazed by the sheer variety of fruits that exist in nature, each with their own personality. This lime sorbet is robust with the sour taste of citric acid, but also has that delightful, refreshing perfume that is most welcome on a hot summer day. Makrut lime leaves are used in Thai cooking to build citrus flavours in curries, and infusing a few leaves into the base of the sorbet adds a hint of their special aroma. Taking a step away from the citrus is a roast grape salad with hints of fresh herbs, lemon and creamy sheep’s cheese; slices of warm, toasted sourdough with butter are a great way to finish up.

The rose-pink thatched cottage in the seaside village of Walberswick, Suffolk – home to designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi – isn’t as ancient, or incongruous, as you might think. Built in the 1940s “to look old”, its colour isn’t some fashionable flight of fancy; rather, it’s quite common in this part of the world, Thornton says. “Pink houses are traditional in Suffolk. People would mix natural pigments such as elderberry or ox blood with limewash.” The pair, who run the British fashion label Preen, used Nancy’s Blushes from Farrow & Ball to similar effect.

• Read an exclusive extract from Chaise Longue: ‘After a certain point of drinking, Dad’s behaviour became a lottery’
Baxter Dury strolls up to the pub, casually dressed and apologetic. The indie musician, known for his stylish suits, is wearing a white vest and unbuttoned denim shirt. His face is even whiter than the vest. Food poisoning. He ate oysters the other day, and has never been so sick. He orders a pineapple juice and soda water, sheepishly. “That’s going to be the headline, isn’t it?” The 2010 biopic about his father was named Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll – after one of Ian Dury’s most celebrated songs, and a fair summary of his life.
But we’re not here to talk about Dad, says Baxter, a successful musician in his own right. It’s 21 years since his father died, and 19 since Baxter recorded his debut album, the fabulously titled Len Parrot’s Memorial Lift. Don’t get me wrong, he says, he loved the old man, but he’s got Ian Dury fatigue. He’s tired of the comparisons – their music, voice, looks and lifestyle.

Consider the dunnock. This gentle, soft and feathery bird flits about unnoticed, unseen, tidying away the leftover seeds of other greedy birds. It camouflages with earth, tied up in its beauty. The sparrow and dunnock are often confused. “Oh, look, there’s a sparrow,” someone may say. But it is not; it’s a unique dunnock, unknown, unheard. Its song is that of the robin but higher and sweeter. Once again, no one knows the true singer. Dunnocks fly low, popping out from the trunks of bushes. They have intricate tunnels and pathways through tall forget-me-nots and grasses. Timidly, they dance under the drooping leaves of bluebells.
Today, however, we venture out beyond the garden. We are looking for some slightly more exotic birds, the nightingale and the skylark. We walk with the breeze cooling our cheeks, till we come to the water meadow where the skylarks nest. A winding freshwater river skips through it, with blossoming hawthorn and wild damson bending over its little coves where the nightingales nest. A nightingale sings suddenly while two skylarks hover above their “nests” twittering. Their songs are high and sweet – like that of the dunnock, but the dunnock will always be there in my garden through the cold of winter and the heat of summer.

For many UK workers, insecurity is not a new problem, but one that the pandemic has both exposed and deepened. The weakness of employment rights and the imbalance of power between workers and bosses has gone unaddressed for too long. Throughout the pandemic, the devastating consequences of unsafe working conditions, financial insecurity and the lack of a strong worker voice have made the need for urgent change clear.
Yet the government has shown no intention of making this change. It has ditched its long-promised employment bill. Over the past 16 months, a lack of clarity about safe working practices and weak enforcement of health and safety laws have endangered workers on the frontline and resulted in thousands of avoidable deaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by a desire to be good and help others during the pandemic, novelist Sarah Perry trained to vaccinate people. But what does it mean to be good when there is so much bad faith?
Earlier this year – lockdown three: no sign of spring – I travelled to an airport to try to be good. Dogged for months by the sense of my own uselessness, and having wept with relief and accumulated sorrow when the first Covid-19 vaccine was approved, I’d joined an organisation training volunteers to deliver vaccinations, and so arrived at a desolate Stansted shortly after dawn. Here I sat in the basement of a hotel fallen almost out of use, and in the company of a hundred strangers – though alone and masked in a square of carpet marked out with black tape – learned how to treat fainting fits, panic attacks and anaphylactic shock. In our number were a circus performer, a firefighter, a consultant of some kind; and having been starved of unfamiliar faces for so long we were all, I think, happy to be there (putting a woman in the recovery position I apologised for what seemed a shocking intimacy; but she said what a pleasure it was, after all that time, to be touched). Then we attached sponges to our upper arms, and learned how to insert the needle at 45 degrees, stretching the skin to avoid a bleed; how to depress the plunger, and then remove the needle without doing ourselves a mischief. Then, observed by the nurse, who’d hurried out of retirement to train us, we demonstrated our prowess, were awarded a certificate, and went home to await deployment.

On a bright morning in July, a crowd gathered on a boat ramp in St Augustine, Florida, awaiting the arrival of a young male manatee named Gerard. The marshy Matanzas River gently flowed around oyster beds and sawgrass islands as biologists organized their equipment. Nearby about a dozen onlookers paced by the shore, waiting to catch a glimpse of Gerard’s return to the wild following weeks of captivity.
Earlier in spring, beachgoers discovered Gerard stranded and sunbaked in Palm Coast, about 25 miles south of St Augustine, on the Atlantic Ocean. Samaritans draped wet towels over the feeble marine mammal, keeping him cool and shaded from the subtropical sun, as a rescue team raced to the scene. Gravely thin, Gerard was transported to Jacksonville Zoo, where he spent the next 10 weeks in critical care until he was plump enough to re-enter the wild.

In May last year, Sky Brown, the young skateboarding phenom, almost died when she fell 15ft onto her head while transitioning between vert ramps at a skate park in California. The horrifying impact fractured the 12-year-old’s skull, broke her wrist and hand, and left her unconscious as she was airlifted to hospital.
Footage of the accident was uploaded to Brown’s popular YouTube channel and viewed millions of times. Lesser skaters would feel deeply uneasy about returning to the sport and repeating such tricks, but not Brown: she’s famed for being fearless.

Modern Toss on comedy at the fringe
the best of fringe, in person and online

It’s a feeling of pure joy. Over the last year and a half, I’ve recorded a lot of stuff in what I pretentiously call the studio at the end of the garden, but the fringe? I’ve spent a month every year for the past 21 years at the fringe. Weirdly, what I miss is the liminal time backstage with other comedians. Even if you absolutely storm a Zoom gig, with one click of a button you go from being on stage to instantly back in the hotel room. It’s very disconcerting. When the pandemic kicked in, I was in the middle of a tour of Ireland. At the end of 2019 I did I’m a Celebrity, and the show was called Reality – it was a bit of a play on that. I was going to take it to the fringe in 2020, but obviously it got parked. In the meantime, I carried on writing. So the show is now an amalgam of two years of material. Does it mention Covid? I’ll always point out an elephant in the room. I won’t necessarily discuss the trunk of the elephant for a solid hour or what shade of grey it is, but I always mention the elephant.

The US Department of Justice sued Texas Governor Greg Abbott today over his order to stop migrants from entering the state or being transported through it, unless by law enforcement officials. 
According to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in El Paso, only the federal government has jurisdiction over immigration, Reuters reports. 
 The order, which Abbott signed on Wednesday, permits only ‘law enforcement officials’ to provide ground transport for migrants detained for illegally crossing the southern border. It also gives the state’s public safety department the authority to stop any vehicle suspected of carrying migrants and send it back to its point of origin.

The order would interfere with the U.S. government’s ability to transport migrants between facilities, including unaccompanied children, according to the lawsuit. The government regularly employs contractors and other non-law enforcement personnel to transfer migrants.

The first Prom to welcome an audience back into the Royal Albert Hall began with a work of low-key celebration, Vaughan Williams’s Serenade to Music. As its last chord died away, something else took its place: a collective silence, the kind that’s conjured when hundreds of people hold their breath, all listening intently to the same thing. This kind of delicious communal moment is what was missing last summer, when the Proms were performed with no audience in the hall.
Things aren’t quite back to normal yet. This season runs for six weeks, not eight. To make more room for distanced orchestral players, the stage has been expanded. And although seats are being sold with no social distancing and there’s the potential for audiences to reach something approaching 5,000, that wasn’t the case: the arena can’t have held more than 150 prommers standing, and anyone daunted by the idea of sitting up close to a stranger for two hours will have been reassured to see plenty of empty seats. But the audience was big enough to create a buzz. As the conductor Dalia Stasevska greeted the audience with a delighted wave, the mood was jubilant.

Annie Mac has a terrible memory. It’s a trait the DJ has mentioned repeatedly in interviews – often blaming her profession’s sleepless lifestyle – and even based an entire podcast series around: Finding Annie was premised on her desire to dig up lost memories related to crucial aspects of her life, from childbirth to Irishness.
It’s also been a running joke on her final stretch of BBC Radio 1 shows. As the 43-year-old prepares to depart the station this week after 17 years of broadcasting, she has found herself with the strange task of summing up her own legacy – which is especially hard when you can’t recall great swathes of your career (including an interview with Rihanna). Luckily, the BBC archives act as a handy back-up memory. Mac starts her final broadcast by replaying her first ever link on her first ever show, 2004’s The Mash Up. Self-effacingly recounting her failure to find something with “symbolism and hidden meaning” to kick things off, the young Mac has instead resorted to a track by High Contrast notable only for sparking joy. This show, she concludes, is “all about things that make you jump up and down and say yeah!”

Kevin Pietersen and Gary Lineker are among the sporting figures to show support for Ben Stokes after the England all-rounder decided to take an indefinite break from cricket with immediate effect “to prioritise his mental wellbeing”.
The England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Friday evening that Stokes will play no part in the forthcoming Test series against India. As well as stepping back for the sake of his mental wellbeing, the 30-year-old is also seeking to rest his injured left index finger, which has not fully healed since his return to competitive cricket.

The document, a slide presentation prepared by officials within the US’s health protection agency first obtained by the Washington Post, warned that the Delta variant is as infectious as chickenpox, and argues that government officials must “acknowledge the war has changed” given how dangerous the variant is.

The publishing company and widow of Jacques Levy, a collaborator on the 1976 album Desire, sought at least $7.25m from the sale of 10 songs. Dylan said Levy worked under agreement and was only entitled to a percentage of royalties.

Pressure is mounting on ministers to outlaw “no jab, no job” policies being implemented by companies, amid warnings firms could be hit by a wave of legal action due to claims of discrimination.
After major US businesses including Google and Facebook announced plans to only allow fully vaccinated staff to set foot in their offices due to the spread of the Delta variant already rampant in the UK, senior government figures on this side of the Atlantic appeared relaxed about other businesses following suit.

Bellerín and Xhaka keen to move and have suitors

Arsenal have completed the signing of Ben White from Brighton in a £50m deal that makes him their third-most expensive arrival of all time, and will now turn their attention to persuading two senior players to stay at the Emirates.
White had been one of Mikel Arteta’s top summer targets and his ability to pass out from defence, as well as step into midfield, was seen as a key component in speeding up Arsenal’s game in possession. Although the 23-year-old centre-back effectively replaces David Luiz, he is more than a decade younger and appears yet to reach his ceiling. He will take the No 4 shirt and has signed a five-year contract.

Cabinet ministers Ben Wallace and Brandon Lewis, plus the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, were among those who benefited from free tickets declared during July, with more than 35 MPs in total accepting hospitality as they took part in the research project.

The investigation into the deadly insurrection of 6 January is not one but two processes. The first is an attempt to discover the truth about those events: not only what happened, but who, beyond the members of the mob, was responsible and in what ways. The second is the task of getting people to accept that truth – knowing that many will not.
Senior Republicans initially acknowledged the horror of the events and the culpability of Donald Trump, whose big lie of a stolen election triggered the assault upon the Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader – who is said to have telephoned the president urging him to call the rioters off as they tried to break through his office window – said that Mr Trump bore responsibility. He and others called for a 9/11-style independent commission.

When Martin Shkreli was convicted of fraud in 2017, the authorities ordered him to give up his assets, which included a Picasso, a share-trading account and the only existing copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, a double album by the American hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan. This week an anonymous buyer purchased the record to clear the disgraced pharmaceutical executive’s remaining $2.2m debt to the US government and committed to Wu-Tang Clan’s stipulation that it not be released commercially until 2103.
The sale is a testament to both the artists and their art. The rap group – RZA, GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, Masta Killa and sometimes Cappadonna – emerged in the 1990s and challenged hip-hop’s aesthetic principles and its business model. With interests in martial arts, philosophy and mystical Islam, their wordplay set them apart. On their 1997 track Triumph, Inspectah Deck raps “I bomb atomically, Socrates’ philosophies and hypotheses / Can’t define how I be dropping these mockeries”.

Fists clenched, neck muscles fanned, Schlegel continued to roar, a kind of wild-man victory bark. Ten minutes earlier he had run the anchor leg in Germany’s mixed 4x400 relay team. His quartet, two women and two men, had just qualified for Saturday’s Olympic final by the finest of margins.

Max Verstappen quickest in Friday morning’s practice session

Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen may want to do their talking on track at this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix but their teams remain firmly entrenched in opposition as the verbal sallies continued to fly on Friday at the Hungaroring. After the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers clashed at the British Grand Prix, the tension of an already fiercely fought championship ratcheted up a level and neither teams nor drivers are clearly ready yet for a rapprochement.
On Thursday Red Bull’s request for a review into the drivers’ clash at Silverstone was rejected by the FIA stewards. The incident in which Verstappen was knocked out of the race in an 180mph crash after Hamilton clipped him attempting to pass at Copse left Red Bull furious, with their team principal, Christian Horner, accusing the world champion of dirty driving. The Dutch driver also blamed his Mercedes counterpart while Hamilton, although given a 10-second penalty for being predominantly at fault, bullishly insisted he would repeat the move again if given the chance.

Wild swimming “the latest fashionable activity” (Letters, 26 July)? Hardly. Seventy years ago I learned to swim in the River Wey, in the company of other local kids (and a lot of water voles and a pair of nesting swans). Forty-five years ago we spent innumerable happy afternoons with our children swimming and splashing in the River Cherwell at Wolvercote – and there were other popular river bathing places in Oxford. Last week I took my granddaughter swimming in the River Chew. Wild swimming is certainly not a new fashion, though it has become riskier with the current levels of pollution in our rivers and lakes (not very beneficial for kingfishers, either).

• I’ve been swimming locally for five years. Most of the year I’m accompanied by seals, otters, geese, oystercatchers and a variety of other seabirds. In summer, the campervans roll in. Their owners don’t swim, but the wildlife disappears – so don’t blame the swimmers for disturbing wildlife.

Your article (Welsh slate landscape becomes UK’s newest world heritage site, 28 July) did not mention the origins of the finance that enabled the expansion of the slate quarries at the end of the 18th century. In 1781, Richard Pennant inherited the family’s estates in Jamaica and in north Wales. He owned four sugar plantations in Jamaica, worked by more than a thousand enslaved workers. The money Pennant generated from sugar and slavery in Jamaica was invested in building road, railway and port infrastructure, as well as expanding the slate industry in Wales, in particular his Penrhyn slate quarry.
Pennant became MP for Petersfield in 1761 and, in 1767, one of the two MPs for Liverpool, Britain’s major slave trading port. He was chairman of the West India Committee, an organisation of merchants and plantation owners that campaigned for the continuation of slavery. He frequently spoke in the Commons against abolition of the slave trade.

He proceeded to come into my school, which was against the protocol, then he took me into a room and started saying these racist, misogynistic things, and making me feel uncomfortable,” she said. “People just have no faith in the system whatsoever.”

Future generations will look back on the climate events of 2021 and say: “That was the year they ran out of excuses.”
Heatwaves and flooding here in the UK, temperatures topping 50C in Pakistan, hundreds killed by a heatwave in British Columbia, deadly floods in Germany and China. All within a single month. Add to that the recent dire warning from the Met Office that the age of extreme weather has just begun.

Springboks lash out at touring side ahead of second Test 

The South Africa captain Siya Kolisi has made the remarkable claim that he was shown a lack of respect by the referee Nic Berry during last Saturday’s defeat by the British & Irish Lions as the Springboks lashed out at the touring side, accusing Warren Gatland of “destroying the dignity of the series”.
Doubling down on Rassie Erasmus’s outburst over perceived injustices from officials as the extraordinary war of words intensified before Saturday’s second Test, Kolisi agreed with his director of rugby that he was treated differently to the Lions captain Alun Wyn Jones. The Springboks assistant Mzwandile Stick then took a swipe at Gatland for making his anger known about the appointment of the South African TMO Marius Jonker last week. Earlier, Rugby Australia slammed Erasmus for an “unacceptable” attack on Berry, labelling his rant as “against the spirit and values of the game”.

So far, so normal. But what about the Queen’s Celtic? They’ve prepared in the fashion they know best: by tumbling out of Big Cup qualifiers against opponents who, historically, they would have expected to dismiss in relative comfort.

The cooling message emerged hours after China’s military and state media warned the UK against provocation as the group, led by Royal Navy aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth, undertakes what had been expected to be a more assertive deployment.

And while there was little shock – Daley has been a vocal advocate of LGBTQ+ rights for years – there was a joy and ease to his pronouncement that was new. With more publicly out athletes in these Olympics than in all other Games combined, Tokyo 2020 is being hailed as the Rainbow Olympics, with LGBTQ+ rights campaigners hoping its message of positive inclusivity can have a lasting, global impact.

Great Britain also progressed to the semi-finals of the women’s rugby sevens on Friday but there was heartache in the football as the women lost 4-3 to Australia in an extra-time thriller and failed to progress beyond the quarter-finals. There were more medals in the pool, in trampolining and a final bronze in the rowing – bringing to a close an otherwise disappointing regatta for Great Britain.

However, I have a lot of unresolved issues about the way my mother parented me, and the way she behaves today. She was dismissive of my depression and anxiety when I was growing up, and lacked empathy when I self-harmed. She would bring everything back to her, and was scathing of my attempts to treat myself to anything nice. I don’t know how to help build a positive relationship between my child and my mother, when I am mistrustful and wary of her behaviour.

Many things have disappeared from British politics since it became mostly about the pandemic. One of the most important has been the idea that the interests and grievances of people under 40 are worth a lot of attention from the main parties.
During the Jeremy Corbyn era younger voters enjoyed rare influence, reinvigorating Labour and frightening the Conservatives. Even when that period effectively ended at the 2019 election, Labour beat the Tories among voters aged 18 to 24 by an unprecedented 43 percentage points. The sea of young faces at Corbyn rallies looked like a mass awakening that would have consequences.

Ethel Carnie Holdsworth wrote in 1914 that “literature up till now has been lopsided, dealing with life only from the standpoint of one class”. Now the Lancashire mill worker and author, a forgotten name who is believed to be the first working-class woman in Britain to publish a novel, and who in her heyday outsold HG Wells, is set to be celebrated with an alternative blue plaque and a return to print.
Born in Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire in 1886, Holdsworth began working in a textile factory at the age of 11. She also wrote poetry, saying that the rhythm of the looms helped her compose her lines. Dubbed the “Lancashire mill girl poetess” by the local paper, she came to the attention of journalist Robert Blatchford, who gave her a job on his magazine, the Woman Worker. Holdsworth published her first novel, Miss Nobody, in 1913 and went on to write a further nine. She also set up anti-fascist journal the Clear Light, and helped other working-class women learn to read and write. She stopped writing novels in 1946, worn out by the process according to her daughter.

Amanda Knox has accused actor Matt Damon and director Tom McCarthy of “rip[ping] off my story without my consent at the expense of my reputation” in the upcoming film Stillwater, which McCarthy has said was inspired by Knox’s experience after the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy.
In an essay on the online publishing platform Medium, Knox takes particular aim at McCarthy, who told Vanity Fair that Stillwater was directly inspired by the Kercher case, which resulted in Knox being wrongly convicted for Kercher’s murder along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and spending four years in prison, before ultimately being acquitted in 2015 by Italy’s supreme court of cassation. Rudy Guede, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2008, is the only person convicted of Kercher’s murder.

Last year’s I May Destroy You, the 12-part BBC/HBO comedy-drama she created and starred in alongside Weruche Opia and Paapa Essiedu, addressed issues of consent and sexual assault, social media, race and class.

Conditions that led to 2011 UK riots still exist today, experts warn

On 4 August 2011, Mark Duggan was shot and killed by police in Tottenham, north London, sparking the largest civil unrest the UK has seen for a generation. The disturbance quickly spread and for five nights, London, Birmingham, and other major cities in England were engulfed by fire and violence.
On the 10th anniversary of the riot, community leaders and frontline workers reflect on what they witnessed and the impact of those nights.

I have dealt in the past with the ongoing issues related to my inner prick – a voice inside my head that is consistently telling me that I am terrible at everything and should give up as soon as possible. (Sometimes that is my inner prick, and sometimes it is me repeating the comments below the online version of this column.)
I spoke to a couple of people who told me that I needed to retrain this voice to be nicer to me. I went to a therapist who told me to imagine I was sitting on the sofa opposite and to practise being nice to myself. I do find therapy useful, but it does require that you leave self-awareness at the door. I was slightly self-conscious about the fact that I was telling an invisible me that I am actually a very nice man (particularly as I am not entirely sure I believe that).

David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham

Every riot needs a spark. In 1985, I was a teenager when the Broadwater Farm riot took place just yards away from my home. It was lit by the death of Cynthia Jarrett, who suffered a stroke after police officers searched her home. Ten years ago, the riots that again began in Tottenham were ignited by the death of Mark Duggan, who was shot by the police.
The destruction that followed in both cases was horrific, as peaceful protests were hijacked by violent criminals. In 1985, PC Keith Blakelock was killed. In 2011, eight police officers in Tottenham were hospitalised and more than £200m of damage was caused nationwide. I will never forget walking up Tottenham High Road on the Sunday morning after the night before and seeing bricks through broken windows, alongside burned-out cars and shopfronts, and parents standing on the street in their pyjamas comforting their children. In both cases, the peaceful majority of local residents could only watch as their shops, homes and businesses were senselessly turned into ashes by the flames of the mob.

The conditions that led to riots across England 10 years ago still exist today, experts have warned, as data analysis showed significant cuts to youth services in affected areas and an increase in racial disparity in stop and search.
On 4 August 2011, police officers shot and killed Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old mixed-race man, in Tottenham, north London. His death sparked a wave of civil unrest that started the capital and spread to other cities, causing property damage to the value of £40m a day.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

After two months of rising Covid-19 cases in the UK, people have celebrated falling numbers in the past week. But the number of deaths from the virus rose to 131 on Tuesday, the highest since March. Behind those numbers are lives lost and grieving families urging people to get vaccinated and keep taking precautions.
Among those dealing with their grief is Paul Nuttall after the death of his 24-year-old son, Billy – affectionately called “sunbeam” by his dad for his ability to light up a room.
Billy, an Oxford history graduate who was doing a master’s in politics at Manchester, had his life shaken by Covid. He had isolated – barely leaving the house – for 18 months and because of this he gained weight, reaching 190kg (30st). He went to fitness classes with his dad but before they could really make a difference he caught Covid and died on 26 July.

Ernest Hemingway is survived as much by his macho mythology as he is by his writing. Hemingway was in two plane crashes in two days. Hemingway shot himself in both legs while wrangling a shark. Hemingway had at least nine major concussions – and four wives. He had brain damage. He won the Pulitzer and the Nobel prize. He hunted and fished and wrote plays and books and articles and stories, for ever in pursuit of the truest sentence. He was rageful, charming, violent, brilliant and drunk.
Hemingway is also something of a Key West mascot, especially for a week every July, when a festival called Hemingway Days, which coincides with his birthday (this year, he would be 122) honours his legacy by gathering his lookalikes together.

It is nearly 40 years since women first set up a peace camp outside RAF Greenham Common in protest against the storage of US cruise missiles on British soil. 
On the 5th September 1981, a Welsh women’s group, marched from Cardiff to Greenham Common in Berkshire to protest against Nato’s decision to site 96 US cruise nuclear missiles at the RAF base. The women-only peace protest lasted 19 years.

After five weeks of a tightening lockdown, they were not the words Sydney residents wanted to hear: the leader of New South Wales announcing another month of restrictions and telling the state to prepare for things to get worse, not better.
There was further anguish prompted by the daily Covid case numbers, which were rising daily, despite strict stay at home measures.

Mushrooms, toads and moss might not be the most celebrated of nature’s creations, but thanks to goblincore, an aesthetic that is blossoming online as well as in forests, the danker, gnarlier side of nature is enjoying a moment in the sun.
According to the TikTok user @froggiecrocs, AKA Parker, who has more than 90,000 followers who tune in for his goblincore content, it “romanticizes the ugly, lesser appreciated parts of the natural world”. Its trappings include animal skulls and earthworms and its influences range from David Bowie in Labyrinth to the Twilight Saga. According to the trends expert Sabrina Faramarzi, it is about “chaos, dirt and mud”.

Britain’s new high-speed railway will not – repeat: not – get to the north of England. It will go back and forth from London to the Midlands and its chief beneficiaries will be London commuters. All else is political spin.
This became certain last week as the government’s internal major projects authority declared phase two of the HS2 project, to Manchester and Leeds, effectively dead. While the already-started London-to-Birmingham stretch is still marked at “amber/red” for “successful delivery in doubt”, anything north of Crewe has been designated “unachievable”. Its multitudinous issues “do not appear to be manageable or resolvable”. This comes not from the arms-length National Infrastructure Commission or last winter’s Oakervee report, both agreeing that going beyond Birmingham should be “reviewed”. This was the verdict of an arm of the Treasury and Cabinet Office.

Reagan even included “personal responsibility” in his list of America’s bedrock values, right up there with faith in God, honesty, and caring for others.

Dr Mechtild Rössler, the director of Unesco’s World Heritage Centre, urged ministers to “do everything” they could to conserve the UK’s treasures after Liverpool became only the third place in nearly 50 years to lose its revered title.

I had high hopes for this diplomatic incident masquerading as a TV travelogue through Scotland. Fingers crossed, patriarchy’s answer to Katie Hopkins and the Cheeky Girls would get chucked out of Scotland just as they were from Argentina while filming Top Gear. During that 2014 debacle, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond were attacked for driving a Porsche whose number plate – H982 FKL – was deemed a reference to Britain’s victory in the 1982 Falklands conflict. In the resulting unpleasantness, the three presenters took a helicopter to safety, like the last chopper out of Saigon, leaving the crew to defend that oxymoron, British honour.
Indeed, there is surely nothing more apt to make Nicola Sturgeon unleash the ancestral claymore than the sight of three English muppets in gas-guzzling Yank tanks (Lincoln Continental, Cadillac Coupe de Ville and Buick Riviera, each more productive of Greta Thunberg’s tears than a cormorant with its beak stuck in a can of Irn-Bru) heading north from Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Russian winner Rylov says: ‘Ryan didn’t accuse me of anything’

A storm broke out at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre on Friday morning when Ryan Murphy, the USA’s silver medallist in the 200m backstroke, spoke out against the sport’s doping problem and said he was “swimming in a race that’s probably not clean”. Almost any other time, this would have been an admirably honest thing to do, but the problem was Murphy had only just lost to Evgeny Rylov, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, and the comments came across as an accusation. Rylov, 24, won both the 100m and 200m backstroke this week, the 200m with an Olympic record time of 1min 53.27sec.
“I’ve got about 15 thoughts, and 13 of them would get me into a lot of trouble,” Murphy said after the race. “It is a huge mental drain to go through the year knowing that I’m swimming in a race that’s probably not clean, and that is what it is. The people that know a lot more about the situation made the decision that they did. I don’t have the bandwidth to train for the Olympics at a very high level and try to lobby the people that are making the decisions that they’re making the wrong decisions.”

“The slate quarries are beautiful,” a friend told me, having returned from a holiday in Gwynedd, where I grew up. “They are not so beautiful when your ancestors died in them,” I said, half-joking just to see her face. The windows of my childhood home looked out at that landscape, the mountain a series of gradated ledges, like a staircase built for a giant. The workers were long gone, but I used to imagine them, hanging from thin bits of rope hundreds of feet in the air, risking their lives for a pittance, when I watched the rock climbers who flock to the area from all over the world.
Now, after a long local campaign led by bid leader Dafydd Wigley, the slate landscapes of north Wales have won world heritage status in recognition of 1,800 years of slate mining; the people, culture and language, and how the slate from these quarries, as is often said, used to roof the world. The skills of the workers, most of them Welsh-speaking, are now consigned only to museum demonstrations. I was quite small when I first watched a man split a slate with a chisel and mallet and saw the purplish sheet become thinner and thinner beneath his hands. In my father’s house there is a slate fan made by one of our ancestors as an apprentice. There was great pride in those skills, and there continues to be. World heritage status feels like a recognition of that.

My childhood was perfect. I was born and raised in New Jersey and lived in a lovely house with my family around me. For my sixth birthday my mom went all out with a Pocahontas theme – it was amazing. It’s the last beautiful memory I have of my family together. A month later, in December 1995, we were due to travel to Colombia as a family for the first time. I was so excited as it was going to be my first flight. We were travelling to meet family members I had never met before, for a big reunion.
We were rushing on the way to the airport and our car almost flipped over on the way because of the snow on the roads, so we were delayed. It was chaos once we got there – rush, rush, rush. We only just boarded on time, and the plane took off late.

Nobody should have to go to work in their bra and knickers. So when the Norwegian women’s beach handball team were fined earlier this month for defiantly choosing to compete in shorts – rather than the buttock-revealingly skimpy bikini bottoms mandated by their sport’s governing body – it was the organisers of the European championships, not the squad, who ended up looking ridiculous. Why should female athletes have to be served up half-naked, for the benefit of leering audiences?
But the rebellious Norwegians, it turns out, were merely the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Now the Tokyo Olympics are witnessing what looks very much like the beginnings of a movement, as sportswomen increasingly speak out about their experiences of sexualisation and exploitation.

Over the past 18 months, the world has been amazed at how slippery an enemy Covid-19 has proved to be. The virus first detected in China at the end of 2019 has mutated on a regular basis. Vaccines need to evolve because the virus is changing to survive.
The shock to the global economy from the pandemic has been colossal, but things are now looking up – especially for advanced countries. Some are surprised by the pace of recovery, but they perhaps shouldn’t be, because alongside new variants of the virus there has been a new variant of global capitalism.

When Michael Pollan was researching caffeine for his book about naturally occurring drugs, he decided to give it up for three months. The process was not easy: “I was still not quite myself, and neither, quite, was the world,” he writes. “In this new normal, the world seemed duller to me. I seemed duller, too.”
But through his research and his experiences, Pollan came to a view of caffeine that acknowledged its downsides but also embraced its considerable benefits. He tells Rachel Humphreys (who has bravely gone nearly a day without a coffee at the time of the interview and is already feeling the effect) the remarkable story of how caffeine became the world’s dominant drug, and the only one which we have incorporated into day-to-day conventional life – one we hardly think of as a drug at all. With 90% of us taking it regularly, as Pollan notes, “For most of us, to be caffeinated to one degree or another has simply become baseline human consciousness.”

Jackson Lee’s arrest came after a House oversight subcommittee hearing in which Texas Democrats who traveled to DC in order to detail voting restrictions in their state explained how the voting restrictions would disenfranchise Black and minority voters. 
The Democrats had walked out to deny Republicans the two-thirds quorum required to carry out their plan to pass measures that would impose id-requirements on mail-in ballots and ban 24-hour and drive-through voting among other restrictions.

More than 5 million people had a parcel lost or stolen last year, according to Citizens Advice, which has called on the government to start fining firms that keep losing deliveries as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the sector.
Currently, only Royal Mail faces fines for poor service, but the charity said the same sanctions should apply to the whole industry, after surveys showed customers had experienced a range of problems with deliveries. Ten parcels were lost or stolen during each minute over the last 12 months, it claimed.

On perhaps the most anticipated album of 2021, Eilish uses subdued yet powerful songwriting to consider how fame has seeped into every corner of her life 

“I’m getting older,” sings Billie Eilish, who’s 19, on Happier Than Ever’s opening track. “I’ve got more on my shoulders”, she adds, which is certainly true. Her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? wasn’t just a huge global hit, but an album that significantly altered mainstream pop music. Two years on, streaming services are clotted with bedroom-bound, teenage singer-songwriters dolefully depicting their lives: anticipation for what the genuine article does next is understandably running very high.
When We All Fall Asleep … was an album that turned universal teenage traumas – romance, hedonism, friendship groups – into knowingly lurid horror-comic fantasies, in which tongues were stapled, friends buried, hearses slept in and marble walls spattered with blood. That playfulness is less evident on its successor. It flickers occasionally, as on Overheated’s exploration of stardom in the era of social media, complete with death threats (“You wanna kill me? You wanna hurt me?” she mumbles, before giggling: “Stop being flirty”) or on NDA, where the “pretty boy” she entices home is required to sign the titular legal agreement before he leaves. But the overall tone is noticeably more sombre.

It is 28 years since Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south London in an unprovoked racist knife attack, and 22 years since Sir William Macpherson published his groundbreaking report into the police handling of the case. The report led to significant reforms in the law, in policing, in addressing institutional racism and in the attention given to racist crimes. Since then, the pace of reform has slowed. Habits of unequal enforcement have crept back into police relations with black people and other minority communities, slowing the push towards equal recruitment and widening the gap in public confidence. It is past time to take up the cause of reform again.
In an important review of progress and setbacks since Macpherson, the Commons home affairs committee calls today for a new sense of urgency over these vital issues. It is important to recognise that the committee is composed of MPs from across parliament. Four of the members who adopted the report are Conservatives; four, including the chair, Yvette Cooper, are Labour, and one is a Scottish nationalist. In other words, this is a genuinely all-party report, and the authority of its conclusions is greatly enhanced by it.

But despite a concerted effort to increase in-house animation, the movie in question was tellingly not one of their own creation but rather a Covid acquisition, made and primed by Sony for a big-screen release but panic-sold when cinemas shuttered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A powerful new book from the author of White Fragility reveals why profound racism is often found in supposedly liberal spaces
In 1952, the anti-racist activist and librarian Juliette Hampton Morgan famously observed in a letter to a friend that polite white people were “our biggest problem” in combating American white supremacy. The outspoken southern white writer and teacher had been pulling emergency brakes on buses in Montgomery, Alabama when black patrons were intentionally left on the sidewalk, and wrote letters to local newspapers critiquing segregation. What horrified her just as much as the normalised treatment of black Americans was the way white decency obstructed social change. Seventy years later, Robin DiAngelo explores some of the enduring facets of this practice.
Citing deeply revealing and recurring anecdotes from her career as an anti-racist educator, DiAngelo analyses how white Americans who deem themselves inoculated against racism uniquely embody racist practices, including herself. (She characterises racism as “a collective racial bias backed by legal authority and institutional control”, in which individuals and communities participate.) DiAngelo pertinently distinguishes anti-racist strategies from the valued currency of white friendliness, writing: “Niceness does not indicate a lack of racism and is not the solution to racism. Nor does a culture of niceness indicate that racism is not present in the environment.” As evidence for this assessment, she describes straight-up racial illiteracy (such as the perennially irksome “people should just see each other as humans”) from proud liberal attendees who insinuate that they are beyond a workshop on race, demonstrating how a gradation in white supremacy is nevertheless white supremacy.

After heading up to the clouds to take down a nefarious brainwashing facility in the Marvel blockbuster Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson’s next target has been revealed and this time she’s striking much closer to home.
The actor announced on Thursday, via a court filing in Los Angeles, that she would be suing Disney over the release strategy of her first, and last, standalone adventure. The film had been intended for a theatrical-only debut, falling in line with her previous eight outings alongside fellow Avengers, but when Covid-19 shuttered cinemas, it jumped around the schedule before landing a now rather familiar hybrid release: simultaneously available on the big screen as well as on Disney+ for a $30 rental.

It followed similar moves by Shell, drinks company Diageo and Lloyds Banking Group, which helped round out a bumper day for shareholders.

This was supposed to be the night that Simone Biles added yet another star-spangled page to the history books, by becoming the first gymnast to defend an women’s Olympic all-around title for more than 50 years. Instead a new American talent emerged from the shadow of greatness.
While Biles watched and whooped from the stands, 18-year-old Sunisa Lee held her nerve in an epic four-way tussle for gold. She had already made waves by becoming the first Hmong American to compete for Team US – and then again during a nerveless performance in Tuesday night’s team competition after Biles withdrew citing anxiety concerns. This, though, was a performance bursting with energy, boldness and power.

The players and staff of Liverpool football club have observed 97 seconds of silence at their training base in Austria as a tribute to Andrew Devine, 55, who died this week due to the severe brain damage he sustained in the crush at Hillsborough in 1989.
Andre Rebello, the senior coroner of Liverpool, ruled that Devine died directly due to those brain injuries “which were to prove fatal 32 years later”, and that he is legally the 97th victim of the disaster.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Ministers are facing growing criticism for putting France on the new “amber plus” travel list, after concerns were raised about whether they focused too much on variant cases in its Réunion Island territory 5,700 miles (9,180 km) from Paris.
The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, admitted on Thursday the decision to impose tougher restrictions on millions of fully vaccinated French citizens and Britons holidaying or living across the Channel was partly due to the prevalence of the Beta variant on Réunion.

This week has shown that Arab regimes are tough on dissent, but much less interested in its causes. This will create problems for years to come as these states struggle to recover from the pandemic. Tunisia’s presidential power grab is a test for Joe Biden’s democracy and human rights agenda. War has impoverished ancient centres of Arab civilisation. The UN’s Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia this week pointed out that poverty now affects 88% of the population in Syria and 83% in Yemen. Even nations once considered wealthy have been brought low by an unhappy meeting of leadership failures and Covid-19. Lebanon’s leaders are begging for foreign assistance after the local currency plummeted in value and the population ran short of food, fuel and medicine.
The Arab world is a varied place. The latest UN survey shows it diverging into wealthy Gulf absolute monarchies; a set of middle-income countries with more people than their oil reserves can comfortably afford; war zones in some of the largest nations such as Iraq; and very poor states. The oil-rich sheikhdoms are pulling ahead and using their financial and military clout to extend their influence, often with disastrous results. The Arab region, says the UN, hosts more than six million refugees and more than 11 million internally displaced persons. There is little coordinated action to deal with the numerous social challenges, including growing poverty, increased unemployment and persistent gender inequalities. Food insecurity has spread. One can be too downcast: the UN hopes for a silver lining in the prospect of peace in Libya.

Since 2013, she has won the women’s all-around title every single occasion she has been present. Over time, second place had become the only realistic goal for which any other gymnast could strive.
And so, in the wake of Biles’ withdrawal from the all-around competition in Tokyo, the only question to be answered as the rest of the world marched on to the arena was how the top gymnasts would react to this new experience of having a gold medal clearly within reach.

Lord Baker, who initiated controversial school changes under Margaret Thatcher, said he opposed the Department for Education’s (DfE) plans to scrap most applied general qualifications such as BTecs in favour of its new T-levels, which will leave students aged 16 with few alternatives to A-levels. The qualification is designed to be a single two-year course focused on a specific career such as accounting, building services or hair and beauty.

The experiment with electric lorries on the M180 (UK government backs scheme for motorway cables to power lorries, 27 July) is laughable when compared with the lack of interest shown by the government in furthering railway electrification at a time of an HGV driver shortage.
Just 8.5% of freight locomotives in the UK are electric. This lags lamentably behind mainland Europe, thanks in part to gaps as short as two miles in the electrified network. Aside from complete routes, there are merely 50 miles in total which, after electrification, could decarbonise over two million annual miles of freight haulage. Just 14 of these miles connect Britain’s busiest container port, Felixstowe, to the electrified network at Ipswich. The gaps exist thanks to electrified lines largely following radial passenger flows from London, whereas freight routes ignore these.

That was not how Lutalo Muhammad originally planned it, with a third taekwondo medal in a third successive Olympics firmly in the 30-year-old’s sights before injury struck during qualification. It was a huge blow but Muhammad decided to dust himself off and take up the BBC’s offer to be a pundit for its coverage of the four days of taekwondo, working from the Olympic studio in Salford. It was a step into the unknown but one that paid off given how Muhammad performed. He was a revelation, seen most clearly in the online reaction to his punditry. Twitter, it is fair to say, blew up.

Nine officials from the militant group, which is eager for political recognition to bolster the impact of its military victories across much of Afghanistan, met China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in the coastal city of Tianjin on Wednesday.

Manchester City have stepped up their pursuit of Jack Grealish by opening negotiations with Aston Villa. The England playmaker is a key target for City, along with Tottenham’s Harry Kane, and a decision on whether a deal can be struck is expected within days.
Villa are keen to hold on to Grealish and have offered the 25-year-old a new contract. They intend to stand firm and build their team around him but their resolve will be tested if Grealish tells his boyhood club he wants to leave and City come up with a satisfactory fee. The asking price would likely be at least £100m.

Less than an hour after it emerged Red Bull had failed in their attempts to convince the FIA to review Hamilton’s 10-second penalty – following his opening-lap collision with Max Verstappen at the British Grand Prix – Mercedes hit back at their title rivals.

Staff in the arts and creative industries overtook hospitality workers as the most likely to be on furlough in June, as the number of people being paid through the UK scheme dropped by 590,000 to 1.9 million ahead of government subsidy cuts that forced employers to begin paying towards the job protection scheme.
HMRC figures showed that the number of workers on the scheme dropped from 2.5 million to 1.9 million, its lowest level since the start of the Covid pandemic, before a 10% cut in the subsidy to employers at the start of July.

In 2002, as the Scottish parliament was debating a bill to provide the public with a groundbreaking new right to roam, the independent MSP Dennis Canavan spotted a provision that exempted the Queen’s private Balmoral estate from this statutory right. Canavan managed to remove this exemption – but why had ministers ever drafted it in the first place? Did walkers climbing popular hills such as Lochnagar not deserve the same rights as those climbing every other hill in Scotland?
Since then, as the Guardian revealed this week, other acts of the Scottish parliament have exempted the Queen’s personal estates from laws that apply to every other landowner in Scotland. At least 67 Scottish parliamentary bills have been vetted by the Queen over the last two decades, including legislation around planning laws, protections from tenants and property taxation.

Ecosystem-altering plants and animals that wipe out native wildlife, often introduced by humans, have cost the country at least £122m a year on average since 1976, causing structural damage to buildings, clogging waterways and ruining crops.

Instead, they threatened her and her husband. “These men can do anything. They can even kill us,” the victim says to the reporter, Meera, who is filming on her smartphone. As Meera leaves, the woman’s husband tells her that she is their only hope. “We don’t trust anyone except Khabar Lahariya.”

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

The number of downloads of the NHS Covid-19 app has shrunk dramatically amid a “pingdemic” that is causing shortages of goods and workers, after former health secretary Jeremy Hunt warned last week that the government “risks losing social consent” for its test-and-trace programme if it does not allow fully vaccinated people to avoid isolation.
There were 43% fewer downloads of the NHS Covid-19 app in the week ending 30 June compared with the week ending 14 June, government data shows, while a record 689,313 people in England and Wales were contacted by the app and asked to self-isolate in the week to 12 July.

For just over a month now, Love Island (and therefore, Love Island discourse) has dominated the summer. Not since Take Me Out’s 2010s reign has a British reality dating show generated so much conversation, alternately heralded as the best thing on telly and condemned as the most controversial. As predictable as the fast fashion collaborations are the complaints, whether it be Tweeters drawing up petitions or viewers escalating their grumbles to Ofcom.
It goes without saying that Love Island, like any other reality show, is problematic. To date, the most complained about episode is from season four, when fan favourite Dani Dyer sobbed as she learned that the ex-girlfriend of her love interest Jack Fincham had joined the show. Ofcom received more than 2,500 complaints and the show was accused of “emotional manipulation”. And this week, after two years of forgoing the infamous postcard that caused such distress, it was brought back to spice up what has been a largely uneventful series. Producers showed images of castmate Teddy Soares kissing another woman during a challenge, despite spending most of his time in Casa Amor pining after Faye Winters. Watching Faye put her walls up once again, faced with the misrepresentation of his behaviour, was infuriating rather than entertaining.

Simone Biles has given us many groundbreaking performances. This week she has pushed the boundaries of sport once more. Not by expanding her already extraordinary technical expertise as a gymnast but by challenging the persistent, macho narrative around what Olympic success and sporting strength should look like.
Biles follows tennis players Naomi Osaka at the French Open and Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon, who are unafraid to speak up in the global spotlight and place mental heath on the same level as physical health. Sadly, all have had their integrity, sporting prowess and character questioned. Michael Phelps revealed the extraordinary pressures and mental health struggles that he faced in a recent documentary called The Weight of Gold: the title says it all. Amid the stacks of gold medals and trophies, it’s hard to dismiss Phelps, Osaka or Biles as “weak losers” (unless you’re a certain brand of tabloid commentator). That means we have to think again. Surely we have had enough warning shots to realise the scale of the mental health crisis in sport – one that is also a mirror for wider society. It’s going to take more than a few extra wellbeing advisers to address the issue.

China’s appointment of a new ambassador to the US has shone a light on the ongoing debate among analysts about how Beijing communicates with its biggest competitor, the future of its “wolf warrior” diplomacy and how Xi Jinping’s call to “tell a good China story” might work in practice.
The debate over the “wolf warrior” style – under which, as the Chinese ambassador to Sweden said on Swedish public radio in 2019, “we treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns” – comes amid a burst of positive publicity that delighted Beijing’s propaganda officials: the foreign coverage of the herd of 15 wandering Asian elephants in southern China that captured the country’s imagination and led Chinese vloggers to travel hundreds of miles to take selfies with them.

A Syrian doctor has been charged in Germany with crimes against humanity for allegedly torturing people in military hospitals in his homeland and killing one of them, German federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.
The federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe said in a statement that Alla Mousa, who came to Germany in 2015 and practised medicine before he was arrested last year, was accused of 18 counts of torturing people in military hospitals in the Syrian cities of Homs and Damascus. The allegations include charges that Mousa tried to make people infertile.

The UK, co-hosting the summit with Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, plans to raise funds for the Global Partnership for Education, from governments and donors. The UK government has promised £430m over the next five years.

The world is witnessing the emergence of more infectious variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, but a stuttering race to ensure equitable access to vaccines has seen a handful of countries streak ahead, immunising their own populations, leaving many of the world’s vulnerable people in their wake.
Communities are struggling with impatience and fatigue, which is understandable. However, easing basic public health measures such as wearing masks and social distancing risks fuelling transmission. In combination with more infectious variants and the “me first” attitude of some countries, people who are unvaccinated and those who have received only one dose are at increasing risk.

The former Norway midfielder – who won Olympic gold in 2000, the World Cup in 1995 and the Euros in 1993 and was an assistant coach with the US women’s national team from 2009 to 2012 – joined the England setup as a temporary assistant coach alongside the Canada international Rhian Wilkinson in January. With Phil Neville parting ways with the Football Association to become manager of Inter Miami shortly afterwards, Riise stepped up as interim England manager and then the FA turned to her to lead Team GB in Japan with Wilkinson as her No 2.

This does not simply mean the number of food banks has grown in recent years – there are now more than 1,300 such places in the Trussell Trust’s network, compared to fewer than 100 in 2010, as well as hundreds more independent ones – but also that these have opened the door for other types of donation centres, each set up by community groups and charities in response to growing need.

The video keeps getting removed from YouTube, but whenever it does, someone else uploads it again: jerky cameraphone footage of a man in a homemade T-shirt that reads Jesus Loves UK Garage, DJing at an Essex club in 2003. The crowd in Romford are going insane – the man is Todd Edwards, an American house producer whose rough-edged production style had exerted so much influence on the UK garage scene that he had become known as Todd the God – but the object of their worship looks, as he puts it now, “scared to death”: the smile on his face is weirdly fixed and unmoving, in a way that suggests not enjoyment, but terror.
He had, he explains today, never really DJ’d in a club before, certainly not in front of 1,500 people. Edwards had previously declined all entreaties to come to the UK, despite the fact that his music was vastly better known and more successful here than back home. Moreover, he had almost no idea what a UK garage club was like. His experience of clubbing had largely involved hanging around the booth at New York’s Sound Factory Bar, hoping that the resident DJ Little Louie Vega would play one of his tracks; a visit to Zanzibar, the Newark club where Tony Humphries had pioneered the original, gospel-influenced, American garage sound, had ended in disaster when Edwards’ car had been towed away.

We would like to hear from people in Tunisia who are affected by the current political situation – what are your concerns? Have you taken part in the protests last week? What is the political atmosphere where you live ?

Erasmus claims referee Nic Berry favoured Lions’ captain

World Rugby is under pressure to intervene after Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s director of rugby, launched another stinging attack on the refereeing of the opening Test of the British & Irish Lions series. Erasmus has also offered to step aside from the remaining two Tests if it delivers “fairer” treatment for the Springboks in Saturday’s second Test.
During an hour-long video containing 26 clips highlighting a range of decisions, Erasmus suggested the Australian referee, Nic Berry, and his assistants made several crucial mistakes which significantly influenced his side’s 22-17 defeat. He also raised eyebrows by alleging his World Cup-winning captain, Siya Kolisi, was shown less respect at key moments than his Lions counterpart, Alun Wyn Jones.

What can I make if my holiday kitchen is a dud?
Julia, Telford, Shropshire
“I once took a potato ricer with me to make mashed potato,” remembers Tommy Banks, chef-director of Yorkshire’s The Black Swan at Oldstead, Made in Oldstead and Roots. On coordinating its safe return after leaving it behind, his hosts asked him: “Who on earth takes a potato ricer with them on holiday?” A fair point, though self-catering kitchens can be strange places, where sweetcorn skewers are deemed essential while spatulas are MIA or relegated to a drawer you’ll most likely discover on the last day.
“When I’m cooking, I like to have certain things to hand,” says Roberta Hall-McCarron, chef-owner of The Little Chartroom in Edinburgh. “Packing everything up is a pain, but it will be better when you get there.” For Banks, that means a good knife and a decent frying pan: “There’s nothing worse than a paper-thin pan that’s going to burn everything,” he says. Maybe even more crucial, however, are a few basic ingredients: oil, salt and stock, say. Essentially, plan your meals ahead and equip accordingly.

The scene is a 1930s paddle steamer chugging down the Nile, aboard which a wealthy heiress has been shot: Peter Ustinov’s Hercule Poirot investigates and suspicion falls on a querulous American, Mrs Van Schuyler, played by Davis, who may have wanted to get her gnarled hands on the victim’s pearl necklace.

• ZZ Top bassist Dusty Hill dies aged 72
Dusty Hill was evidently used to being mistaken for someone else. Well, for one other person. In 2012, backstage at a strange festival in Maryland, I watched as drunk twentysomethings walked up to a man with a vast beard, eyes hidden behind shades. “Billy!” they shouted. “Billy, can I get a photo with you?” But Dusty Hill clearly didn’t like being mistaken for Billy Gibbons, who stood a few feet away from him on stage with ZZ Top for more than 50 years, and he walked away without a word.
Gibbons tended to be the focus of attention: he was the guitarist; he took most of the lead vocals; he was the band’s great and delightful eccentric. But Hill, who died in his sleep aged 72, was just as important. He sang lead or co-lead on several of ZZ Top’s best loved songs – his high, true tenor a contrast to Gibbons’ radioactive growl – and his bass tone was every bit as crucial to their sound as Gibbons’ guitar. And, perhaps even more importantly, the pair came as a double act, not just by looking so similar they could be mistaken for one another but also in the perfect, minimalist choreography of their stage show (“Low energy, high impact,” as Hill described it to me, later that afternoon in Maryland).

Back then, the effects of trauma weren’t exactly unknown, but they weren’t making headlines, either. Most of the information I found was on psychology websites, but it wasn’t until I went to the doctor and received my diagnosis that I fully understood what was happening to me. Public awareness of the condition was low – or at least, it wasn’t something that people spoke openly about. I felt very alone.

Five weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer, Corinne Singleton was declared to be in remission. She skipped out of the oncology ward that day, ready to make the most of her retirement. Little did she know that her health challenges were far from over. “To be honest,” says Singleton, five years later, “the cancer was a breeze compared with the lymphoedema.”
About a month into her recovery, Singleton, 60, noticed some unusual swelling of her upper thigh. “I just thought I must have banged it,” she says. When it persisted after two weeks, she realised, with a sinking feeling, what was the likely cause. She had learned about lymphoedema early on in her treatment for cancer, as a possible side effect of radiotherapy. “I remembered thinking: ‘I hope I don’t get that one’,” she says.

The new research builds upon what is known as the “social cost of carbon”, a monetary figure placed upon the damage caused by each ton of carbon dioxide emissions, by assigning an expected death toll from the emissions that cause the climate crisis.

‘Record-shattering’ heat becoming much more likely, says climate study

Mbeubeuss is one of the biggest rubbish tips in Africa and Senegal’s largest open cemetery for murdered children. In the past three years, the bodies of 32 infants have been recovered from the site by the waste-pickers who work there.
Looking at the high rate of infanticide in Senegal, it seems the main reasons for it are shame about pregnancy outside marriage and a loss of traditional support for young women.

Finland has dealt with the pandemic much better than a lot of other countries. It still has one of the lowest rates of both confirmed cases (about 103,851 at time of writing) and coronavirus-related deaths (currently 982) in Europe, a feat many have attributed to a strategy of rapid lockdowns and stringent travel restrictions.
It did all this in typical Finnish style: without shouting about it. Perhaps this quiet demeanour is related to the country’s deep connection with the natural world, where shouting usually isn’t necessary. More than 90% of Finland is either forest or water, and the country’s jokamiehenoikeus (right to roam) gives anyone living in or visiting Finland access to all that nature, including a lot of privately owned land.

Her father passed away in 2017, while she was shooting her debut film Dear Philadelphia. “This is my most vulnerable project because it’s specifically about a relationship and a person I miss. It felt like an honour to be able to spend time with all these different dads.” Though documenting children and other sensitive social groups is nothing new to Osubu, Fathers & Figures is her most honest series to date.

Americans will eat about 2bn chicken nuggets this year, give or take a few hundred million. This deep-fried staple is a way of profiting off the bits that are left after the breast, legs and wings are lopped off the 9 billion or so factory-farmed chickens slaughtered in the US every year. Like much else that is ubiquitous in contemporary life, the production of nuggets is controlled by a small group of massive companies that are responsible for a litany of social and ecological harms. And, like many of the commodities produced by this system, they are of dubious quality, cheap, appealing and easy to consume. Nuggets are not even primarily meat, but mostly fat and assorted viscera – including epithelium, bone, nerve and connective tissue – made palatable through ultra-processing. As the political economists Raj Patel and Jason Moore have argued, they are a homogenised, bite-size avatar of how capitalism extracts as much value as possible from human and nonhuman life and labour.
But if chicken nuggets are emblematic of modern capitalism, then they are ripe for disruption. Perhaps their most promising challenger is a radically different sort of meat: edible tissue grown in vitro from animal stem cells, a process called cellular agriculture. The sales pitch for the technology is classic Silicon Valley: unseat an obsolete technology – in this case, animals – and do well by doing good.

Graham Readfearn explains the fierce global effort to deny the impact of the climate crisis on a prized natural asset. This episode includes explicit language
The Great Barrier Reef is a habitat where global heating is not some far-off threat but a present-day catastrophe. Home to extraordinary biodiversity, it is about the size of Italy or Japan – and it has suffered three mass coral bleaching events since 2015, killing up to 50% of its shallow water coral, as a result of the climate crisis, with no reprieve from that process in sight.
That conclusion, supported by a wide scientific consensus, prompted a push to have Unesco, the UN’s science and culture organisation, to add the reef to its “in danger” list. It would have been the first time a world heritage site had been placed on the list primarily because of the effects of global heating. But last week the 21-country World Heritage Committee ignored Unesco’s scientific assessment and voted to reconsider the matter next year instead.

Doctors are warning that general practice clinics risk cracking under the pressure of “unsustainable” workloads unless the government ramps up the recruitment of medical staff and takes steps to reduce burnout.
The Royal College of GPs is calling on the government to introduce an emergency rescue package to shore up general practice clinics after the pandemic, including recruiting 6,000 more GPs and 26,000 additional support staff, such as nurses and receptionists, by 2024 as well as reducing paperwork and investing in £1bn worth of improvements to infrastructure and technology. Without these changes, patients will not receive the care they need, the college said.

The cast here is a winning one too, under the direction of Laurence Connor. Enlisting Alexandra Burke as the Narrator (she doubles up in other parts too) ensures a strong musical delivery from her central role, but she brings plenty besides her voice, from silky movements to minx-like touches. The only odd note is her costume – shiny leggings, sparkly trainers and high ponytail, which give her the look of an aerobics instructor.

A coroner has ruled that Andrew Devine, 55, who has died 32 years after suffering severe and irreversible brain damage at Hillsborough in 1989, was unlawfully killed, and that therefore he is legally the 97th victim of the disaster.
In a statement on Liverpool football club’s website announcing the news, Devine’s family, who have cared for him ever since he suffered the devastating crushing injuries at Hillsborough, said they welcomed the coroner’s ruling.

Adrian Lam says Liam Marshall was kicked in runup to try 

Sometimes it is simply about points, rather than performances. It would have been unreasonable to expect too much from Warrington here given that they have had just two training sessions since their last game more than three weeks ago, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak that has ravaged their first-team squad.
But while this was not a polished performance by any stretch of the imagination, it was one filled with resilience and spirit, two traits which could yet take Steve Price’s side a long way in this season’s title race. They remain adrift of the two leading clubs, Catalans and St Helens, but results like these could prove pivotal in securing as favourable a position as possible in the top six later this summer.

Celtic missed out on the group stages for a fourth year running as a 2-1 extra-time defeat by Midtjylland consigned them to a 3-2 aggregate loss and a Europa League qualifier against Czech side Jablonec.
Celtic have made five summer signings but two of them are in quarantine and another two, young former Sheffield Wednesday pair Osaze Urhoghide and Liam Shaw, did not get off the bench in Denmark. The only new arrival to feature was 19-year-old Liel Abada, who could not build on his goalscoring debut in a quiet display.

Employees of Activision Blizzard, the video game company that produces World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, staged a walkout Wednesday morning to call for better working conditions as the company faces allegations of a “frat boy” culture and severe harassment and discrimination against female workers.
The California department of fair employment and housing (DFEH) filed a lawsuit against the company last week after a two-year investigation found widespread sexual harassment, retaliation and discrimination and that the video game maker “fostered a sexist culture” in which female employees earn less than males doing similar work.

After the government announced plans to recognise vaccination status if people were fully jabbed in the US and most of Europe, Labour said it could make the country more susceptible to being overwhelmed by another Delta-like variant.

Wearing his typical wide-brimmed straw hat, Pedro Castillo promised to make sweeping changes to the country in his inaugural speech, he paid homage to Peru’s indigenous people and teachers and vowed to combat corruption, rein in monopolies and boost public spending on education and health.

As well as bringing fresh hope in the fight against one of the world’s biggest killers, the study lays the foundations for further trials of gene-drive technology, which could mean self-destroying mosquitoes being released into the wild within 10 years.

But the Amanar, as dangerous and difficult as it is, always has been one of her most trusty skills.
So when she completely lost her way in the middle of its two and a half twists during the women’s team final at the Tokyo Games, it was clear something beyond the ordinary was wrong.

Strength, resilience and determination make sportswomen champions in the field. The same qualities are ensuring that more of them get there. Banned from the first modern Olympics, in 1896, only 22 competed among almost 1,000 athletes at the next games in Paris. This year Britain, the US and China have all sent more women than men to Tokyo, and overall, the number of female competitors has almost reached parity with male at last, at 48.8%.
The Games are a rare sporting realm in which women come very close to equality. Most gold medallists will receive the same financial reward from their country whether male or female. Over the years, female Olympians such as Nadia Comăneci and Jackie Joyner-Kersee have enjoyed instant name recognition and drawn spectators, just as male athletes have. Women’s events are valued in their own right.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution is a historic embodiment of that ethos. Its volunteer mariners do not interrogate the motives that led people to the sea before fishing them out. Nor should they. The RNLI’s founding mission is to help without discrimination, and it has made clear that it will not adapt that code to satisfy political frustrations at the volume of migrants attempting entry to Britain by boat. That traffic (though far lower than elsewhere) has, inevitably, meant lifeboat crews sometimes stepping in where the coastguard has not reached imperilled vessels. Those cases account for as many as half of the RNLI’s Channel launches.

I can hardly do a proper cartwheel, so I’m hesitant to opine on Simone Biles’s decision to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympics this week, telling the press and the world: “I have to focus on my mental health.” I can’t stay silent, though, because I know she’s not alone.
As a former college football player, I can imagine the psychological price Olympians pay to squeeze every ounce of greatness into a tiny window of life. As a Black man raised by a cadre of women, I can imagine the tax Black women pay because of our national commitment to “trust” them, which really just means “let them do all the work.” Or, in the case of Simone Biles, “let her put the whole country on her back”.

The unsubstantiated allegations about Wi Spa in LA’s Koreatown neighborhood quickly spread from social media to rightwing forums to far-right news sites to Fox News, and were distorted by anti-transgender groups across multiple countries.

Fin-to-fin synchronised swimming, thought likely to be part of courtship, has been seen in groups of basking sharks for the first time. Video cameras attached temporarily to the sharks gave scientists an unprecedented view of their hitherto secret underwater world.
The gentle giants are usually solitary creatures and virtually nothing is known about their breeding behaviour. The researchers also recorded one shark shooting out above the water, the first time a full breaching has been captured from the shark’s point of view. This may also be part of wooing a mate, perhaps by showing off the fish’s size.

I have long thought that incompetence was not a credible explanation for the government’s more extreme actions during the pandemic, so I welcome the article by two sociologists, Jana Bacevic and Linsey McGoey, which says that the government constructed a facade of incompetence, behind which it could manipulate events (The British government’s Covid strategy was never designed to manage the virus, 27 July). In particular, it initially refused the help of existing public health expertise in test and trace while liaising with Serco, Deloitte and others to set up a system (branded “NHS”) that channelled huge amounts of public money to private firms. This “illusion of incompetence” continues to allow the government to avoid responsibility for mismanaging the pandemic, while benefiting its cronies financially. The fact that the government is often in fact incompetent helps, of course, to foster the illusion.
Jeanne Warren
Garsington, Oxford
• Jana Bacevic and Linsey McGoey describe Dido Harding’s response to the spread of the virus and her argument that no one could have predicted that it would mutate, and therefore no one could be held responsible for the surge of infections. If Dido Harding had read Pale Rider, Laura Spinney’s account of the 1919 flu epidemic, published to coincide with the centenary, she would have known that in its second wave that virus killed mainly young people, having mutated from one that killed mainly older people. Yet again, those who do not take any lessons from the past are condemned to repeat it.

That dream died cruelly in its swiftness; a fall on his solitary routine in the qualifying round.

In his stead, Daiki Hashimoto has risen to become the Olympic men’s all-around champion at just 19 years old and after a breathless, tight final in which 0.4 pts separated the top three spots.

DC’s new Suicide Squad movie announces itself as different from the coolly received first film from 2016 simply by adding “The” to the title, maybe sneakily trying for an unacknowledged rebrand or reboot. James Gunn, also in charge of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, is brought on board as director and co-writer. This second Squad outing (if you don’t count last year’s standalone Harley Quinn adventure Birds of Prey) is a long, loud, often enjoyable and amusing film that blitzes your eyeballs and eardrums and covers all the bases. There is Guardians-style comedy mixing humans and talking animals, there is freaky violence – including what I have to say is a gruesomely impressive interior-anatomical shot, showing a knife plunging into the still-beating heart – and there is colossal CGI spectacle for the final act in which a giant thing runs rampant in a city, while the gang look up at it; a trope that has become almost legally mandatory for superhero movies.
Viola Davis once again brings a touch of class to the Suicide Squad franchise as the chillingly manipulative security chief Amanda Waller who now springs supervillain Bloodsport (Idris Elba) from jail so that he can head up an elite new crew of misfits, desperadoes and undesirables. These include Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the ironically belligerent Peacemaker (John Cena), King Shark – a great big talking shark in Hulk-ish stretchy shorts – voiced by Sylvester Stallone, Ratcatcher II (Daniela Melchior), who commands an army of rats wherever she goes, and Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), who fires molten polka-dots at the enemy, revving himself up for the task by imagining that this is his overbearing mother. There is also a kind of B-team of Squadders whose job is to be hilariously expendable.

A rare and ancient tablet showing part of the epic of Gilgamesh, which had been acquired by Christian arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby for display in its museum of biblical artefacts, has been seized by the US government.
The Department of Justice (DoJ) alleges that the 3,600-year-old “Gilgamesh Dream Tablet”, which originated in a region that is now part of Iraq, was acquired in 2003 by an American antiquities dealer, “encrusted with dirt and unreadable”, from the family member of a London coin dealer. Once it had arrived in the US, and been cleaned, experts realised that it showed a portion of the Gilgamesh epic, one of the world’s oldest works of literature, in the Akkadian language.

The Queen’s consent procedure, which critics have called anti-democratic, has been used repeatedly by the monarch in recent decades to secretly lobby for changes to proposed UK legislation before it is passed by parliament.

Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob) – a prominent separatist movement proscribed in Nigeria – fled the country in 2017 while on bail after soldiers attacked his family home in Abia.

I am all for men crying; I do a lot of it myself. If we leave onions out of it, there are only two kinds of crying. There’s crying because you’re happy and crying because you’re sad. I would suggest the latter represents the original purpose of crying, but the former is very good, too. Tom Daley’s top-of-the-podium tears, running down his face and dampening his mask, were a joy to see. Perhaps the moisture in the air of the aquatic centre lends itself to this kind of thing, because James Guy then raised the blubbing bar by sobbing with joy at a teammate’s gold before going on to shed more water after winning his own.
This is all healthy stuff, indicating a good deal of emotional articulacy, but for me the gold standard in the sporting crying game is to bawl it out good and loud when you’ve lost, rather than won. It seems more acceptable for women to do this than it is for men. Our female taekwondists have been particularly strong on this. I felt like crying with Jade Jones when it all fell apart, and so did her teammate looking on, Bianca Walkden, who shed more tears than Jade herself. So while we had blokes crying with joy for themselves and each other, the women were brave enough to do the same in their shared despair.

Last Thursday, the Police Federation passed a vote of no confidence in the home secretary after the announcement that rank-and-file officers in England and Wales would receive a 0% pay increase – a real-terms cut after 18 months on the frontline of the pandemic. On Monday, new figures revealed a mental health crisis plaguing rank-and-file officers. Now, with the announcement of a “crime-beating plan” that offers little support for officers, but plenty of gimmicks with which to pepper political speeches, the relationship between the force and the government is at risk of being severed beyond repair.
The police should not be above criticism; their mistakes have been numerous, and the implications on public trust profound. It is important to acknowledge where policing has failed, and whom it has failed. And I say that not as an armchair pundit, but as a former chief superintendent and a staunch supporter of rank-and-file officers.

Until the last possible moment, Rob Holding held out a sliver of hope that the most gruelling of years might yet be extended further. Anyone grasping for positives from Arsenal’s season might have cited his increasingly consistent, mature performances at the heart of their defence but they were not enough to earn a first senior England call-up for Euro 2020. “When the squads were being announced I had my eye on it,” he says. “You never know, so I was looking. It didn’t happen for me this time but that’s not going to deter me or make me feel it’s never going to.”
Arsenal’s defensive record in 2020-21 was bettered only by Manchester City and Chelsea, although that was never going to offer much succour after a campaign of such barren reward. If it could not exactly be described as a breakthrough year for Holding, it was certainly a progression. He had never quite nailed down a regular spot, a situation not helped by anterior cruciate ligament surgery late in 2018, and appeared likely to depart on loan last autumn. But he convinced Mikel Arteta enough to give him 39 starts, 30 in the league, and a new contract in January suggested little appetite from either party to move on.

But on that same day, a State of the Black Union conference was taking place in Virginia. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, told the gathering: “I wish Obama had announced here ’cos Lincoln did not free us. The abolitionist movement freed us. We’ve got to quit giving the wrong people credit for our history.”

The ancient Palestinian village of Lifta sits on a quiet hillside minutes from Jerusalem’s bustling modern centre. Abandoned when its residents fled during the 1948 war, it has been left unchanged – frozen in time – ever since.
Today, however, its overgrown domed stone houses with arched windows, built during the early Ottoman Empire and resting on even older ruins dating back to the Iron Age, are at risk of being demolished to make way for a luxurious resort of villas, hotels and shops.

Ten years after the revolution that triggered the Arab spring, Tunisia, long regarded as one of the few democratic transition success stories to come out of that era, has been plunged into crisis after its president, Kais Saied, suspended parliament and lifted the immunity of politicians for 30 days, citing a provision in Tunisia’s 2014 post-revolution constitution.
That has prompted accusations from Ennahda, often described as a moderate Islamist party, that Saied has staged a coup.

Myanmar is at risk of becoming a super-spreader Covid state that fuels outbreaks across the region, the UN special rapporteur for the country has warned as he urged the security council to call for a ceasefire.
The south-east Asian country is facing its most severe outbreak yet, on top of a deep political and economic crisis brought about by the military coup in February. Its vaccination programme has ground to a standstill, testing has collapsed, and government hospitals are barely functioning.

After 18 months of lockdown and seeing nothing but buildings and city life, I needed to get away. I’d dreamed of visiting the Outer Hebrides for years and decided to take the plunge in May 2021, walking and camping solo along the Hebridean Way – my first time camping as an adult. I woke up to stunning beach views and I loved the freedom. But it wasn’t always easy: some nights I had to hold my tent up against the winds at 3am, and carrying all my kit on my back was horrendous at times. But I wouldn’t change a thing. My aim for the trip was to get back in touch with my homeland and endure the camping – but it turns out I love camping! It won’t be long before I’m on my way back to the Outer Hebrides – but with a lighter rucksack and a better inflatable mat this time. Bev Mackenzie, freelance copywriter, Bristol

In the mountains of Guerrero in south-west Mexico, there is a small town called Alcozacán. Violence is common in the area, which is strategically important for the drug trade. Violence has increased all over Mexico over the past few years, but some places including Guerrero have been particularly badly affected.
The people of Alcozacán and its surrounding towns became more and more angry about the criminal groups terrorising their communities and what they saw as a lack of protection from the government. They felt abandoned, so formed community defence forces to protect themselves from the gangs and drug traffickers. In Alcozacán, there are no police as we know them. It is ruled – or taken care of, depending on your point of view – by a force made up of local people.

Returning to carefree adolescence might sound like an exciting and sexy proposition – parties, kissing, no hangovers, no debt – but wasn’t most of that time spent in utter boredom? Wasn’t being a teenager tedious with brief, if intense, highs? The rules, the expectations, the parents, the fact you’re not a child and not yet an adult, the constant sensation that you are always missing out on something.
As I recall, those pimply years comprised extended periods of school and do-nothing days with the occasional freezing night spent watching older lads talk to girls. But I’d argue it was within that tiresome fug that the lasting stuff occurred, and many of our treasured teenage memories resulted from nothing particularly exciting happening: bored, you did something mad with your mates. Or you did something mad to yourself. Or you sent something mad to somebody else in a hope they might feel the same. Or you let a horse into a house party.

Here we are, a year on from the unprecedented mass mobilisation of people at Black Lives Matter protests across the UK and numerous discussions about racial disparity in the criminal justice system have taken place. Yet it is clear the government has learned nothing in the past 12 months. Absolutely zilch.

Sajda Mughal was on her daily commute to her dream job in City recruitment on the morning her world was turned upside down. It was a July day in London, 16 years ago, one that throbbed with the summer heat, and Mughal was running late for work. She ducked into Turnpike Lane tube station in north London, as she usually did, and boarded the Piccadilly Line train. The one thing she did differently that morning was not getting into the first carriage of the train. “Every day until 6 July 2005, I would sit in that first carriage. Maybe it was a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder, or maybe I knew the first carriage was where I’d get a seat. But, on that particular day, I was late, so I rushed on to the platform and, instead of doing my usual thing, I just got on.”
This detail became all-important when, a few stops later, at King’s Cross, the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay got on to Mughal’s train, boarding the first carriage, and blew himself up. “Twenty-six people died, most of whom were in the first carriage,” she says.

Plant-based ice-cream, like so much else in the vegan world, has come on leaps and bounds in both range and quality in recent years as the market for it has grown, but many commercial varieties still replace dairy and eggs with a long list of perfectly harmless, yet still less than enticing ingredients such as fully refined soybean oil. Without stabilisers, the homemade kind may not last quite as well in the freezer but, frankly, it doesn’t need to: it’s unlikely to be in there long.
This recipe makes a virtue of coconut’s flavour, as well as of its natural creaminess, though you could also use it as a base for other ingredients, folding in fruit puree or chocolate chips after churning, say, or adding the likes of cocoa powder or peppermint extract to the base itself. Richer than a sorbet, lighter and cleaner than standard ice-cream, it’s really not just for vegans.

We have zero years before climate and ecological breakdown, because it’s already here. We have zero years left to procrastinate. The longer we wait to act, the worse the floods, fires, droughts, famines and heatwaves will get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In combining both pummelling impact and nimble speed, Jordison defied his short stature to become a hulking master of rhythm – and the finest metal drummer of his era

• Joey Jordison, founding Slipknot drummer, dies at age 46
To better understand the magnitude of former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison’s death at the age of 46 requires us to first recall the loss of another drummer. Praised universally for his technical wizardry and powerhouse style, Rush’s legendary Neil Peart died in January 2020 – a watershed moment for rock drumming. Eighteen months later, we now face the heavy metal equivalent.
While there’s a strong case for Slipknot as the greatest metal band of their generation, Jordison was almost definitively the finest metal drummer of his era. Born in the band’s native Des Moines, Iowa, Jordison picked up his first pair of drumsticks aged eight. He co-founded the nine-piece Slipknot in 1995 and spent 18 years behind the kit for the megastars. Slipknot developed their own lore: there were the obvious nods to horror in the terrifying face masks and boiler suits they wore for live performances, and each member was assigned their own number. Tellingly, Jordison was No 1.

The Dutch cyclist dominated an experienced field on her way to winning gold in the women’s individual time trial at the Tokyo Games on Wednesday.

Swerving off course, veering out of its lane at the last. Sport loves a metaphor. As Britain’s Olympic rowers reeled off a series of wholehearted but ultimately disappointing finishes at the Tokyo 2020 waterfront it was hard to avoid the sense the men’s coxless four had dished up their own slightly hammy, if unavoidably persuasive image in its final race.
By the end of Wednesday’s programme one thing did seem uncomfortably clear. The choice to allow Jürgen Gröbler to leave a year before these Games, a decision made by men who can only guess vaguely at Gröbler’s depth of fine-point expertise, looks as rash and as damaging now as it did at the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the pandemic wanes, bold ideas and big investment could create a new economic miracle for the 21st century
Economic history isn’t like normal history – it doesn’t repeat itself as farce and it doesn’t rhyme. Technology moves on, political and legal systems develop, debtors turn into creditors and vice versa. But some economic structures remain stubbornly the same. As Karl Marx said, we make our own history, but not in circumstances of our own choosing. Using the past to guide decisions in the present requires understanding what has endured and what has changed, and taking a sober view of our history – not simply replicating the supposed golden ages of the past.
For that reason, we shouldn’t aim to repeat the “roaring 20s” just because the decade starts with a two and we’re (hopefully) coming to the end of a pandemic similar to the Spanish flu. Despite the name, the roaring 20s were not all that great for most of the population. Growth was sluggish and the falling prices of consumer goods concealed widening inequality by making everyone feel rich, much like the decade preceding the 2008 financial crisis. In the 20th century as in the 21st, a period of growth ended in a financial crash, a lost decade, the rise of rightwing populism and leading countries turning their back on trading blocs.

The city of Oslo was built on wealth generated by the North Sea, which for decades has produced billions of barrels of oil and gas. But Oslo now hopes to lead Norway’s transformation from one of the world’s largest exporters of fossil fuels to a global green pioneer.
For Raymond Johansen, Oslo’s governing mayor, helping to lead global efforts to tackle the climate crisis is both a pragmatic economic response to Norway’s declining fossil fuel industries, and a moral obligation to provide solutions for a crisis it helped to create.

Carved largely by hand into a craggy, granite cliff-face, the dizzying outdoor venue on the south coast of Cornwall looks magnificent in the summer sunshine. Tiers of subtropical foliage splash colour throughout the landscape and weathered concrete seats bearing the titles of past shows rise abruptly from the stage. The ocean, 100ft below, looks an enticing shade of turquoise.

It was in Stansted airport’s Pink Elephant car park that I realised all the adults were going home. It was early January 2007 and we had just returned from Mum’s funeral in Derry. I watched as uncles and aunts ambled over to their cars, and there the three of us were left: me, 25, my girlfriend, Jade, 26, and my little brother, Declan, who had just turned 16. I was now his legal guardian.
This moment shouldn’t have been a surprise. Mum had been ill, on and off, for eight years and, in her last 12 months, had made plans for what would happen if she didn’t make it. It was a no-brainer when she asked: “What about Declan?” “I’ll look after him,” I instantly replied.

There are some things every Glastonbury festivalgoer is guaranteed to experience. You’ll lose yourself in the endless fields and pathways (and your tent at least once). You will plot the perfect itinerary to take in your favourite artists and each area of the site, but only see a fraction of it all. And it will definitely rain.
This year, though, thanks to Covid, the Glasto experience is rather different. A mini online-only version of the festival ran in June (last year was cancelled), but owner Michael Eavis and family are welcoming people to Worthy Farm this summer by, for the first time, opening it as a campsite. For six weeks, visitors can stay in one of 750 pre-erected tents dotted across the site. There’s room for a total of 3,500 visitors at any one time – a smattering compared with the 200,000 of a festival weekend. Gone are the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, the music and the welly-stealing mud. Instead, there are resident cows (it’s a working farm), free children’s activities and a vibe so relaxed you could actually get some sleep, even with little ones.

Range anxiety hits hard on the A9 in the Highlands of Scotland. For the uninitiated, this is the fear that an electric vehicle (EV) won’t reach its destination before running out of power. I’m driving through some of Britain’s loveliest landscape – mountains, rivers, lochs and firths – but I hardly notice. I’m focused hard – on the road in front, but mainly on two numbers on the dashboard. One is how far it is in miles to where I’m going; the other is the range in miles remaining in the battery. Sometimes, especially on downhill stretches when what is known as “regenerative braking” means the battery is getting charged, I tell myself it’s going to be OK, I’ll make it. But going uphill the range plummets. Squeaky bum time.
Plus, I’ve read Michel Faber’s Under the Skin. I know what happens to men stranded on the A9. To range anxiety add the fear of being processed and eaten by aliens.

To a casual observer, Joe Biden’s victory in the last US presidential election, coupled with Democratic success in the Senate and the House, might have seemed to turn the page on the Donald Trump era and consign his hardline policy agenda to the past. But a huge amount of power in the US resides in its 50 state legislatures, and Republicans won a clear majority in 30 of them. In large parts of the US they are now using that power to enact a policy agenda that many observers view as being far more extreme than many voters would have supported. So why are they going ahead anyway?
Rachel Humphreys speaks to David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington bureau chief, about the politics that lie behind that move to the right, and how in the era of coronavirus it will further deepen the sense that there are two vastly different Americas. Smith reflects on what threat to Biden’s agenda the state Republicans will present and whether their strategy of appeasing their base could pave the way for a new Trump run at the presidency in 2024.

Plans to significantly open up international travel are expected to be announced on Wednesday, with UK ministers poised to let people who have been fully vaccinated in the US and EU avoid quarantine if arriving from amber list countries.
The move would benefit millions of people by finally letting them be reunited with family and friends based in the UK, as well as businesses in the aviation and tourism sectors that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has hit out at accusations it is operating a “migrant taxi service” by rescuing people at risk of dying in the water as they cross the Channel in small boats, which the charity says is its moral and legal duty.
Responding to accusations from Nigel Farage that it is facilitating illegal immigration, the volunteer lifeboat charity said it was “very proud” of its humanitarian work and it would continue to respond to coastguard callouts to rescue at-risk Channel migrants in line with its legal duty under international maritime law.

The 120-page strategy, led by the Department for Work and Pensions, is intended as the first step in an annual process by which all departments will be assessed on how well their policies help disabled people.

More than one in three middle-aged British adults are suffering from at least two chronic health conditions, including recurrent back problems, poor mental health, high blood pressure, diabetes and high-risk drinking, according to research that warned that health in midlife is on the decline.
The study of “generation X” adults born in 1970 found that those who grew up in poorer families were 43% more likely to have multiple long-term health conditions than their peers from wealthier households. Those who had been overweight or obese as children, who had lower birthweight and who had experienced mental ill-health as teenagers were also at increased risk of poor health in midlife.

And so to the latest documentary from Channel 4’s flagship current affairs strand, Dispatches, an unflinching report in which, similarly, there is not one bit that is nice. The customarily succinct and harrowing hour is titled India’s Rape Scandal and follows two of the most high-profile of the unimaginably brutal rapes that are becoming notorious in the country. One rape is reported to the police every 15 minutes in India, yet it is estimated that more than 90% of such assaults go unreported.

Employees already have the right to request flexible hours, but Labour says it would widen the definition of flexible working and give employers a legal responsibility to accommodate it unless they can show it is not workable.

Yes they have, Harvey – and in a variety of sports, too. We have already covered footballers at the Winter Olympics so we’re going to stick to the summer Games. Here’s Graeme Park with a former Welsh international you wouldn’t want to mess with competing in Japan on Wednesday. “I would nominate Lauren Price, who has earned international caps for Wales and won world kickboxing titles. She has already won a Commonwealth gold in boxing and is at Tokyo 2020 as the current No 1 middleweight boxer.”

A planned £6.3bn takeover of Morrisons could be at risk after the supermarket’s largest shareholder said they were likely to turn it down.
Silchester Asset Management, which owns a 15% stake in the UK’s fourth largest supermarket, said it was “not inclined to support” the 252p a share bid from a consortium led by US investment group Fortress backed by the billionaire Koch family.

Ken Clarke has been criticised by families affected by the infected blood inquiry for displaying “contempt” in his evidence after he showed a reluctance to answer questions.
Lord Clarke, who was a Conservative health minister from 1982 to 1985 and health secretary from 1988 to 1990, appeared to become irritated with the level of detail being examined by the lead counsel, Jenni Richards QC. 
At one point, he asked: “Why do we have to go through such meticulous detail through who said what when, when did he change his mind?” He added that it was “interesting” but “pretty pointless”. 
Further protestations from Clarke led the chair of the inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, to state that it was up to him to “ultimately determine” what questions were relevant. He said: “I think the relevance ultimately, Lord Clarke, is for me to determine. If I think the questions are unhelpful, then I will indicate that. 
“But at the moment, it would be helpful to me, I think, and we may get on a little bit more quickly if we just deal with the questions as they come and leave the motive or the purpose of asking the questions to counsel.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many voters think the government handles crime badly. Unworkable but tough-sounding punishments won’t change their minds.
Boris Johnson was a journalist who wanted to be prime minister. Now in Downing Street, he appears happiest when supplying headlines for the rightwing press. On Sunday, his plan to “blitz crime” was on the front page of the Sunday Express. On Monday, his home secretary was telling readers of the Daily Mail that she’ll make “yobs clean the streets”. At best, the government’s proposals are an irrelevance to tackling crime or making people feel safer. More likely, they will create perverse incentives and make a bad situation worse.
The policies fail on their own terms. Chain gangs are not a good way of deterring criminals. They have not stopped them in the US. This silly stunt will stigmatise a generation of offenders. There is good evidence that stop and search has minimal effects on crime levels, so why persist with a tactic that lowers trust levels? Tagging those released from prison might help reduce recidivism rates. But why devote resources to tagging burglars and not violent offenders?

In his victory speech following a third successive election triumph in 2018, Viktor Orbán told jubilant supporters that the result gave voters “the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary”. For over a decade now, Hungary’s prime minister has skilfully galvanised his political base by cultivating a siege mentality. Three years ago, Muslim migrants were depicted as the enemies at the gates, whose entry would undermine Christian values and traditions. Other targets of choice have included George Soros, NGOs and, the Guardian’s recent Pegasus revelations appear to suggest, critical journalists placed under digital surveillance.
A new election requires a new threat. As Hungary emerges from the pandemic, Mr Orbán and his Fidesz party have entered campaigning mode ahead of a spring poll that is expected to be extremely close. Their baleful gaze has alighted on Hungary’s LGBT+ population and its potential to lead the young astray. Last month, MPs passed a law that prohibits depicting or promoting LGBT+ content to under-18s in Hungary’s schools and the media. The new legislation will heavily restrict the portrayal of LGBT+ people in the arts and entertainment, and elsewhere. Critics have compared it to Russia’s 2013 law against “gay propaganda”, which was duly followed by a disturbing increase in violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

Two days after Tunisia’s stumbling democracy ground to a halt, the streets of the country’s capital were quiet, even indifferent on Tuesday, with the presence of army troops near a TV station one of the few symbols of a new and unsettling normal.
Protesters who had raged on Sunday before President Kais Saied sacked the county’s prime minister and suspended parliament were absent from sites that days before had been febrile hubs of discontent. Instead, passersby seemed to go about their business caring little about the gravity of the moment. In some parts of Tunis, the mood was almost celebratory.

The study, led by the University of Glasgow, found that efforts to shield the most vulnerable did not prevent substantial levels of infection in the most high-risk groups, with many patients succumbing to the virus.

About 150,000 aged care workers provide care to about 1 million older Australians in their own homes across the country, but the government revealed on Friday it still has no dedicated plan for vaccinating home care staff and has given the issue little focus.

Tony McGrath, who has died aged 80 of acute myeloid leukaemia, was the celebrated Observer photographer whose images of starving children helped to alert the world to the famine in Ethiopia that gave rise to Live Aid.
His heartbreaking picture of a young child, emaciated and dressed in rags, was made into a poster for charity and won McGrath the photograph of the year accolade in the British press awards in 1984. The following year, Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concerts galvanised people worldwide to give tens of millions of pounds to the cause.

Trainer apologises, Aidan O’Brien’s Twinkle promoted to first

There were chaotic scenes following a two-year-old fillies’ maiden at the Galway Festival on Tuesday evening after Alizarine, apparently a 4-1 winner on debut for trainer Jessica Harrington, was disqualified when she “could not be positively identified post-race”. This, it soon transpired, was because “Alizarine” was in fact Aurora Princess, a three-year-old filly due to run in a handicap later on the card.
Harrington later apologised for the mix-up, which was discovered before a “winner all right” message – the Irish equivalent of “weighed in” – had been issued to make the result official for betting purposes. The initial placings were later revised, with Aidan O’Brien’s Twinkle, the 5-4 favourite, promoted to first place.

Tony Abbott, the former prime minister of Australia recruited by Johnson to advise on post-Brexit trade, said he was heartened by a review being launched into the takeover of Welsh microchip manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia and suggested it meant the process could be paused.

Great Britain’s Bianca Walkden said she felt “a little bit robbed” of the chance to win a silver or gold medal in taekwondo at the Olympics, saying it was “soul-crushing” to have to fight for third place.
Walkden overcame the agony of her last-second defeat in the Olympic semi-final to take bronze in the women’s +67kg category with a 7-3 victory over Poland’s Aleksandra Kowalczuk on the final day of the competition. Speaking after the fight, the 29-year-old told the BBC she believed her semi-final opponent, South Korea’s Lee Da-bin, should have been penalised for a grab before she landed her winning crescent kick in the last seconds of the fight.

I’ve stood on picket lines in support of junior doctors during the Jeremy Hunt years and am in total support of pay increases for all medical and non-medical NHS workers (Threat of nurses’ strike over 3% pay award for NHS staff, 21 July). Whenever pay scales are quoted, however, they invariably refer to medical pay grades and don’t highlight the harsh reality of low pay for other workers who represent the essential cogs in the NHS machine.
Along with cleaners ensuring the safety of all areas, and porters transporting seriously ill patients and taking the dead to the mortuary, there is rarely a mention of admin and clerical workers, who book clinics, liaise with sick and stressed patients when appointments are cancelled at short notice, chase up no-shows, arrange hospital transport etc.

Having read that even Big Tobacco is now apparently willing to fall on its sword for the sake of our children’s future, or whatever (Tobacco firm Philip Morris calls for ban on cigarettes within decade, 25 July), I wish to put forward that the simplest way to approach this, instead of endlessly trying to warn people off the cigs with public health campaigns, would be to ban the sale of tobacco to anyone born after 2005.
This would prevent the uptake of smoking by a new cohort of young people, while tobacco products could remain available for another decade in which existing smokers would have ample opportunity to curb their addictions. A flat cohort ban like this would also make ID checks quicker (no maths involved), and harder to falsify, as the age discrepancy of new smokers would become more obvious over time.

A seductive encounter with past and present at the Olympic city shows that Tokyo practically invented modern art


Love hotels and cross-dressers make Tokyo’s nightlife eye-popping – and that’s just in 18th-century woodblock prints. The Ashmolean’s seductive overview of the Olympic city’s art sets these classics alongside images of contemporary Tokyo to create a thrilling and informative encounter with one of the world’s great art capitals.
Past and present meet for a sultry encounter in the night. A wall is lit up by Mika Ninagawa’s intensely coloured photos of blue- and pink-haired clubbers. They are so now – yet close by in the same gallery is a painted scroll from the 1600s that is just as provocative. It depicts the pleasure quarter of Edo, as Tokyo was then called, which became Japan’s capital when the Tokugawa shoguns united the country in the 17th century. It was famous for its pleasure quarter, “the floating world”, and the new art genre it inspired – ukiyo-e, “pictures of the floating world”. In the scroll, samurai warriors are seen visiting courtesans. But samurai were banned from the pleasure quarter so they wear straw hats pulled down to hide their faces. The comically phallic swords peeping out from their robes give them away.

The last time the British & Irish Lions lost a Test series having taken an initial 1-0 lead was in Australia 20 years ago. They had smashed the Wallabies 29-13 in Brisbane and were 11-6 up at half-time in the second Test in Melbourne, courtesy of two Jonny Wilkinson penalties and a try by Neil Back. One nasty, well-documented injury to Richard Hill and a costly interception try later and the outcome ended up being very different.
That is why Warren Gatland will be stressing to his players this week that complacency must be avoided. Given how ominous the situation was looking for the visitors at half-time in the first Test, his squad will already understand just how quickly things can change. South Africa are going to come at them ferociously hard on Saturday because, frankly, they have no other option.

Democracy depends on an equality of arms. If governments acquire political weapons unavailable to their opponents, they become harder to dislodge. They now possess so many that I begin to wonder how an efficient autocracy, once established, might ever again be overthrown.
The Pegasus spyware, whose widespread use by governments the Guardian has helped reveal, is just the latest variety of asymmetric force. The ability to peer into someone’s life from a distance, to track their every movement, word and intention, grants autocrats an unprecedented power. It turns us into informants against ourselves. No one subject to this spying can now plan, however peacefully and democratically, to replace a government without those plans being known in advance and in all likelihood thwarted.

The Jungle Cruise theme-park ride is a riverboat trip that Disneyland visitors have been queuing up for since the 1950s: an old-timey craft travelling down an artificial jungle river, with a jolly captain pointing out animatronic animals lurching out of the artificial undergrowth. Now it’s been adapted into a blandly inoffensive piece of generic entertainment: screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who once gave us Bad Santa and I Love You Phillip Morris) have mashed up The African Queen with Raiders of the Lost Ark, and with what I admit is a surreal splash of Aguirre, Wrath of God.
It’s lively enough for the first 20 minutes. The year is 1916, and Emily Blunt plays Lily Houghton, a haughty yet idealistic British scientist, much patronised by the male establishment in London. She imperiously hires a riverboat in Brazil to find the much-rumoured “Tree of Life” somewhere in the jungle. Its captain is a cynical-with-a-heart-of-gold rogue called Frank Wolff, man-mountainishly played by Dwayne Johnson. After the traditional meet-cute, their growing romance plays off the comedy turn provided by Jack Whitehall, playing the other passenger: Lily’s foppish, neurotic younger brother MacGregor. At one stage, Whitehall’s prissy, wussy Englishman explains to Dwayne Johnson that he is gay – or rather, he says something indirect about being not as other men, and the subject is never raised again, Edwardian reticence dovetailing nicely with Disney family values. It is a stereotype that Walt himself might have recognised, while also approving of the obvious heterosexuality of Frank with his muscles, boots and sailor’s cap.

Sorry, boys, but it’s all your fault. Melting ice caps, flash floods, rising sea levels: men are to blame for the lot of it. Please don’t drown the messenger, I’m just relaying the results of a Swedish study that found that men’s spending habits cause 16% more climate-heating emissions than women’s. The biggest difference seems to be that men spend more money on petrol. Another big difference: the men surveyed bought more meat than women. So this is the way the world ends, eh? Not with a bang, but with blokes eating too many burgers.
I don’t know how many studies published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology go viral, but this paper has had an enormous amount of traction. Of course, this is largely because its findings leant themselves to delicious clickbait such as Men Are Worse for Climate Change Than Women Because They Love Meat and Cars. To be fair, the study didn’t lean into gender war territory in the way you would expect based on the headlines it generated. Gender wasn’t even mentioned in the paper’s title, which was “Shifting expenditure on food, holidays, and furnishings could lower greenhouse gas emissions by almost 40%”.

Last week, as the country was hitting peak “pingdemic”, I met key workers, in places ranging from food plants to care homes, in Manchester. They had been clapped and thanked many times, including by the prime minister. But they told me they still didn’t feel valued – and not just over their pay.
Time and again, ministers have launched schemes from their desks in Westminster that profoundly impact health, safety and lives without ever asking the views of workers and their unions. Dealing with the economic chaos caused by workers in critical sectors being pinged by the NHS app is just the latest example.

Michael Vaughan says a full-strength England team is unlikely

England’s players will seek clarity in the coming days over whether their families will be allowed to join them in Australia for this winter’s Ashes series, amid concerns that some might decide not to participate if it means being separated for several months.
While England’s schedule is always busy – over the last two years they have had 23% more scheduled days of international cricket than India and 54% more than Australia – their forthcoming fixture list is so hectic that a player involved in all of their matches in every format would not get more than a few consecutive days at home between next week and next February.

Given the ebbs and flows of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund’s assessment of the state of the global economy has changed little over the past three months. Back in April the IMF said world growth would be a chunky 6% this year and it has left that forecast unchanged.
Beneath the surface, though, plenty has been going on. The outlook for advanced countries has improved while that for emerging market economies has deteriorated. A new north-south divide is opening up and that’s a big concern.

Calling on rich countries to take urgent action to share at least 1bn doses with developing nations, or risk severe economic consequences, the Washington-based fund said the gap between rich and poor economies had widened during the pandemic and risked worsening further next year.

Bruce Willis is trudging pretty wearily through the motions in this straight-to-digital-oblivion crime thriller, one of those strange films that actually begins with a sort of quasi-trailer, mood-montage of the film’s most exciting bits before the opening credits, featuring characters as yet unexplained. The film squanders one or two promising plot ideas, and winds up making a hamfisted paean of praise to the idea of “open carry” gun ownership.
Willis plays retired Philadelphia cop Jack Harris, who has just lost his wife to cancer, and gone to a remote mountain cabin owned by his niece Pam (Kelly Grayson), to get over his loss. While walking thoughtfully in the surrounding woodland, Jack chances across a terrifying situation: corrupt cop Billie Jean (Lala Kent) is about to execute a hiker, Shannon (Jaime King), because Shannon had witnessed her doing secret drug deals in this secluded forest. Jack pulls his own trusty weapon and just about gets Shannon away; but from there on in, they are having to escape a network of violent, crooked police and their sinister boss, who is running for mayor; this is Hank (Michael Sirow), who has jet black hair and a neatly trimmed beard, like some sort of Vegas magician.

England faces a surge of people being forced to sleep on the streets if the government scraps the scheme introduced to tackle the problem during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report by an influential group of independent experts.
In an intervention timed to put pressure on ministers ahead of the autumn spending review, the Kerslake Commission on Homelessness and Rough Sleeping warned them their only chance of keeping their promise to end rough sleeping by the end of this parliament was to maintain the additional £82m a year in funding.

Since the announcement of the removal of all Covid-related restrictions in England, experts have warned of disastrous consequences, from the inevitable spike in cases to new variants emerging. We can hope the government will eventually recognise the public health risks and put some of these measures back into place. However, power and cronyism – and not health needs – are likely to drive any such decision. As the last 18 months have shown, the British government’s Covid-19 strategy was never designed to manage the virus.
For all the talk of “following the science”, No 10’s use of scientific evidence has been adjusted to its policy preferences throughout. The effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission was acknowledged only in the summer of 2020, despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidance earlier in the year. Ventilation only recently became part of public health guidance in England, despite sustained evidence of aerosol transmission. The UK’s continued insistence on fever, cough, and the loss of smell and taste as symptoms of coronavirus stands in tension with research on asymptomatic infections and emerging evidence suggesting loss of smell and taste may not be as common with the Delta variant.

Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London

Too often, we in the UK have thought of countries such as India and Bangladesh as being on the frontlines of the climate crisis. But the serious flooding in London over the weekend and in the last month – coupled with the extreme weather we’ve seen in other parts of the UK over recent years – shows the realities of climate change are no longer a distant problem, but one that is increasingly reaching our own doorsteps.
Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen homes, businesses and tube stations inundated with floodwater in our city. And while it’s been inspiring to see communities pull together, and local authorities and emergency services reacting quickly to support those in need, the truth is that freak weather events – like the ones we’ve been experiencing here in London and around the world – should be a wake-up call, spurring us all to take much more ambitious climate action.

Surrealism Beyond Borders will come to Tate Modern in February and take a internationalist look at the movement, which began in Europe but would make its way around the world from Tokyo and Mexico City to the Egyptian Art et Liberté movement and the Afro-surrealist work of Aime Cesaire in Martinique.

A new study reveals what some scientists and researchers have suspected for years – that frequent and long-term use of lye-based hair relaxers may have serious health effects, including breast cancer. Published in Oxford University’s Carcinogenesis Journal, the study found that Black women who used these products at least seven times a year for 15 or more years had a roughly 30% increased risk of developing breast cancer compared with more infrequent users.
The research team also analyzed survey data from Boston University’s Black Women’s Health Study, which followed more than 50,000 African American women for more than 25 years and observed their medical diagnoses and any factors that could influence their health. The results? Of the women followed from 1997 to 2017, 95% reported using lye-based relaxers, and ultimately 2,311 developed breast cancers.

Last October, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, laid out the vision behind a new, deeply controversial bill. The government claimed a minority of France’s estimated 6 million Muslims were at risk of forming a “counter-society” and the bill was designed to tackle the dangers of this “Islamist separatism”.
It is meant to safeguard republican values, but critics, including Amnesty International, have raised serious concerns that it may inhibit freedom of association and expression, and increase discrimination. The new law, say critics, will severely affect the construction of mosques, and give more discretion to local authorities to close local associations deemed in conflict with “Republican principles”, a term often wielded against Muslims specifically. But one of the most controversial points is extending the ban on women wearing headscarves in public sector roles, to private organisations that provide a public service. Further amendments were tabled prohibiting full-length swimsuits (“burkinis”), girls under 18 from wearing the hijab in public, and mothers from wearing hijabs on their children’s school trips. These were subsequently overturned, but the stigma they legitimise lives on.

“Sometimes I would be like: where are we? What’s happening? What’s going on? I’m confused. Someone talk to me!” Chiara Aurelia is describing her first major TV role. If it sounds stressful, that’s probably because it was: in Amazon’s new psychological thriller Cruel Summer, the 18-year-old newcomer navigates life – first as a chronically awkward teenager, then as the latest addition to the “popular set” – before being dubbed “the most hated girl in America.”

The woods were full of the sounds of snowmobiles and baying hounds. A group of perhaps a dozen hunters had gathered to give chase to big game along a frozen creek in north-eastern Wisconsin.
Hound hunting, chiefly for black bear and coyote, is a popular pastime in this part of the state. But the houndsman who emerged from the hemlocks onto a snowy road around twilight held a different kind of trophy.

Fiona Brownlee and her grandchildren were among the first to sign up to help protect the rare and endangered trees that populate the grounds of Astley Ainslie, a century-old convalescence hospital in south Edinburgh being eyed up by housing developers.
Harry Brownlee, four, befriended a Lawson cypress; Carys, seven, a Holm oak; Ella, five, a white willow and Ava Strachan, eight, a horse chestnut. Fiona, a retired paediatric occupational therapist who started her training at Astley Ainslie in 1966, grabbed a Spanish chestnut. Her grandchildren, who live locally, play in the landscaped grounds of the hospital.

Whatever role Laura Nyro chose to play – earth mother, soul sister, angel of the Bronx subways – she committed to it. With a soaring, open-hearted voice and ingeniously crafted compositions, Nyro transformed a range of influences into her own kind of art song. She made vertiginous shifts from hushed reveries to ecstatic gospel-driven shout-ups with an intensity and a courage that, as Elton John would point out, left its mark on many contemporaries who achieved greater commercial success.
As the music of the 1960s reached a climax, no one else merged the new songwriting freedoms pioneered by Bob Dylan with the pop sensibility of the Brill Building tunesmiths to such intriguing effect. As a teenager, she wrote And When I Die and Stoney End, songs that became hits for other artists. Her own enigmatically titled albums – Eli and the Thirteenth Confession, New York Tendaberry, Christmas and the Beads of Sweat – showed a precociously sophisticated sensibility.

Every four years, the same argument plays out. The Olympics reminds the public of the existence of rhythmic gymnastics and the public scoffs at this ridiculous spectacle, with its “ribbon dancing”, its sequins, its extravagant bending and pirouetting. Where artistic gymnastics – the one with the beam and the bars, the one with triple backflips and the constant risk of broken bones – is dignified and athletic, rhythmic gymnastics is frilly and absurd. How is this even a sport? Why is it part of the Olympics? These are the usual criticisms. In return, embattled admirers will point out that rhythmic gymnastics is extremely difficult, actually. There is immense skill involved in those backbends and leaps; besides, have you tried throwing and catching a ball while holding your foot above your head?
When I first caught sight of rhythmic gymnastics, I knew nothing of this. The reasons the sport is mocked – the sequins, the balletic dancing, the kilowatt-bright, beauty-pageant smiles of the gymnasts – were the reasons I found it delightful. I was six, sitting in my kitchen in Auckland, staring at the television. On screen, a gymnast at the 2000 Sydney Olympics tossed a bright red ribbon high into the air before catching it with astonishing ease. She was, to me, the height of womanly sophistication: beautiful, graceful, and covered in glitter. I dragged my mother into the room, pointed to the television and announced that this was the sort of lady I would like to become.

A week after “freedom day”, a new pattern has given the UK good news on the coronavirus crisis: new cases fell for six consecutive days, the first time that’s happened without a lockdown in place. But at the same time, hospitalisations and deaths – the result of a previous increase in cases – were still up week on week. And the “pingdemic”, in which 600,000 people were asked by the NHS Covid-19 app to self-isolate in a week, has caused consternation in businesses and hasty exemptions for key workers in an attempt to keep crucial industries afloat.
The Guardian’s science editor, Ian Sample, tells new host Nosheen Iqbal what the trend in case numbers could mean. And he looks at a series of questions raised in this new phase of the pandemic, from the likelihood of hospitalisation among people who have had two vaccinations to the prospect of new variants and the risk of long Covid, asking whether the evidence is yet in place to suggest we have turned a corner.

Time for a baton change. Thanks Tom for a pacesetting lead off leg, and hello everybody from breezy Melbourne, Australia, on what is hopefully the final day of our latest Covid-related lockdown. 
Time to train our focus again on the Tokyo Aquatics Centre where another gold rush awaits. Here’s what’s in store:

Fiji, the defending men’s rugby sevens champions, did not look great in their opening game against Japan but pulped a (usually) strong Great Britain team just now. Ben Harris scored GB’s only try as Fiji won 33-7.

Three Hong Kong judges are expected to deliver a verdict on Tuesday in the first trial of a person charged under the national security law, a landmark case with implications on how the legislation reshapes the city’s common law traditions.
Former waiter Tong Ying-kit, 24, has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism and inciting secession, as well as an alternative charge of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. The acts he is accused of allegedly occurred on 1 July 2020 shortly after the law was enacted.

Nasa in April awarded SpaceX, owned by rival billionaire Elon Musk, a $2.9bn contract to build a spacecraft to bring astronauts to the lunar surface as early as 2024, rejecting bids from Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics. Blue Origin had partnered with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper in the bid.

‘I got puncture and panicked,’ says Taylor-Brown

The most glorious of rainbows formed over Rainbow Bridge here in Tokyo early on Tuesday morning, as the world’s greatest triathletes swam, pedalled and puffed their way around the Odaiba Marine Park. At the end of it, Britain’s Georgia Taylor-Brown could not quite find a pot of Olympic gold. But after suffering a flat tyre on her rear wheel on the bike, the 27-year-old from Manchester discovered the sweetest of silver linings.
As the pre-race favourite Flora Duffy powered clear to become Bermuda’s first Olympic gold medallist in 1hr 55 min 36 sec, Taylor-Brown was on the mother of all retrieval missions. After losing 22 seconds and dropping to fifth because of the puncture, she picked off three of her rivals to take a deserved second, with the American Katie Zaferes claiming bronze.

Thailand’s worsening Covid outbreak is placing intense pressure on hospitals, forcing doctors to treat patients in parking lots and turn away people who are severely ill.
The country was widely praised for its Covid response last year, when it maintained one of the lowest caseloads in the world. However, there is growing public anger over the government’s recent handling of the pandemic, including its slow and chaotic vaccination campaign.

Downing Street and scientists remained cautious about declaring a turning point in the outbreak on Monday night despite a huge drop in Covid case numbers for the sixth day in a row.
No 10 said it was “encouraging” that infections had fallen to their lowest level in three weeks at 24,950 confirmed cases, with Boris Johnson taking the decision to allow more double-vaccinated key workers to avoid isolation with a daily testing programme.

Experts have said medics cannot continue to work at such a high level of intensity, warning that any gains made over recent years in terms of workload and wellbeing risk being reversed.

Ishiguro’s story of an AF, or “artificial friend”, which is bought as a companion for a 14-year-old girl, is one of 13 novels in the running for this year’s Booker, the most prestigious books prize in the UK. The author, who has been shortlisted three times, was praised by judges for his “haunting narrative voice – a genuinely innocent, ego-less perspective on the strange behaviour of humans obsessed and wounded by power, status and fear”.

Here in India, the summer of dying is quickly morphing into what looks very much like a summer of spying.
The second wave of coronavirus has retreated, after leaving an estimated 4 million Indians dead. The official government figure for the number of deaths is a tenth of that – 400,000. In Narendra Modi’s dystopia, even as the smoke dwindled in crematoriums and the earth settled in graveyards, gigantic hoardings appeared on our streets saying “Thank you Modiji”. (An expression of the people’s gratitude-in-advance for the “free vaccine” that remains largely unavailable, and which 95% of the population is yet to receive.) As far as Modi’s government is concerned, any attempt to tabulate the true death toll is a conspiracy against India – as if the millions more who died were simply actors who lay down spitefully in the shallow, mass graves that you saw in aerial photos, or floated themselves into rivers disguised as corpses, or cremated themselves on city sidewalks, motivated solely by the desire to sully India’s international reputation.

NFL Network reported Rodgers says he is close to returning

Green Bay Packers president/CEO Mark Murphy remains hopeful quarterback Aaron Rodgers will play for them this season, but says he doesn’t know whether the three-time MVP will arrive for the start of training camp.
“We’ve been in constant communication,” Murphy said Monday after the NFL’s only publicly owned team held its annual shareholders meeting. “It’s been obviously months. I’m hopeful that we can have it all resolved.”

Governments around the world must agree to end the use of coal power to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown, the UK’s president of vital UN climate talks has said.
Ministers from more than 50 countries closed a two-day meeting in London on Monday without full agreement on phasing out coal, but with all countries agreeing to limit global heating to 1.5C, with fewer than 100 days to go before the Cop26 UN climate conference in Glasgow this November.

“I know what’s happening,” says DI Peter Brown of the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit. “But how do I turn it into evidence?” Slowly, carefully and without taking your eyes off the prize seems to be the answer, given over three episodes of the documentary Taken: Hunting the Sex Traffickers (Channel 4). It follows a three-year investigation, prompted by an anonymous letter to a police station in Gloucester, into a man called Mark Viner. He is suspected of being part of one of the estimated 4,500 organised crime gangs (yes, they do use the shorthand OCG, just like in Line of Duty) involved in money laundering, running brothels and trafficking the women working there.
The unit puts Viner under surveillance and painstakingly pieces the jigsaw together: the trips to Brazil and the return journeys with young female companions; the lavish lifestyle that could not possibly be funded by the pension that is his only recorded source of income; the discovery of three flats owned by Viner, out of which the women work; and the arrest of an accomplice, Lezlie Davies. Davies cries at the revelation that his friend Mark is involved in the exploitation of women, but his phone and other belongings provide a riposte to his claims of innocence, plus a wealth of new leads for the police in pursuit of Viner. The movement of cash is tracked. Women who have been bought and sold “like meat”, as one puts it, are interviewed. Other accomplices are found.

Vunipola was initially omitted from the 23-man squad for the 22-17 triumph but was called on to the bench last Friday following a shoulder injury to Wyn Jones. Rory Sutherland was promoted to the starting XV but struggled on his Lions Test debut whereas Vunipola added ballast to the scrum after coming on in the 56th minute.

Nine years ago, I had a front-row seat at the Olympic Stadium in London for what would become known as Super Saturday. The ley lines of that evening are now firmly etched into the sporting lore of the UK: the triumphant last-lap surge of Jess Ennis, Mo Farah being physically roared over the line, that chirpy bloke who won the long jump. And yet my strongest and clearest memory of Super Saturday is none of these things.
It came about half an hour after Farah crossed the line, with the stadium still wreathed in a shimmering glow somewhere between heat and love. At which point, a member of the crowd shouted out to nobody in particular that 150 miles away in Cardiff, Team GB had just lost to South Korea on penalties in the quarter-finals of the men’s football. As the news filtered around, everybody – from the crowd to the press box to the journalist from L’Equipe sitting next to me – spontaneously burst into laughter.

One of the pleasures of post-lockdown life has been the chance to go back to familiar businesses and high street shops, putting some much-needed cash into tills. Though often hit by the long-term shift to online retail – which the pandemic, of course, accelerated – such places continue to knit the social fabric together in vital ways. But despite all the local goodwill and the revival of trade, for some much-loved ports of call it may be a case of too little, too late. According to a review published this month, Britain’s high streets are threatened by a “tsunami of closures”, thanks to the debt taken on by small business owners during the past year-and-a-half.
The report concludes that “urgent support is required” if a trail of destruction is not to unfold, when loans are called in and tax breaks end. Unfortunately, the government is about to make matters worse, not better. Next week, Whitehall plans to unleash a developers’ free-for-all that threatens to irrevocably change the character and texture of town centres and high streets across the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2011 a repressive, authoritarian government collapsed because it proved unable to meet people’s demands. Why would its return solve anything?
In 2011 Tunisia was the first Arab nation to topple its dictator, and the only one where genuine democracy survives. But events in the capital, Tunis, suggest that the country is experiencing a counter-revolution. On Sunday the president, Kais Saied, fired the country’s prime minister, dismissed the government and froze parliament. Mr Saied has suspended lawmakers’ parliamentary immunity, a pointed warning to political opponents. It is never a good sign when security forces storm television stations. Demonstrations have broken out – with protesters taking to the streets both in support for the president, and against him. The warmth of the Arab spring has definitely turned into the chill of winter.
The opposition – led principally by Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party with the most seats in parliament – called his actions “a coup”. It’s hard to disagree with that description. But many in Tunisia either shrug their shoulders or, even worse, are drawn to demagogues, religious hardliners and those who praise the country’s former dictatorship. The reason that sections of the population are receptive to either apathy or illiberal notions is that freedom and democracy in Tunisia have not delivered political stability and a prosperous economy.

The UK government has signalled that it is monitoring the sale of a key military supplier to a firm backed by US private equity amid concerns over the potential impact on national security. 
The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to have instructed Whitehall officials to keep close tabs on the multibillion-pound takeover bid of Ultra Electronics lodged by Cobham, which is owned by the American private equity group Advent.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Mothballed planes and deserted terminals tell their own story. Aviation has been one of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic and looks like being one of the last to recover. Unless things pick up in the next six months Heathrow will see fewer passengers this year than it did in 2020.
It doesn’t come as much of a shock, therefore, to find the chief executive of the airport wondering why recovery has been so slow. And although John Holland-Kaye was talking about his own business, he might as well have been talking about the whole economy when he asked: where is the vaccine dividend?

My maternal grandmother was a head nurse in a hospital in the northern state of Chihuahua during the Mexican Revolution – an epic event that affected both sides of the border and caused my family to permanently move to the United States to escape the violence.
Grandmother worked at the hospital, family lore goes, when the infamous general Pancho Villa seized the facility and left his wounded troops to the hospital’s care. Mama, as we called her, took it upon herself to watch out for the female nurses amid all the soldiers, some of whom made unwanted sexual advances to them. She reported them to Villa’s officers. That’s when Villa showed up and asked Mama to point out the offending soldiers. When she did, he drew his pistol and summarily executed the men, astonishing the witnesses and delivering the message to his army that this behavior would not be tolerated.

Two teardrops stood still for a moment and glistened on Tom Daley’s skin soon after he and Matty Lee had draped gold medals around each other’s necks. Earlier on Monday afternoon they had won the synchronised 10-metre platform amid great drama and emotion in Tokyo. A single teardrop slipped from Daley’s left eye. It stopped millimetres from the black Team GB mask covering his face. A little higher up, another solitary teardrop nestled just below the lower lid of his right eye. It was as if even his tears had paused to remember everything Daley had been through to reach this pinnacle of achievement.

The theological definition of a just war is, in part, that it has to be winnable. It’s interesting to consider generational warfare in that light: what would it look like if one side won? Would young people all simply be required to pipe down? Would it be enough if all old people downsized at once? Luckily, the clash between young and old is a political and media confection rather than a Thing.
It’s political in the sense that, every now and again, an idea will come along that so clearly puts the interests of one demographic over another that it simply sticks in the throat, and even middle-aged people can’t swallow it – paying for social care by raising national insurance, for instance. It doesn’t even warrant any detailed examination of the taxation system and social care crisis; a simple “absolutely no way” will do.

Fans missing live Tokyo Olympics coverage of their favourite sports are being urged to be patient as the BBC juggles live streams in its most challenging Games, due to Covid and reduced broadcasting rights.
The corporation’s head of major sport events, Ron Chakraborty, acknowledged viewer frustration that the BBC could only offer two live events at one time – through one television channel and on iPlayer red button – after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) sold European television rights to the pay-TV company Discovery in 2015.

When the Scottish author Isla Dewar, who has died aged 74 after a heart attack, completed her first novel, Keeping Up With Magda, she rather doubted that the stories she had started transferring from her head to paper would go much further. Nonetheless, within a fortnight a publisher took up her tale of intrigue centred on a cafe in a Scottish fishing village, and after its publication in 1995 it was longlisted for the Orange prize. 
Her next book, Women Talking Dirty (1996), caught the attention of Elton John and David Furnish, who bought the rights for Rocket Pictures. Two years after it was published Dewar was transported from enjoyable semi-isolation in her seaside home on the East Neuk of Fife to the couple’s mansion in Windsor to write the screenplay. Taking William Goldman’s Adventures in the Screen Trade as a guide, she launched into 16-hour days of writing and script meetings, and used the pool to unwind.

Protesters had demanded the selection of a figure removed from the political elite, but the Lebanese parliament instead named a billionaire tycoon, Najib Miqati, who had led the country twice before, with little success, and was accused by a state prosecutor in 2019 of embezzlement – a charge he denies and has described as politically motivated.

Plus letters from Phil de Souza and David Dear
As someone who played a small part in promoting Liverpool’s case for world heritage status in the early 2000s, I was saddened to see the loss of the Unesco designation (Unesco strips Liverpool of its world heritage status). It is, nevertheless, a timely reminder of the responsibilities of local and central government to guard and conserve both the built heritage that merits this highest of distinctions and, equally importantly, its distinctive setting.
The pictures you published illustrate the failure to do so in Liverpool’s Victorian docks. The right sort of regeneration is not in conflict with heritage – quite the opposite. Unfortunately, Liverpool’s planning committee permitted a number of out-of-scale developments unsympathetic to the character of the docks. They were surely warned of the potential consequences. A fresh visit to the city by Unesco would simply confirm the decline in the unique character of the docks in the last 10 years.

Equal parts folk, prog rock and metal, The Green Knight takes place at the inflection point when one version of the old world was supplanted by the next. In David Lowery’s liberty-taking interpretation of the character’s 14th-century origin poem, the headstrong yet not-quite-valiant Sir Gawain (Dev Patel, superb) traverses an England caught between the mystical pagan religions and the nascent Christianity soon to change the face of the nation.
At first, subtler touches denote the friction between the two, as in the cross-cutting juxtaposition of a supernatural blood-and-bone ritual against the quasi-biblical imagery of an ageing Arthur’s court. (The king’s crown doesn’t take the shape of a golden disc framing his head for nothing.) By the time near the third act that Lowery reveals his key reference point to be Martin Scorsese’s Last Temptation of Christ, another mounting of myth invested in mortal frailty and unconcerned with textual fidelity, it’s apparent that the maturation of one man is meant to coincide with that of an entire society.

Of course, the pressure of a British & Irish Lions series is intense. Of course, emotions will overflow occasionally. Rarely, though, has a World Cup-winning coach been at greater risk of tossing away so much global goodwill in a few days than South Africa’s director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus. You do not have to be an expert on the subject of Twitter accounts to wonder if conquering the world in 2019 has maybe gone to somebody’s head.

Something strange is happening within the political party famously ruthless in its pursuit of power and keeping hold of it. Its still popular prime minister, with an 80-seat majority, has only just marked his second anniversary, and has faced little threat from the official opposition so far. And yet Boris Johnson goes into the parliamentary recess up against a crescendo of howls from his own side. The rift opening up in the Conservative party is startling in its ferocity, and has revealed a new animosity towards its leader.
“Senior ministers”, “over half the cabinet”, “high-ranking MPs” are variously reported to be in rebellion against all the government’s key policies. Raising the national insurance rate to pay for NHS and social care has triggered profound existential angst about how to be a Tory after the Covid crisis. An erstwhile loyal press claque has turned angry and accusatory. What kind of Conservative is Johnson, anyway?

Flash flooding of the type seen in London this weekend will become a more common occurrence as the climate crisis worsens, scientists have warned, and the UK government, businesses and householders must do much more to protect against future harm.
Dr Jess Neumann, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said: “Flooding from intense summer rainfall is going happen more frequently. No city, town or village is immune to flooding and we all need to take hard action right now if we are to prevent impacts from getting worse in the future.”

On 7 September 2020, Scott Walker posted a plea on Facebook for his daughter, 17-year-old Bernadette, to come home. She had been missing since 18 July, he said, after jumping out of his car and running away when he pulled over during a drive home. “We are both worried. We miss u. We need to know that you’re safe,” he said on behalf of himself and Sarah Walker, Bernadette’s mother. 
More than a year after her disappearance, Scott Walker has been found guilty of Bernadette’s murder, while Sarah Walker, his ex-partner, has been found guilty by majority verdicts of two counts of perverting the course of justice “knowing or believing” Bernadette to be dead. Bernadette has never been found.

The shocking temperature extremes suffered in the Pacific north-west and in Australia 2019-2020 were “exactly what we are talking about”, said the scientists. But they said the world had yet to see anything close to the worst impacts possible, even under the global heating that had already happened.

Foes can be cast into the past or future in a whimsical time-bending throwback that celebrates Colombia
This week marked both Colombian Independence Day and the release of Cris Tales, an enchanting homage to classic Japanese RPGs and Colombia itself from a homegrown development team. It’s a whimsical fantasy journey with magical realist roots that ground it firmly in the now, even as it transports the player between the past and future.
The combat twist we’ve seen before is timed button presses while attacking and defending, which make the turn-based fights feel more involved. The twist we haven’t seen before is heroine Crisbell’s time manipulation. Foes on the left of the screen can be sent into the past, and those on the right into the future. You’ll age and de-age goblins, soak then rust armour, blossom explosive plants, and reverse your companions’ deaths.

Boris Johnson could rethink plans for a national insurance rise to fund an overhaul of social care, after a significant backlash from cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs.
At least five cabinet ministers are said to oppose plans for a 1% increase in national insurance, likely to be branded a health and social care levy, to tackle the NHS Covid backlog and long-term funding for a more generous social care package based on a cost cap.

While the government’s decision to remove most lockdown measures in England was widely expected to result in a large wave of infection and disease, the number of new cases of Covid-19 has been falling over the last five days. Many hope this could mean that we’re past the peak. Yet the reality is more complicated. This is the first time an epidemic has taken place in a highly vaccinated population without control measures in place, so we are in uncharted territory. There is considerable uncertainty about what the next two months hold.
The big questions are how high the current wave will get and how long it will last. The number of people in hospital and dying of Covid-19 is directly linked to the number of infections. It’s impossible to accurately predict when we’ll reach the peak of infections, or how long it will take to come back down from this (if I had a pound for every time I’m asked “are we there yet?”, I’d be able to give away a lot of money).

Close supervision centres (CSCs) hold some of the most dangerous men in the prison system in small, highly supervised units within high-security jails in conditions previously described by the prisons inspector as “the most restrictive … with limited stimuli and human contact”.

52 held in close supervision prison units ‘that may amount to torture’


Kevan Thakrar was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 35 years in jail in 2008 for the murder of three men in a dispute over drugs, and the attempted murder of two women who were in the house at the time. His brother, Miran, fired the shots but Kevan was convicted under the law of joint enterprise. After being accused of attacking prison guards at HMP Farkland, he was reportedly moved to a close supervision centre (CSC) in March 2010. The following year he was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder and three counts of wounding with intent in relation to the attack on prison guards, whom he admitted injuring but claimed he did so because he feared being attacked himself. Despite the acquittal he is believed to have remained in CSCs at different locations ever since.
Nils Melzer, the UN special rapporteur for torture, said of Kevan Thakrar: “For the past 11 years, he is being held alone in a cell for more than 22 hours a day, is not permitted to participate in regular prison activities, receives his food through a hatch and does not even have a privacy screen when using the toilet inside his cell.”

The lineup for the 2021 event in September was announced on Monday by artistic director Alberto Barbera, which, like last year’s edition at the height of the pandemic, will be a primarily in-person event. It will closely follow Cannes, which staged a physical festival earlier this month, having been forced to delay from its traditional slot in mid-May.

We grew up without a TV. Our house faced a railway line and my brother Chris made friends with a boy called Jim Brownlow through a shared love of trainspotting. One day, Jim brought this unspeakably foul record around: Derek and Clive. It was full of swearing. The idea that you could sell such vulgarity was stunning.
Jim also introduced us to adult comics like Fat Freddy’s Cat and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, which inspired Chris to start drawing little cartoons, such as an inept superhero called The Fat Crusader on our dad’s spare invoice pads, to pass around at school. Jim and Chris then created The Daily Pie, which was lots of little comic strips on one page of A4, and Arnold the Magazine, which we sold for 2p – the price of a photocopy – at pubs and youth clubs to amuse our friends.

Call it the lockdown paradox: after spending so much time in isolation, adjusting to smaller lives, we may now be struggling to expand them.
Now that restrictions have been lifted, the pressure to pack our calendars, make the most of the summer and say yes to every invitation is coming up uncomfortably against a public that is not match-fit for marathon socialising. Even those butterflies who used to happily flit from event to event may now be finding one is enough.

The first full-capacity festival since the pandemic began hosted a series of artists – Sons of Kemet and Self Esteem among them – that show how vibrant the UK’s scene still is

Standing in a field, wearing glitter, watching bands, with a warm pint in blazing hot sun: these human behaviours had to be relearned for the first full-capacity UK music festival since the pandemic began. Some 40,000 unmasked people are taking part in Latitude’s trial as part of the government’s events research programme – results are as yet unclear but its success or failure could inform the staging of other festivals this summer.
A lateral flow test before entry and a daily health screening are the only obstacles to normality. It’s overwhelming – risky, even. But it all quickly comes rushing back: the giddy thrill of dancing next to strangers in a tent, queues for halloumi, the stamina it takes to pace across the site to see as many acts as possible. The only real difference is that men are washing their hands after a trip to the toilets.

However, on Monday he joined the gold rush, winning Great Britain’s third gold medal with a dominant ride in the men’s cross-country mountain bike race in Izu.

Formerly known as Swaziland, the country has been rocked in recent weeks by anti-monarchy protests calling for King Mswati III, Africa's last absolute monarch, to have his powers diluted. 
Protests turned violent, with reports suggesting there have been more than 50 deaths and countless casualties so far at the hands of state security forces. The Guardian spoke to Mbuyisa, who described his experience of being beaten by the police after they accused him of reporting illegally, and explained why protesters are calling for more democracy in Eswatini.
In his first comments since the unrest began, the king called the protests 'satanic' and said they had taken the country backwards.

The beautifully defined shapes look so great on a plate and it’s easy to mess them up a bit, taking them away from the prescribed neatness of 80s nouvelle cuisine. Mexico is awash with delectable variations of stuffed chillies, and these peppers are inspired by dishes I’ve had over there.

Branco has detected something underground and, when the mine-clearing team is brought in to investigate, they find an improvised explosive device (IED), known locally as a VS500.

“We have to make the most of this. This is a deprived community in this part of Birmingham, so getting on for three-quarters of a billion pounds of investments into this area should make it the envy of towns and cities up and down the country,” said Ian Ward as he launched a consultation on a masterplan for the area, which he hopes will guide its development over the next 20 years and determine the legacy of the Games.

The turn of the millennium is not generally considered a vintage era for mainstream music in the UK. Sandwiched between Britpop and the mid-00s indie revival, it was a period dominated by talent show winners, girl- and boybands, ex-boyband and girlband members, acts with tie-ins to kids’ TV shows, and doleful singer-songwriters such as Dido and David Gray. It was sometimes trite, occasionally rapturous and – Dido and Gray aside – frivolous, family-friendly fun.
It isn’t, in other words, an era you’d expect a pop star on the cultural vanguard to be into. Yet last month Lorde revealed that her forthcoming third album was influenced by what she calls “early 00s bubblegum pop” – in particular, tween-targeted hitmakers S Club 7, Natasha Bedingfield, Natalie Imbruglia, All Saints and Nelly Furtado. She is not alone – the reclamation of late 90s and early 00s mainstream pop by young artists is now fully under way. Many heard shades of S Club in Dua Lipa’s 2020 album Future Nostalgia, and Lipa’s single Don’t Start Now had more than a bit of Spiller and Sophie Ellis Bextor’s 2000 smash Groovejet in its DNA.

As a teenager growing up in Manchester, Priscilla was a big fan of CB radio. The system, which was designed for truck drivers to communicate, became a craze at her school in the 90s. “I convinced my mum to buy one,” she remembers. “It had 40 channels and there was one where you could shout out to speak to other people and move to another channel for a chat.” As with modern social media accounts, users chose a handle for themselves.
In 1996, she started talking to Anthony and they bonded over their shared love of happy hardcore music. “My handle was Ecstasy and his was Haçienda,” she laughs. Around the same time, Anthony became friends with a boy who lived close to Priscilla. “I saw her one day when I was with him and he told me that was Cilla AKA Ecstasy from the radio,” he says. “I’d not seen her before, so didn’t know what she looked like. I liked her straight away. She was beautiful.”

Almost four decades ago, Margaret Thatcher’s government boldly predicted that privatising Britain’s bus sector would lead to “lower fares, new services, and more passengers”, while removing “any potential future liability on the taxpayer”.
Today, those claims seem farcical, with much of the bus sector in crisis. Private operators have profited handsomely, but passengers dependent on buses to get to work, access services and visit loved ones have suffered greatly. Taxpayers are subsidising corporate profits, while companies run a service so confusing and ineffective that riders have abandoned it in droves, undermining efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions.

How did you sleep last night? Insomnia rates have soared during successive lockdowns: anyone would think facing a constant existential threat isn’t the ideal preparation for a refreshing eight hours. Suggested remedies abound – behavioural, pharmaceutical, nonsensical and bleeding obvious – and I have tried most of them.
Insomnia can be a competitive sport and I am not podium material; I’m a common or garden poor sleeper, rarely getting more than five hours a night (luxury, I hear the real insomniacs hissing in red-eyed fury), often less and sometimes, thankfully rarely, none. That is not exceptional. It’s not the stuff of insomnia memoirs, which do exist, but I refuse to read any in case they give my brain and body ideas. But it is wearing. On nights when sleep just isn’t happening, I’m filled with despair at the realisation that I will not get even a short break from being in my own head.

AK Benjamin is the pseudonym of a clinical neuropsychologist 

As a clinical neuropsychologist I make mistakes, and I am not alone. Researchers interested in clinical decision-making estimate that across all medical fields diagnosis is wrong 10–15% of the time.
In many instances clinical errors are underpinned by one of a number of cognitive biases. For example, the “availability bias” favours more recent, readily available answers, irrespective of their accuracy; the “confirmation bias” fits information to a preconceived diagnosis rather than the converse. In the time-restricted milieu of emergency medicine, where I work on occasion, particular biases compound: “the commission bias”, a proclivity for action over inaction, increases the likelihood of “search satisfying” – ceasing to look for further information when the first plausible solution is found, which itself might be propelled by “diagnostic momentum” where clinicians blindly continue existing courses of action instigated by (more “powerful”) others.

For climate campaigners, 26 May seemed like the start of a long-awaited reckoning for oil and gas companies.
Over a single 24-hour period, a Dutch court ordered Shell to dramatically cut emissions, shareholders voted to force Chevron to reduce emissions from the products it sells, and a tiny activist investment firm secured three positions on ExxonMobil’s 12-member board for candidates committed to climate action.

In this time, he has been a staple of the New York scene, the studio partner of Amy Winehouse and a superproducer of artists from Ghostface Killah to Lady Gaga. He has his own instantly recognisable, vintage-leaning sound and is the invisible touch on songs that define not just years but decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The MSC’s coveted blue tick is the world’s biggest, and some say best, fishery ecolabel. So why is it in the headlines – and does it really do what it says on the tin?
This month, two right whales in the Gulf of St Lawrence were found entangled in fishing gear. One, a female, was first spotted entangled off Cape Cod last year, but rescuers were not able to fully free her; the other, a male, is believed to have become entangled in the Gulf.
Hunted to near extinction before a partial whaling ban in 1935, North Atlantic right whales are once more critically endangered, with only 356 left. The main threat remains human contact: entanglement in fishing gear, and ship strikes. Fatal encounters, caused in part by the whales’ migratory shift into Canada’s snow crab grounds, have soared: more than a tenth of the population died or were seriously injured between 2017 and 2021, mostly in Canada and New England.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When journalist Mary Ann Sieghart set out to document the ways that women are held back by a cultural presumption of their inferiority, she found reams of data to support her case – and heard stories of how it affects even the most successful women in the world. She explains why the authority gap persists, and asks what we can do about it
From the very beginning of her career as a journalist in the 1980s, Mary Ann Sieghart found herself pushing against a set of assumptions which accorded her less authority than her male peers – and and led to her being viewed as bigheaded if she showed the same ambition and confidence as they did. When she came to write a book about how experiences such as hers still shape women’s lives, she found a huge range of empirical evidence that confirmed the existence of those prejudices. And when she asked some of the most accomplished women in the world – from Bernardine Evaristo to Hillary Clinton – she learned that they had all experienced the same “authority gap”, no matter how remarkable their CVs.
Sieghart speaks to Rachel Humphreys about why the authority gap remains a pervasive phenomenon, and what tactics women can use to try to circumvent it. We also hear excerpts from some of Sieghart’s interviews, featuring examples of the problem perpetrated by everyone from literary prize judges to restaurant staff to ... the pope.

For a few tantalising minutes it appeared that gold could be in the 23-year-old’s grasp, but he had no answer to a stunning final lap surge from the Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt.
An enthralling race appeared to be in the balance after the 1500m swim, 40km bike and three-quarters of the 10km run. But it was then that Blummenfelt, a burly 27-year-old from Bergen, kicked hard and established a lead he never relinquished.

Buoyed by the vaccine rollout and a bounce back in consumer spending, the EY Item Club said it now expected GDP to grow by 7.6% – which would be the fastest annual growth in national income since 1941. The UK economy shrank by 9.8% in 2020, the worst performance in the G7.

• ‘We think there is another level in us’
Warren Gatland has cranked up the pressure on the “incredibly desperate” Springboks and claimed the British & Irish Lions have another gear to find as they seek to clinch series victory in South Africa next Saturday.
The Lions struck first blood last Saturday by overturning a nine-point deficit at half-time to seal a 22-17 victory in Cape Town, with Gatland highlighting their defensive dominance in the second half as key. The Springboks have refused to blame their disrupted preparations for flagging after the interval but Gatland has questioned whether South Africa will be able to change things around in the space of just seven days, while predicting further improvements from his side.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Increasing numbers of young people with coronavirus are being admitted to hospital – including to intensive care wards – doctors have said, begging them not to “suffer unnecessarily” and to get the vaccine.
During the first weekend after the majority of Covid restrictions were lifted in England there were pictures of crowded nightclubs, filled with revellers not wearing masks or social distancing. Medics raised the alarm that unvaccinated young people urgently needed to protect themselves against infection to avoid serious illness.

‘Of course, I spoke with Arsène on the phone,” Patrick Vieira recalled in an interview with L’Équipe in April. “And one of the first things that he said to me was: ‘You are not a real manager until you get sacked.’”
On 14 August, it will be 25 years to the day since the France midfielder born in Senegal – one of the Premier League’s greatest players – signed for Arsenal. By quirk of fate, that date happens to be when Vieira will follow in the footsteps of his mentor, Arsène Wenger, and take charge of his first league match in English football as a manager. A day after Arsenal kick off their campaign at promoted Brentford, Vieira will be in the dugout at Stamford Bridge to face old rivals and European champions Chelsea in quite the baptism of fire.

The number of patients being admitted to hospital with severe liver injuries caused by herbal and dietary supplements claiming to promote muscle growth or weight loss is increasing, with some people harmed so severely they required a liver transplant.
A study led by Dr Emily Nash from the Royal Prince Alfred hospital examined hospital records of 184 adults admitted to the AW Morrow Gastroenterology and Liver Centre with drug-induced liver injury between 2009 and 2020. She and her co-authors found liver injury cases linked to herbal and dietary supplements increased from two out of 11 patients (15%) during 2009–11, to 10 out of 19 patients (47%) during 2018–20.

On Friday, Haiti buried its assassinated president, Jovenel Moïse, at a funeral itself marred by unrest, with shots fired outside. The truth about his killing may have gone to the grave with him. Much remains uncertain, and a senior government minister has suggested that the “big fishes” behind it are still at large.
But the more important question is what the future holds for a desperately poor, unequal and troubled country. The murder is the latest iteration of a long-running political crisis, in which Haitian elites and foreign powers call the shots while ordinary people suffer. It is a bitter paradox that the people of the world’s first black republic, born of a successful slave revolt, have rarely had a chance to seize their destiny since.

Earlier this month, a 12-metre-long model train carriage was deposited at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, which the Spanish airports authority controversially plans to expand. “More trains, less planes” was the accompanying message from Greenpeace activists, who intend to take their model on a European tour in the coming months.
As they do so, a celebratory stop-off at the French-Spanish border might be in order. In a village high in the Pyrenees, Europe’s most stunning railway station is to be restored to its former glory, and the line it majestically served reopened. Completed in 1928, Canfranc international station was conceived as a railway “cathedral” as grand as anything that the world’s greatest cities could offer. Overlooked by mountains, the vast edifice is 240 metres in length and has 365 windows and 156 doors, dwarfing London’s St Pancras; but mere numbers cannot convey the sense of grandeur evoked by its architecture and ravishing setting. Intended to combine in one building the French and Spanish border stations, Canfranc is a moving monument to the internationalist spirit and pride in architectural achievement that marked the golden age of rail.

The trio also comfortably secured a place in Tuesday’s team final, going through as second-best qualifiers, and they appear on course for a third successive Olympic medal after gold in London and silver five years ago.

Alice Capsey had plenty of time to contemplate her opening gambit here.

Then, facing her very first delivery, she danced down the pitch and clouted Naomi Dattani straight over midwicket for four. In her first innings at Lord’s. At the age of 16. You know, as you do.
In turning the sport’s most famous strip of turf into her own personal playpen, Capsey announced herself as one of the brightest new faces in the women’s game. The youngest player in the Hundred, Capsey is so young that her coach Jonathan Batty had to ring her mother to ask permission to call her up. She will receive her GCSE results in the middle of the tournament. In another sense, however, this was her graduation day.

People from Caribbean countries such as Jamaica appear to be disproportionately targeted for deportation from the UK if they commit crimes, according to Home Office data obtained by the Guardian following a yearlong freedom of information battle.
One pressure group said the high percentage of Jamaican nationals deported was particularly glaring given their greater likelihood of having family ties in the UK, and warned that it could further erode the trust of people affected by the Windrush scandal.

Your article (England may have to reimpose Covid rules in August, scientists warn, 21 July) says some restrictions may have to be reintroduced within three weeks to avoid the NHS becoming overwhelmed – but it already is. I’m a paramedic at a 999 call centre and I have never known things to be so bad.
People are waiting in excess of 15 minutes to have their calls answered. Can you imagine waiting so long for an operator to ask “Is the patient breathing” if they’re not?

With respect to your article, NHS England’s plan to implement five new waiting time standards is mere virtue signalling and will not lead to improvements in mental health care unless backed by increased funding.
As the Guardian has reported, mental health beds are down 25% since 2010, and this is mirrored by similar cuts elsewhere in mental health services. In a system already nearing breaking point, does NHS England really believe that our inability to see patients in good time is down to a lack of targets, rather than resource and staffing shortages?

In the depths of winter, at the pandemic’s height, an idea of this summer took hold. It would, we told ourselves, be the summer of outdoors, particularly for children, who had been shut inside on screens for too long. Travelling abroad might be out, but that was fine. If the past year had taught us anything, it was the value of small pleasures, closer to home. On freezing March days, I warmed myself with an image of July and August in Central Park. I would read and commune with nature while camp counsellors forced my kids to spend eight hours a day playing rounders.
As it turns out, this isn’t really happening. We’re almost halfway through the absurdly long school holidays – New York state schools let out in June and don’t go back until 13 September, a closure of almost 11 weeks – and for the first time, our summer schedule is being influenced less by cost, work or babysitting, than by something to which I’ve never given serious consideration: weather.

2019 world champion almost emulates achievement

With eight seconds of his Olympics remaining, at close to 10pm Tokyo time, Bradly Sinden was two points ahead of Ulugbev Rashitov and on course to become Team GB’s first gold medal of Tokyo 2020. Not to mention, aged 22, the first British man ever to win a taekwondo gold. Sinden is from Doncaster, the son of a single mother whose sacrifices – from the time and expense of all that junior travel to constant parental encouragement – he would speak about later, as a major part to his success.
Sinden has also spoken about making his own mark, growing the sport, becoming an icon and a role model. Like most Olympians, flowers that bloom in the dark and then appear suddenly in the nation’s eyeline every four years, those networks, plus his own talent and will, had led him to this point, eight seconds from a kind ultimacy.

Shifting picture of women’s gymnastics landscape emerges

As Simone Biles walked off the podium following her opening floor routine of her Tokyo Olympics, she laughed bitterly to herself. She had overpowered her third tumbling pass so much that she ended up rebounding the floor and flying so far out of bounds that she cleared the raised floor. She was not happy. But what initially seemed to be an aberration in her first rotation of USA’s qualifying round turned out to be a reflection of the whole day.
With every passing rotation, the errors for USA piled up, culminating in an event that has not occurred over their past decade of dominance – for the first time since 2010, USA qualified in second for a major team final after scoring 170.562 as Russian Olympic Committee finished the day in the lead with 171.629.

There is possibly only one thing worse for social justice movements than getting no recognition, and that is getting too much. Over the past few years, the subversive energy of popular movements for equality, whether #MeToo or Black Lives Matter, has regularly been appropriated by corporations.
Big businesses tend to have a good nose for trends that could affect their bottom lines, and so move early to show support for whatever fashionable cause has broken through. There is little actual activism going on here. These solidarity shout-outs are a safe, low-cost way both to get ahead of any internal issues that might end up being exposed, and to win over the sorts of customers who make political change part of their consumer habits. But the appearance of change, rather than any seismic shift, is what these corporates seem to prefer. The year since the Black Lives Matter protests has exposed the gap between internal practices and pledges of support for racial equality in many companies, with employees coming out to protest against what they see as tokenistic gestures.

During the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics, the BBC was able to offer dozens of free livestreams of different sports, revolutionising the way British viewers watched the games and providing much needed publicity to niche events that would not normally have enjoyed their moment in the public eye.

In a phone call, Macron expressed concern that his phone and those of most of his cabinet could have been infected with Pegasus, hacking software developed by the Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group, which enables operators of the tool to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones from infected devices.

If Jackie Mason could speak to us now, he’d surely be reporting back on the amusing ways in which Jews do the afterlife. But if we’ll never get to hear that particular hot take (“If it’s in the news,” he used to say, “it’s in the show”), in his long career in comedy Mason made sure to cover his people’s every other trait and proclivity. If anyone ever doubted that Jewish America had created standup comedy as we now know it, Mason – born Yacov Moshe Maza – stood as living proof.
That’s part of what made his shows compelling long after his opinions curdled and his comedy fell from fashion. The theatres he played in were like Tardises spinning us back to the so-called Borscht Belt of the Catskill mountains in the 1950s, where Jewish America spent its summers laughing at Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Jack Benny – and Mason himself, who worked as a busboy and a lifeguard there before turning his hand to jokes. He was good at them, so he quit working as a rabbi – a career path followed by his three brothers and all their male forebears – and the rest was comedy history.

For decades, the Scout movement has been promoted as offering the chance to experience adventures and gain life skills but a review of offenders shows that for scores of children it has led to abuse at the hands of someone entrusted with their welfare.

Inspired by formal portrait photography of black Victorian Britons, Jeanefer Jean-Charles’s sensual dance work restores life and humanity to its forgotten subjects
The frame – both scenographic and historical – for Jeanefer Jean-Charles’s Black Victorians is photography. Its point of departure was a 2014 exhibition of rediscovered photographs of black people in 19th-century Britain: stiffly posed studio portraits whose subjects are frequently wearing the tailcoats, collars, bonnets and crinolines familiar from countless British costume dramas.

Kiesenhofer was only member of breakaway not reeled in

Anna Kiesenhofer caused one of the biggest upsets in Olympic road racing history on Sunday, taking advantage of a tactical mistake by experienced riders to win the women’s road race title in bizarre circumstances.
The Austrian was involved in the lead group right from the start of the 137km race, before embarking on a sustained period of disciplined solo cycling so brilliantly executed that her pursuers simply forgot she was ahead of them.

The government could face “limitless” losses as a result of businesses that accept payments in untaxed and untraceable cryptocurrencies going bust, an insolvency expert has warned.
A growing number of companies, including the ethical cosmetics firm Lush and office-sharing firm WeWork, have begun taking payments for goods and services in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, alongside debit payments, credit or cash.

There was a little bit of Olympic history made at Tsurigasaki beach early on Sunday morning when four surfers paddled out into the Pacific for the start of the Games’ very first surfing competition. No one was exactly sure who caught the first wave, maybe the Brazilian, Italo Ferreira.
“It was a terrible start,” he said with a laugh, “I made two turns and fell”. He won the heat anyway, so didn’t mind. Nor did anyone watching. From where we were sitting back on the glistening golden-brown sand, looking out at the blue-green sea and pale sky, the pressing question about Olympic surfing was why the International Olympic Committee took so long coming around to it.

Amid uninspiring opinion polling and after a very close shave in Batley and Spen – which prompted an outpouring of triumphalism way out of proportion with Labour’s narrow win there – Keir Starmer has taken the opportunity to settle some scores. After a marathon nine-hour meeting of Labour’s ruling national executive committee on Tuesday, it was announced, as expected, that four leftwing groups had been proscribed: Socialist Appeal, Labour Against the Witchhunt, Labour in Exile Network and Resist.
Reports suggest that the move could see up to 1,000 Labour members effectively expelled from the party. It isn’t necessary to carry a torch for all or any of these groups to see the cynicism of the manoeuvre. For some, the decision to proscribe these groups has rekindled memories of Neil Kinnock’s war on the Labour left in the 1980s; indeed, Socialist Appeal is the fragment of Militant that remained in Labour after the rest of the organisation was driven out three decades ago. As for the others, it is unclear how many of their members are still in Labour. Membership is down by about 120,000 from its peak under Jeremy Corbyn.

Cats are perfect to most people, but not to my 42-year-old mother. She is just like any of my 17-year-old friends’ parents – she is spirited, sparky, generous and can be feisty when she needs to be. She cooks arguably the best chicken parmesan in the world, and also has impeccable taste in Bollywood music. But there is one annoying trait that makes her different from the other mothers – she unequivocally loathes all animals, unless they are in a palatable format, like her chicken parmesan.
In Britain, a hatred for pets is unheard of, any bitterness towards animals is considered completely unacceptable. After all, we are considered a zoophilist nation. Throughout lockdown, pet ownership has surged. According to statistics from the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association, there are now 34m pets in the UK including 12m cats and 12m dogs, along with 3.2m small mammals, such as guinea pigs and hamsters, 3m birds and 1.5m reptiles.

The idea that Asian players are signed for commercial reasons should be a bit noughties. There was much talk of Junichi Inamoto making millions for Arsenal when the Japanese midfielder arrived in 2001 but whereas his signing was big news in east Asian football circles, his departure after making no league appearances was barely noticed.
These days most in Europe surely recognise that imports from the east are usually pretty good (like players of all nationalities who make big moves overseas, some fail to settle while others thrive) yet the notion that they also have in their proverbial lockers equally impressive abilities to sell shirts and turn a hefty percentage of those four billion or so Asians into fans of their new club seems to persist.

The Magpie River winds majestically through the forests of Quebec for nearly 200 miles. Its thundering ribbon of blue is cherished by kayakers, white-water rafters and the indigenous Innu people of Ekuanitshit. Earlier this year, in a first for Canada, the river was granted legal personhood by local authorities, and given nine rights, including the right to flow, the right to be safe from pollution – and the right to sue.
Uapukun Mestokosho, a member of the Innu community who campaigned for the recognition of the Magpie’s rights said spending time on the river was “a form of healing” for indigenous people who could revive their traditional land-based practices that had been abandoned during the violence of the colonial era. “People are suffering a lot, with intergenerational traumas linked to the past,” Mestokosho told CBC. As well as this benefit for people, she said that her ancestors had always protected the Magpie, known as the Muteshekau-shipu, in the past, and a recognition of its rights would help protect it for future generations.

There’s a disconcerting silence outside Jeanette Winterson’s London pied-a-terre. It’s the morning after the night before, when she travelled across London after dinner with her publisher to scenes of football fans setting the city alight with their cup final fervour. “It was uproar,” she says, “We saw cars on fire.” Her flat is in the East End district of Spitalfields in a Georgian house, which she bought 25 years ago, complete with a little shop that she ran for years as an organic grocer and tea room until the rates got too high, and she let it out to an upmarket chocolatier.
It’s as if a scene from Dickens’s The Old Curiosity Shop has been dropped into a satire about prosperity Britain: the quaint old shopfront is still intact, while outside it a lifesize sculpture of a rowing boat full of people sits surreally in the middle of the street, and a little further along, a herd of large bronze elephants frolics. These public artworks only arrived a few weeks ago, Winterson explains, as part of a grand plan to pedestrianise the area, and make it more buzzy, just at the moment that the sort of well-heeled office workers who bought upmarket chocolates are abandoning it owing to the Covid pandemic.

April De Angelis and Lucy Rivers bring 18th-century London to scabrous life in their boozy new musical satire with an excellent ensemble
The opening number is a front-of-curtain belter. Four women in ragged gowns brandish finger cymbals, guitar, accordion and washboard. They are disarrayed, dishevelled and, if their enthusiastic encomiums to “gin, gin, gin” are anything to go by, thoroughly disreputable. One of their less scabrous couplets pairs “nasty tumour” with “sense of humour” – you get the tone. This new musical from the freshly paired duo, writer April De Angelis and composer Lucy Rivers (with shared credits for lyrics), brazenly delivers what the publicity promises: “a booze-soaked love ballad from the women of Gin Lane” – think Cabaret relocated to Hogarth’s 18th-century London, with added vim and sharper bite.
Curtain rise reveals a skeletal, two-level set. Designer Hayley Grindle’s assemblage of scaffolding bars draped with ropes, and darkened-alleyway lighting by Jack Knowles, goosebumpingly evoke another kind of scaffold. Tinkling Handelian keyboard and strings introduce counterpoints musical and moral: a pair of bewigged, frock-coated men sing the praises of beer, condemn the vice of gin – they’re former dramatist and novelist turned licensing-laws-enforcing magistrate Henry Fielding (Alex Mugnaioni) and his brother, John (Peter Pearson), wrily observed by sister Sarah, also a novelist (Rachel Winters).

I found a photo online said to be of the vandalised Marcus Rashford mural, taken before it was covered up by locals because of reports it was racist. The seventh word of the eight-word screed looked to me like the word “black”, although it was partially obscured by the right testicle of an ejaculating penis and testicles combination that had been sprayed over the word, presumably by the same sloppy artist. In these volatile times there is a need for absolute clarity!

When Unesco decided last week to strip Liverpool of its world heritage status, its action was widely seen as a conflict between a remote bureaucracy and the city’s valiant efforts to regenerate its postindustrial zones. “Liverpool’s waterfront has flourished without Unesco’s support and will do so again,” wrote the Liverpool Echo’s head of sport, David Prentice, and he spoke for many.
The fact that a proposed new stadium for Everton is a catalyst for Unesco’s ire gives force to this narrative. On the one hand, the people’s game – or the “people’s club” as Everton like to call themselves – on the other, faceless functionaries meeting in a faraway country. In Fuzhou, China, to be precise, where the 44th session of the world heritage committee decided the city’s fate in a secret ballot. “Unesco are as out of touch with Merseyside geographically as they are spiritually,” Prentice wrote.

I have been fascinated by insects all my life. One of my earliest memories is of finding, at the age of five or six, some stripy yellow-and-black caterpillars feeding on weeds in the school playground. I put them in my empty lunchbox, and took them home. Eventually they transformed into handsome magenta and black moths. This seemed like magic to me – and still does. I was hooked.
In pursuit of insects I have travelled the world, from the deserts of Patagonia to the icy peaks of Fjordland in New Zealand and the forested mountains of Bhutan. I have watched clouds of birdwing butterflies sipping minerals from the banks of a river in Borneo, and thousands of fireflies flashing in synchrony at night in the swamps of Thailand. At home in my garden in Sussex I have spent countless hours watching grasshoppers court a mate and see off rivals, earwigs tend their young, ants milk honeydew from aphids, and leaf-cutter bees snip leaves to line their nests.

Blackpool-born David Thewlis, 58, studied acting at Guildhall school of music and drama. His breakout role was the lead in Mike Leigh’s 1993 film Naked, for which he won the best actor award at Cannes. Subsequent film credits include The Big Lebowski, Wonder Woman and I’m Thinking of Ending Things. He played Professor Remus Lupin in five Harry Potter films and, on TV, was Emmy-nominated for Fargo. His second novel is now being published.
Your new novel, Shooting Martha, is about a celebrated film director mourning his dead wife. Where did that premise come from?
Originally it was a screenplay idea. But when I was making a film called Guest of Honour with [Armenian-Canadian auteur] Atom Egoyan, we formed a lovely friendship. He read my treatment, we went out for dinner and he said “You know what? It’s a terrific idea but I think it’s a novel.” I went home that night and started writing in my notebook straight away. Turning it into a novel freed me up to invent a broader world than a low-budget film. It also became much more humorous than I’d envisioned this serious Hitchcockian film to be. I’m naturally drawn to things with a darkly funny vein running through them. Life is at once tragic and comic, so I find black comedy is honest and real.

Nothing about the time or the place I was brought up in imbued in me any affection for Margaret Thatcher or the government she led.

In the 1990s, I became one of the thousands who reluctantly submitted to Norman Tebbit’s sneering injunction to get on our bikes and move to where the work was, a migration south that I never sought and still resent.

This is part two of a two-part series, read part one here


Products spring out from the walls of Veracruz Mexican market in Monroe, Wisconsin: packets of cinnamon sticks, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, tiny rainbow-colored sprinkles, chicle; a wall of healthcare like anxiety pills and vitamins for energy, and a shelf devoted entirely to various forms of muscle pain relief. A large meat case full of Mexican specialties, such as longaniza. Piñatas. Maíz. Jarritos. Chicharrones. And rosquillas, a treat in between a cracker and a cookie which is what newly arrived immigrants ask for most often, says Maribel Lobato. She and her husband Santos Tinoco have owned the store for 13 years in Monroe, a small city in Green county about 40 miles south of Madison. 
The couple are often first contact for an increasing number of Latinos who immigrate to Monroe – which is 95% white – to work on dairy farms. “We can see the new faces because we know all the Latinos in Monroe,” says Lobato. She offers them donated furniture, clothes, a way to connect to home. An InterCambio Express telephone for sending money sits beneath an advertisement for a $19/hour job at a cheese factory, “but this place requires good papers”, customers in the store say in Spanish.

One thing they don’t tell you about mammies is that when they die you get new trousers. On my first full day as a half-orphan, I remember fiddling with unfamiliar cords as Margaret held my cheek and told me Mammy was a flower. She and her husband, Phillie, were close friends of my parents and their presence is one of the few memories that survive from that period, most specifically the conversation Margaret had with me there and then. “Sometimes,” croaked Margaret in a voice bent ragged from two days’ crying, “when God sees a particularly pretty flower, He’ll take it up from Earth, and put it in his own garden.”
It was nice to think that Mammy was so well-liked by God, since she was a massive fan. She went to all his gigs – mass, prayer groups, marriage guidance meetings. She had all the action figures – small Infant of Prague statuettes, much larger Infant of Prague statuettes, little blue plastic flasks of holy water in the shape of God’s own mammy herself. So, in one sense, Margaret’s version of events was kind of comforting. It placed my mother’s death in that category of stories where people met their heroes.

If you ask Maurizio Carta what the mafia looks like, he will take you to the residential areas of the Sicilian capital of Palermo. There, hundreds of desolate, nondescript grey apartment blocks scar the suburbs and a vast part of the historic centre.
It is the result of a building frenzy of the 1960s and 1970s, when Vito Ciancimino, a mobster from the violent Corleonesi clan, ordered the demolition of splendid art nouveau mansions to make space for brutalist tower blocks, covering vast natural and garden areas with tonnes of concrete. It is one of the darkest chapters in the postwar urbanisation of Sicily, and would go down in history as the “sack of Palermo”.

They say China, Russia, Brazil and Australia all have energy policies associated with 5C rises in atmospheric temperatures, a heating hike that would bring devastation to much of the planet.
The analysis, by the peer-reviewed group Paris Equity Check, raises serious worries about the prospects of key climate agreements being achieved at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in three months. The conference – rated as one of the most important climate summits ever staged – will attempt to hammer out policies to hold global heating to 1.5C by agreeing on a global policy for ending net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.

The town of Palm Beach in Florida, the crime writer Carl Hiaasen has observed, “is one of the few places left in America where you can still drive around in a Rolls-Royce convertible and not get laughed at.” It’s an unironic island, filled with the super-rich and famous, plastic surgeons and, of course, the former US president, Donald Trump, who holds court at his ostentatious Mar-a-Lago resort.
A satellite of Miami, the island prides itself on its many flamboyant charity balls, but no amount of good-cause fundraising can remove the whiff of corruption that hangs heavy in the subtropical air. If money talks in most places, in Palm Beach it speaks with a confident authority that’s seldom questioned. Never has that understanding been more egregiously demonstrated than in the case of the inscrutable financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

With the school term finally over, Britons are flying to Europe in their tens of thousands, record levels for this Covid year. They are arriving in countries where the Delta variant paralysing Britain is just becoming dominant – and Europe is responding by clamping down.
Some countries have tightened border controls, with Malta barring entry to unvaccinated travellers and Germany bringing in stricter quarantine rules for people arriving from Spain and the Netherlands. More broadly, authorities from Greece to Italy and France to Portugal are bringing in what are effectively vaccine passports for a wide range of activities, although most are shying away from using that term, which has become incendiary.

The widespread reliance on air conditioning in the US is explored in Eric Dean Wilson’s book After Cooling: on Freon, Global Warming, and the Terrible Cost of Comfort. The book explores how air conditioning has become one of the most effective ways to cool off – and explains how harmful chemicals that make our lives comfortable also contribute to the climate crisis.
The modern refrigerant – gas in fridges, freezers and air conditioners – was first introduced in 1930s in the form of a chemical called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), better known as Freon. This chemical escaped into the air over time, ripping a hole in the ozone layer. In 1987, a global agreement was reached to ban the production of CFCs – although every year an ozone hole reappears over Antarctica in October.

Clare Devlin’s first memory of being sadistically and sexually snared by her father was when she was seven. But she knows that wasn’t the first time it had happened. She remembers a feeling of dread of something already known, a “recognition of feelings of fear and anger and grief”. The abuse continued throughout her childhood and adolescence until she finally found a way to stop the man who was the most powerful person in her universe.
Her father, Patrick Devlin, was one of the most celebrated judges in the country. Now Clare is 81 years old and, with her family’s support, she is going public about his behaviour, lending herself to the international movement to stop child sexual abuse. As well as telling her story to the Observer, she has also made a submission to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which finishes taking evidence in October.

Charlie Phillips took this picture near his home in London’s Notting Hill in 1968. Looking back, he guesses that the man in the zoot suit had recently arrived from the Caribbean; the style, fashionable among the Windrush generation, was then on the way out. Phillips himself arrived from Jamaica in 1955. He worked washing pots in his parents’ restaurant in the Portobello Road and took photos of his community, initially with a Kodak Retina camera left behind by an American soldier. Simon Schama has called him “one of Britain’s great photo-portraitists… a visual poet; chronicler, champion, witness of a gone world”.
It was only after Phillips gave up taking pictures, however, with the arrival of digital photography, that he received any recognition. In the 1960s and 1970s, he would continually knock on editors’ doors and never receive any work. The most common question he was asked, he says, was: “Did you really take that?” as if a black photographer could not be so accomplished. In 2003, his archive from the 1960s was “discovered” by the Museum of London. It was stored under his bed, much of it lost in various house moves. Before that, he had shown his pictures mostly in barber’s shops in his community. This image is included in a new show of his archive at the Royal Festival Hall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fastest woman Britain has ever seen is also thoughtful, inspirational and willing to talk about things that athletes often avoid, like politics and periods. But in the countdown to the Tokyo Olympics, sprinter Dina Asher-Smith knows that every second counts
Around 9am local time, this coming Friday, Dina Asher-Smith will crouch on a starting line in Tokyo, ready for her first race of the Olympic Games. Nose this close to the ground, hugger-mugger with the other athletes, the moment will smell to her of skin cream and sweat, also the rubber of the track, a smell that might remind you or me of a playground’s springy surface, but which always makes Asher-Smith think of home. She has been a competitive sprinter since primary school. She started medalling in major 100m and 200m races about the time she was old enough to drive. Now, at 25, she is one of the fastest two or three women alive, and surely Britain’s best hope for athletics gold this summer.
On Friday morning, she’ll try to rid her mind of any such expectations. Crouched on the track she’ll place herself in an imaginary bubble, ignoring smells, impressions, sounds, even ready to ignore the echoing pop of the starter’s pistol. Wastes time, Asher-Smith has learned, listening for that. Better to try to feel the gun go and in the very same instant go herself. Ballerina focus will be required, next, to recreate a precise pattern of initial steps that she’ll have planned in advance with her coach. That ought to be the end of any conscious effort on her part. Over the next eight or nine seconds in a 100m race, or the next 20-something seconds in a 200m race, she says: “I shouldn’t really know what the sensations are. I shouldn’t be in a place to be reflective at all. I shouldn’t be feeling, only doing.”

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Jeremy Farrar is the director of the Wellcome Trust, a former professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). He has just published his account of the Covid crisis – Spike: The Virus v the People - in which he attacks the government for delaying a lockdown last autumn and describes the scientific and medical efforts that went into combating the pandemic.
At the beginning of the book, you say you initially believed that the virus might have leaked from a Chinese lab. Do you now reject that theory? And is there anything China could do to end that line of speculation?
You cannot absolutely, categorically, determine where the virus came from. But I do think that the balance of scientific evidence points strongly in favour of a natural origin, though you cannot totally rule out laboratory accidents. In order to do that, you’d have to find the intermediate animal host. And that could be one of thousands of different species of animals. It’s a needle in the haystack. What could China do? If it were to totally open up its laboratories, laboratory books and all its data… but I’m not even sure that would convince the doubters. But it would be great to have more transparency on all sides.

Herrington, a Dutch sustainability researcher and adviser to the Club of Rome, a Swiss thinktank, has made headlines in recent days after she authored a report that appeared to show a controversial 1970s study predicting the collapse of civilization was – apparently – right on time.

My dilemma is how to avoid getting burnt out again. I love my job and get an enormous amount of satisfaction, kudos, legitimacy and engaged interest. I gain not wholly but a large part of my identity from it.

There is no glittering river running down the middle of Raleigh Road, in Bristol’s Southville district. There are no Arctic snowfields of white linen dressing the tables. The dining room is not polluted by braying parties of media plutocrats of a sort that might make even the most ardent pacifist think ugly, violent thoughts. As a result of these things, the prices will not quite make you wince, like someone has poked a vinegar-dipped finger into a recently incurred wound. Or to put it another way, no one would look at the humble, whitewashed space housing Sonny Stores, on a corner in residential Bristol, and mistake it for the famed River Café. Until the food starts arriving. And then: oh my. Gosh. And thank you.

The health secretary announced on Saturday that he had made a “full recovery” from Covid-19 after falling ill eight days ago, and said: “Please, if you haven’t yet, get your jab, as we learn to live with, rather than cower from, this virus.”

Heralding its inquiry into the treatment of women in the armed forces as one of the most vital in its history, the defence subcommittee said 62% of the 4,106 veterans and current female personnel who gave testimony had either witnessed or received “unacceptable behaviour”.

Taxpayers will be left facing “significant financial risk for decades to come” because of the levels of emergency government spending on the pandemic, totalling more than £370bn, a powerful committee of MPs says today.
In two separate reports, the all-party public accounts committee (PAC) paints a daunting picture of the lasting financial strain caused by the first 16 months of combating Covid-19, and says the government must not wait until after the official inquiry to learn the lessons of what went wrong.

An emergency government plan to prevent the spiralling “pingdemic” from hitting food supplies has descended into chaos, with industry leaders condemning the scheme as an “absolute disaster” that has done more harm than good.
As train services were also disrupted on Saturday by the number of workers self-isolating, airports reported long queues at passport controls and the hospitality industry warned of a summer of closures, Downing St defied growing calls to bring forward a full relaxation of quarantine rules from the scheduled date of 16 August.

To understand the type of character Tottenham have hired in Fabio Paratici it helps to turn back the clock to 2013. The man appointed by Spurs last month as their managing director of football was then in a similar role at Juventus and he had the signing of Carlos Tevez in his sights.
Tevez was with Manchester City and when Paratici decided the moment had come to buy him he devised a plan: a secret meeting with the striker was arranged at a London restaurant opened specially for him at 1am. Paratici can accurately be described as an inventive workaholic utterly determined in his pursuit of success.

Courtney Lawes colossal in Lions victory

One down, two to play. There were moments when the British & Irish Lions were swaying on the brink but, to their immense collective credit, they dug in to secure the most priceless of first Test victories. Not for 83 years have the Lions overturned a bigger half-time deficit against major southern hemisphere opposition and a first series win in South Africa this century is now a mere 80 minutes away.
Few could have foreseen the final outcome when South Africa trotted in 12-3 ahead at the interval with their so-called ‘Bomb Squad’ available to rumble on in the second half. Instead the Boks’ best-laid plans blew up in their faces as the Lions superior fitness and the home side’s recent shortage of match practice combined to turn the contest completely. Warren Gatland’s selection and modus operandi, not for the first time, proved spot on.

The International Olympic Committee reported that 69.4 million people in Japan, about half of the population, had watched some part of the Games on TV – far higher than expectations. Thousands also defied calls to stay at home during the men’s cycle road race and lined the streets to cheer and applaud the riders.

Still mired in the well-documented protests and controversy, the first official day of the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics finally arrived. It was time to sit in front of the television and embrace your inner couch potato as, across the main Olympics channels (BBC, Eurosport, Discovery+), you watched people fitter than you could ever be achieve things you could never achieve.
The Tokyo Games are mainly devoid of spectators: for the opening ceremony, the 68,000-capacity stadium had 950 guests, with dignitaries including President Emmanuel Macron of France and the US first lady, Jill Biden. Viewers had to become acclimatised to vast, eerily empty stadiums full of new, shiny but unused flip seats, just as athletes had to get used to the sweltering temperatures and humidity.

Judge him by the standards that are meant to have guided his life, and you find that Boris Johnson is a monumental fraud.
Yet no one contemplating the autocratic control his government is awarding itself has said that his transformation from celebrity journalist into secret policeman needs explaining. The one principle even his sternest critic would expect him to defend was a free press. Yet there he is threatening to censor and imprison like a part-time Putin.

William Buick talked of Adayar’s “endless power” after Charlie Appleby’s colt became the first Derby winner for 20 years to follow up in the King George & Queen Elizabeth Stakes here. Even from half a furlong away in the grandstand, it was possible for nearly 15,000 racegoers to sense what Buick was feeling through his reins.
Adayar hit the front at the top of the straight and once he had reached maximum speed there was never a moment when his stride threatened to shorten. Mishriff attempted to get alongside before Love, the 13-8 favourite, tried to summon a challenge to extend her winning streak in Group One contests to five.

Author Leïla Slimani, 39, grew up in Rabat, Morocco, and moved to Paris when she was 17. Her first novel, Adèle, a melancholy story about a nymphomaniac mother in her 30s, was published in France in 2014. In 2016, she was the first Moroccan woman to win France’s most prestigious literary award, the Prix Goncourt, for her second novel, Lullaby, about a nanny who kills the baby and toddler in her care. In 2017, President Emmanuel Macron appointed her as his personal representative for promoting French language and culture.
Last year, Slimani published a nonfiction book, Sex and Lies, a collection of intimate testimonies from Moroccan women about their secret lives. Her latest book, The Country of Others, is the first novel in a planned trilogy based on her family history. Set in the late 1940s and 50s, it centres on her maternal grandparents during Morocco’s period of decolonisation. Slimani lives with her husband and two children in Paris.

For Georginio Wijnaldum, it came to feel like a divide and it was entirely stark, shaping what was a tumultuous climax to his time at Liverpool. On one side, there was Jürgen Klopp and the players, together with the matchgoing fans, while on the other, there was the Fenway Sports Group ownership and the club’s followers on social media.
Wijnaldum felt only love and support from the former and he will never forget the Anfield send-off they afforded him during and after the final game of last season against Crystal Palace. The 30-year-old midfielder’s contract was due to expire and it had been clear for some time that he would depart as a free agent. The only question concerned where he would go and that was answered last month when Paris Saint-Germain stepped in front of Barcelona to secure him on a three-year deal.

First, more technically, the message confuses two types of averages. As children learn at school, the median means that if you lined up the women according to the age they had died of Covid-19, the woman in the middle would be 85. But life expectancy is a mean-average – you work out how long, say, 100,000 newborns are likely to live assuming that current mortality rates continue, add them up and divide by 100,000. Using data from the UK for 2017-19, life expectancy at birth is 79 for men and 83 for women, but the median age at death is slightly higher: 81 for men and 85 for women, the same as that quoted for Covid-19.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær has little patience for those who complain about the frequent presence of rain clouds in the skies above north-west England. “We have a saying in Norway that there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing,” says Manchester United’s manager.
When Solskjær took caretaker charge of United in December 2018, Sir Alex Ferguson’s one-time super-sub striker swiftly decided the squad was dressed inadequately and inappropriately for the task in hand.

As founders of Skip Gallery, an installation concept bringing art to unusual places, they decided to right this wrong. The resultant group show, Bums , featuring David Shrigley and Xu Yang among others, is now at Dio Horia gallery, Mykonos, Greece, and in London later this year. 
“These are the largest muscles in the body, responsible for posture and weight-bearing,” says Borowski. ‘This is often overlooked because of our obsession with the sexual and silly side of the bottom. Our exhibition is a celebration of the many facets of bums.’

“I hope that I do a lot of good, but unfortunately in the short term, I inflict a lot of pain with cancer surgery,” says Sodergren. “So we’re reliant on pretty nasty painkillers, such as high-strength intravenous opioids, which we’re trying to move away from.

It’s very appreciated.”
Aw, shucks. Thanks, Jeff. In a post-flight press conference he declared that the venture had reinforced his commitment to tackling the climate crisis and using his project as a stepping stone towards colonising space for the benefit of Earth. “We’re going to build a road to space,” he said, “so our kids, and their kids, can build the future. This is not about escaping Earth … this is the only good planet in the solar system and we have to take care of it. When you go to space and see how fragile it is you want to take care of it even more.”

I’m in the pub on a Thursday and I’m complaining, again, about Yet Another Person Getting Married. My friend and I do the familiar dance, rattling through our arsenal of stock opinions about why marriage is trash. Intellectually. Emotionally. Imaginatively. Sexually. Historically. Everythingally. We laugh, we talk about “the normals”, we joke about wedding fairs and anodyne idiots who spend thousands on their weddings, but are too strapped to give to the local food bank. Then we finish our £5.80 guest pale ale and leave, smug intellectual folk who’ve got one over on Big Society and the thwarted plans it had for us. But as I wave goodbye, my sense of satisfaction wanes.
Because I’ve been lying. The truth is, I’m desperate to get married. The truth is, all I want, really, is to slot into that statistic – to be another second in the ticking clock of weddings. I’ve always wanted it: I made a stunning, plump bride on the playground in primary school; I planned my offensively gay wedding to the letter throughout my teens; I wept over men who left me at university as the potential for marriage leaked out of my life; and I spent four years on what I told a friend was my Wedding Diet. We laughed, but I was deadly serious.

The Torre Guinigi in Lucca, Italy, is a brick medieval tower – it’s handsome, but of a type common enough in historic Tuscan cities. What makes it special is a grove of holm oaks growing from its summit. Trees come with expectations, such that they are rooted in the ground, yet there they are, high in the air, apparently flourishing. The tower would be less interesting if it weren’t for the trees and the trees would be less interesting if it weren’t for the tower.
So there’s something compelling about trees in unexpected places. Hence at least part of the appeal of the High Line in New York, where gardens grow on an old elevated railway line, and of the ski slope on top of the Amager Bakke power plant in Copenhagen. There’s been a thing for wrapping towers in vegetation in recent years. Little Island, the micro-park recently created by Thomas Heatherwick over the Hudson, has a similar well-I-never, Instagram-able impact.

Last week, the double Paralympic world champion Olivia Breen shared a story of an incident at the English Athletics Championships. When she had just finished her long jump competition, a female official said “my sprint shorts were too short and inappropriate”, she wrote. “I was left speechless... they are specifically designed for competing in.” She has said she is planning to make an official complaint.
Over in Bulgaria, at the only Euros I am ready to talk about, the Norwegian women’s beach handball team were fined €1,500 (£1,285), or €150 a player, for “a case of improper clothing”. In this case of improper clothing, which sounds like a lost Murder She Wrote episode, the Norwegian women found that their shorts were not skimpy enough. The rules stated that they should have been wearing bikini bottoms “with a close fit and cut on an upward angle toward the top of the leg”, rather than the shorts they chose to compete in instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mads Mikkelsen is the enthusiastically violent avenger, with top back-up support, in Anders Thomas Jensen’s darkly funny new movie
A former military man is driven to avenge the death of his wife with brutal, at times overly enthusiastic efficiency. It’s a fairly generic revenge movie premise. However, in the hands of Danish director and co-writer Anders Thomas Jensen (the man behind transgressive black comedy Men & Chicken), the revenge movie takes a swerve into more unexpected territory. Jensen’s approach has always been to push the limits of acceptable subjects for comedy, and this is no exception. Violence aside, there are some moments – I hesitate to call them gags – dealing with sexual abuse that venture into pretty dark places, comedically speaking. Others are gloriously absurd. We laugh, partly, from relief at escaping the unimaginable.
The reliably excellent Mads Mikkelsen channels the rigid black-and-white certainties of military man Markus. But in this case it’s his co-stars Nikolaj Lie Kaas (as probability geek Otto), Lars Brygmann (hacker and barn enthusiast Lennart) and in particular Nicolas Bro (rage-filled tech-nerd Emmenthaler) who steal this very violent, very funny and oddly life-affirming film.

Peaty promised there was plenty more in the tank after winning his heat in 57.56sec – nearly a quarter of a second clear of his closest rival Arno Kamminga of the Netherlands – but accepted that it had been an unusual experience given the lack of crowds.

Nobody could believe it when I once used the men’s toilet at a petrol station. I was on tour. Our bus had stopped for us to get snacks and use the loo, but there was a huge line for the ladies’ and my impatience is really bad, so I refused to wait. I walked right past everybody, into the men’s, used a stall and came out.

Is he miming? Are his band miming too? In a ‘live stream’ first for the 80-year-old troubadour, Dylan plays fast and loose with stagecraft – and his vast back catalogue – and it’s completely thrilling
At the start of When I Paint My Masterpiece, the first song of Bob Dylan’s live stream, you can hear a mouth organ. But no one is playing harmonica – at least not visibly. Not Dylan, commanding the stage at what looks like a prohibition-era speakeasy, nor any of his four-piece band: masked, young, diverse. And so begins Shadow Kingdom – an enigma wrapped in a visually stunning conundrum masquerading as a livestreamed performance: Dylan’s first. Originally available to rewatch for just 48 hours after broadcast, you can now still buy the stream until 4am Monday 26 July (expires 8am).
It’s not a concert, but a heady simulacrum of the perfect gig. Some nicely turned-out punters sit at tables nursing tumblers of drink and smoking like it’s mandatory: the luckiest extras in film. The credits thank a certain Bon Bon Club, Marseille. There is no such club in Marseille, but there was one in Philadelphia in the 60s, notorious for a racketeering scandal, according to one US Dylan-watcher.

When Martha Skye Murphy was three, she would stand up on tables and sing at family birthday parties. Her big break came when she belted out Cat Power’s Free in front of her parents’ friend John Hillcoat, who was directing the 2005 film The Proposition, soundtracked by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. Cave had told Hillcoat he would like a child to sing the opening credits for the film, and so began Murphy’s mentorship under Cave. As well as vocals for The Proposition soundtrack, she contributed to his 2013 album Push the Sky Away.
Three EPs into her career, the London-based songwriter and actor relishes suspending her audience between euphoria and unease. Murphy likens it to a duel. “It’s not easy listening – you are being activated and being guided through an experience that doesn’t allow you to come up for air until it’s over,” she says. Her single Found Out, released last month, features a distorted bass – sparring partner to her airy, Kate Bush-like vocals. In her latest collaboration, with the Brighton band Squid on their single Narrator, Murphy portrays a woman defying what she deems the male character’s “dominating story”. Midway through the track, pleasure jackknifes into pain,her whispers spiralling into a shriek, dragging us into the beautiful fray.

A decade ago, ordering a negroni was “a secret handshake, a sign to bartenders that you knew what you liked, and how to order it”, according to Bon Appétit magazine. In 2013, GQ magazine wrote that “a negroni, like black coffee or Texas, is an acquired taste”. A negroni is made up of equal parts gin, vermouth and Campari, the herbaceous scarlet liqueur that, according to Italian bar wisdom, begins to taste good the third time you drink it. Its botanical bitterness seemed destined to keep the negroni forever pigeonholed as an insider’s drink.
Fast-forward to summer 2021, and it has gone from arthouse to blockbuster. At the smart new rooftop gin terrace of the St Pancras hotel in London, the negroni gets headline billing on the drinks menu, ahead of the gin and tonic. You can buy negroni ready-mixed in a can for a train journey, or send a letterbox cocktail as a gift. You can mix a snowgroni (a frozen, slushy-style negroni) or order a pineapple negroni at happy hour. Head to the menswear department of Marks & Spencer and you can even pick up a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan “Negroni” above a cheery illustration of a tumbler full to the brim with cherry-red liquid.

From 1972-79, I was a pupil at King Edward’s school, Birmingham. It was at that time a direct grant school, which meant that although most of the places (including mine) were not fee-paying, it had all the trappings of a public school. It was single-sex, the teachers wore academic gowns, the assembly hall was called “Big School”, we played rugby rather than football, and there were two school songs, one of them in Latin. It was an elitist school, and many of my more clued-up, politically aware friends were aware of this.
I wasn’t. My head was in the clouds and all I was interested in was books, music, film and TV. At the age of 15 I started writing novels and the second one, called Half Asleep; Half Awake, was set in a thinly fictionalised version of the school.

And it all started so smoothly, too. A frictionless dawn trip through the Olympic labyrinth, navigating all those buses and badges and scans and forms and apps and depots and checkpoints, two temperature checks, a ticketing desk, a list cross-referenced with an email verification, a bag scan and a pat down. The huge and intricate machinery of the Tokyo Games had come to life, tens of thousands of journalists and athletes and officials whizzing hither and thither from hotel to transport hub to, in my case, Tokyo Bay and Shizuma Park. This was the venue of Japan’s match against the Czech Republic in the women’s beach volleyball, the opening game on the opening morning of the Olympics.
There’s always a nervous uncertainty on the first morning. This time, inevitably, there was a little extra anxiety, the mutual paranoia of people pressed up together in close proximity again. This was soon cut through by all the enthusiastic smiles and shouts of “Ohayo!” and “Welcome!” from friendly volunteers with no one else to talk to. Then I met an Australian: “Have you not heard the news mate? The match has been cancelled. One of the Czech players tested positive.” I did wonder why I’d had the 7am bus to the venue all to myself.

For the second time in my adult life, I feel we must have a national conversation about domestic compulsory ID. Last time, in the mid-00s, it was an authoritarian solution looking for a problem to fix, with immigration, benefit fraud and everything but climate change proffered as justification. This time the problem posed by the government’s catastrophic “economy first” approach to pandemic management is all too clear. Still, the introduction of an internal passport will be just as costly, divisive and counterproductive as before – and even more dangerous to any way of life worth fighting for beyond this terrible time.
Many people will have watched the government flip-flopping over whether some kind of public or commercially sourced proof of vaccination status should be required before access to a whole host of everyday activities from attending a nightclub or sports event to a trip to the pub or the shops. There have been similarly mixed messages about whether the introduction of such a regime should be left to businesses to decide on and regulate for themselves.

In the north-east Spanish region of Catalonia, an enormous bull called Pedro is poking his head over a barn door to look at some sheep. He’ll stay there for two hours if the sanctuary volunteers let him; he’ll have to be tempted away with treats so that the sheep can be let out to graze. Pedro knows the routine; he’s been here since he was a calf, when he was bottle-fed by volunteers. He lives a charmed life – he is fed, he roams, he watches sheep, he sleeps; and when he dies, it will be of natural causes.
“He’s enormous!” I say to Olivia Gómez de Zamora, a veterinary assistant from Madrid who spends a lot of time coaxing Pedro from the barn.

Only 23 of the top 50 men’s singles players made the trip here, a reflection of the competition’s confused place in a sport already bursting with major tournaments each year. What has always been clear, though, is that most those taking part have arrived determined to leave with a medal.
Few value it as much as two-times singles gold medallist Andy Murray, and alongside the formidable Joe Salisbury the British pair rose to the occasion in their first match together, dismantling the second seeds, Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut of France, 6-3, 6-2.

“Dinosaurs, robots and honeybees. I don’t know why, but everyone is fascinated,” says Richard Glassborow, chair of the London Beekeepers’ Association (LBKA). When it comes to beekeeping, what was once a niche hobby has flourished, especially in Britain’s cities.
But there is growing concern from scientists and experienced beekeepers that the vast numbers of honeybees, combined with a lack of pollinator-friendly spaces, could be jeopardising the health and even survival of some of about 6,000 wild pollinators across the UK. Last year, Kew Gardens’ State of the World’s Plant and Fungi report warned: “Campaigns encouraging people to save bees have resulted in an unsustainable proliferation in urban beekeeping. This approach only saves one species of bee, the honeybee, with no regard for how honeybees interact with other, native species.”

In March this year, photos of the government’s glitzy new briefing room, where Boris Johnson’s new media chief was set to host daily press conferences, leaked to the media. The centrepiece of a “presidential” approach to communications, it was already controversial for its cost to taxpayers of £2.6m. With its gaudy blue backdrop, giant union flags and imposing podium, it looked like the stage for a US political or legal TV show: The West Wing with a touch of Judge Judy.
What the briefing room needed was something to suck the pomposity out of it. What it needed, it turned out, was a cameo appearance from a 620-watt anthropomorphic vacuum cleaner. The stocky red and black appliance was barely visible in the wings, stage left, yet instantly recognisable. Turned away from the podium, his chrome wand propped casually against a varnished dado rail, the Henry vacuum cleaner looked almost as if he were rolling his eyes.

There’s nothing more peachy perfect than a perfectly ripe peach. However, a perfectly ripe peach is rarer than, say, a perfectly ripe avocado or banana. That’s because some fruits continue to ripen after they are picked, while others, peaches included, don’t. If you do have a proper ripe peach, my go-to recipe is simple: slice it up (or don’t) and eat it as it is. If your peach is slightly under-ripe and too firm, however, then baking, grilling or shaving are your friends. The fruit may not continue to ripen once it has been picked, but its sweetness is still in there, ready to be drawn out.

Lord help me, I am in the whirlwind throes of the beautiful game. Online chess. The ancient pastime enjoyed a boom late last year. And I got caught squarely in its blast. Chess.com, the internet’s leading chess platform, saw an eruption in activity, triggered by lockdown idleness and (my own personal inciting event) Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit, which landed in October 2020, and showed the world that chess is actually really cool. As long as you ignore the actual chess and focus instead on the narcotic-fuelled psychodrama of a very beautiful woman and put the kid from Love Actually in a cowboy hat, for some reason.
But there was enough actual chess in the show to reawaken my old love for the game. I’d played a lot as a child, as you can probably tell from my face. I played in the school club and entered competitions. I collected sets, including a Simpsons one and a Lord Of The Rings one, allowing me to play the pieces from one board against those of the other. No, I didn’t go out much as a kid. But how could I when I was busy battling the dark forces of Sauron with an army of Barts?

But what a year. Newly qualified to teach just as the Covid-19 pandemic was changing everything, they have been through a baptism of fire. They have had to manage virtual teaching, year group bubbles, and strict rules for hygiene and the use of equipment.

Sales of the bikes, which can carry heavy or bulky loads, are expected to jump by up to 60% in the UK in the year ahead, according to the association, boosted by various initiatives at local and national level to reduce carbon emissions and congestion.

Beware summer! The season we used to anticipate as the lightest, brightest, balmiest time of the year now comes with a health warning.
For the first time in the UK, the Met Office issued an extreme heat advisory this week. The warning was very staid, very British, but a clear shift away from the ethos of Keep Calm and Carry On. The amber alert urged precautions against adverse health effects for vulnerable populations, pressure on water resources, potential power cuts and increased likelihood of transport delays. Given the temperatures were only a little over 30C for a few days, this might seem risible to people living in far hotter parts of the world, but it is part of a growing global conversation that is fundamentally challenging how we think about summer in a climate-disrupted world.

Or an attempt at staying relevant to a generation that has become tired of traditional offerings? Or perhaps further evidence of the rampant commercialisation of the Games? It was probably a bit of all the above, but the first appearance at a Games is undeniably a watershed moment.
When the 40 competitors – a gender-equal cohort of 20 men and 20 women – paddle out into the waters off Tsurigasaki Beach on the morning of 25 July it will mark the culmination of a decades-long campaign by the International Surfing Association.

Then, in 1947, a stroke of brilliance: De Beers’ “A Diamond is Forever” campaign. The slogan was a hit. The market transformed. Today diamond engagement rings are ubiquitous, winking from the windows of upmarket jewellers.
Earlier this year came another glittering moment in diamond PR. Pandora, the world’s largest jewellery retailer, announced it would be switching entirely to lab-made diamonds. It generated positive headlines around the world, dubbed an “ethical stand against mined diamonds”.

In the distance, a small inflatable boat made its way to them carrying a New Zealand defence officer dressed in full protective gear and 12 precious boxes. Inside the boxes were just over 700 doses of Pfizer vaccine, enough to cover the 346 residents of Nukunono who are eligible for the vaccine.

The Great Barrier Reef will not be placed on a list of world heritage sites “in danger” after a global lobbying effort from Australia against the proposed listing.
The 21-country World Heritage Committee on Friday ignored a scientific assessment from the UN’s science and culture organisation, Unesco, that the reef was clearly in danger from climate change and so should be placed on the list.

England is facing weeks of disruption to bin collection, transport and food supply due to staff self-isolating, companies and councils have warned, amid concerns the 16 August date to lift quarantine for the double-vaccinated could be delayed.
No 10 was on Friday scrambling to set up a system to let more key workers take daily tests rather than isolate for 10-days, over fears that large parts of the economy could grind to a halt over the so-called “pingdemic”.

It is now 10 years since Amy Winehouse’s death at the age of 27, and Reclaiming Amy (BBC Two) is a short, sad, sweet film that sees her family and friends give their side of the singer’s complicated story. It is narrated by her mother Janis, and does not attempt to hide its position as a riposte to Asif Kapadia’s 2015 documentary Amy, which, Janis says, “claimed to tell the real story about our daughter”. The implication is that it did not, and certainly her father, Mitch, has reason to address some of the criticisms it levelled at him. Here, he claims he had a nervous breakdown after its release.
“The way Amy turned out wasn’t because she wasn’t raised right,” insists her lifelong friend, Michael, and we see plenty of clips of how she was raised. There are home videos and photographs of her on the day she was born, at three, at five. There is footage of her playing Rizzo in a school production of Grease, and her star power is plain to see even then. She practically blows the other Pink Ladies off the stage.

Five years after the contorted, controversial run-in to the Rio Olympic Games, Lizzie Deignan is happy to admit the contrast between then and now could hardly be greater. Since June 2016, when the Yorkshire rider endured a whereabouts controversy that was stymied by the court of arbitration for sport, and went on to finish fifth in Rio, she has married, given birth to her daughter Orla and returned to competition at the highest level.
Following all that with juggling family life and bike racing in the middle of a global pandemic does lend a certain degree of perspective, as she points out. “Personally and professionally I’m in a totally different place. I’m still very focused, I still want to win the race but my perspective on where it stands in the rest of my life is very different. I’m a lot more relaxed than going into Rio. Life’s good and I’m happy to be here.”

Gatland leads the Lions into the first Test against the Springboks on Saturday in the most challenging tour of his tenure given the Covid-19 backdrop, with outbreaks in both camps since the squad arrived in South Africa. Even before the pandemic, the tour had been trimmed down to eight matches in five weeks and the Lions secured the early release of England-based players for their training camp in Jersey only at the 11th hour.

Jehan Sadat, who has died aged 88 of cancer, spent most of her life promoting social justice and women’s rights in Egypt. She continued to campaign decades after her husband, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated, on 6 October 1981, by militants in the army avenging the imprisonment of fellow Islamists and condemning the 1978 Camp David accords that he had signed with Israel.
As a girl in Cairo, Jehan had explored the streets of her neighbourhood of Al-Manial, attributing her self-confidence to her supportive parents. She said that her fight against gender inequality started during her schooldays, when she was encouraged to focus on subjects such as sewing and cooking in preparation for marriage rather than the sciences that would lead to a university career. “I have always regretted that decision. I would never allow my daughters to close off their futures that way,” she wrote in her autobiography, A Woman of Egypt (1987).

Jadon Sancho is a £73m signing who may go down as a steal as his Manchester United career unfolds. Even before the former Borussia Dortmund forward pulls on the United shirt, his price appears akin to a Black Friday buy. 
For £8m more than a centre‑back, Rúben Dias, cost Manchester City, Ole Gunnar Solskjær acquires a 21-year-old who joins Mason Greenwood as a “generational” footballer who can light up the attack for a decade. If Sancho is integral to a 21st title for United, it will cast the fee as more apt with a decimal point between its digits.

Simone Biles’s iconic status is not afforded just because she is the gold medal favourite going into the Tokyo Olympics and the dominant force in women’s artistic gymnastics for a decade. Nor is it based on the fact she out-performs her peers and predecessors – male and female – in international medal counts. Rather, it is bestowed because the 24-year-old American is redefining what is possible in gymnastics.
Take her performance of what is one of the most difficult – and dangerous – moves in gymnastics: the Yurchenko double pike on the vault.

The launch of the government’s long-awaited disability strategy risks becoming a car crash if ministers do not do more to listen to the views of people with disabilities before releasing it, a Conservative peer has said.
Lord Shinkwin warned the prime minister that releasing a report that is roundly rejected by people with disabilities would greatly undermine his levelling-up agenda, after campaigners complained bitterly that the consultation process that informed it was seriously flawed.

Three years ago, England were in a pickle. Wary of the threat of Kuldeep Yadav in the upcoming Test series against India, they wanted to call up a left-arm wrist-spinner from the county game who could replicate Kuldeep’s unusual style in the nets. The problem: there weren’t any. In fact, left-arm wrist-spinners are so rare in English cricket that it has been more than half a century – since the days of Johnny Wardle and Donald Carr – since this country produced one of any repute. That is, until now.
Three years ago, Jake Lintott was being released by Gloucestershire and wondering if his last chance as a professional cricketer had come and gone. Making it as a spinner in county cricket is hard enough, but try being a 25-year-old unorthodox spinner bowling a style not seen in this country since Harold Wilson was in Downing Street. With a steady job coaching cricket at Queen’s College in Taunton, few could have blamed Lintott for giving up on his dream.

Setting the right emotional tone for the precursor to an Olympic Games being held in such extraordinary circumstances was always going to be a perilous exercise in not causing offence, to a world traumatised by a pandemic and to a host nation deeply uneasy about its moment in the spotlight.
An opening ceremony that overstated its tragic backdrop would have sent a curious message to thousands of athletes, confined inside an Olympic bubble, as they begin their quest for medals. Yet one that appeared to overtly celebrate the start of the world’s biggest sporting event would have come across as insensitive – even callous – in a week when daily Covid-19 cases in Tokyo reached their highest level for six months.

The global reality of the climate crisis could hardly be more stark. A common theme is clear, from western Germany, where about 200 people perished in floods, to Henan province in central China, where at least 50 have died and about 400,000 have been evacuated after overwhelming downpours, to western Canada and the US, where a blistering set of heatwaves has provided the tinder for wildfires on a growing scale, through to the Middle East, where drought threatens communities from Algeria to Yemen, triggering unrest and regional disputes. On this planet there is no hiding place.
A hundred days now remain before the nations gather in Glasgow at the United Nations Cop26 climate conference on 31 October. More than 190 world leaders are expected. The UK government calls the summit the world’s last best chance. That is true. Yet words are cheaper than actions and sustained effort, especially when Boris Johnson is involved, and the last best chance is at serious risk of being lost. As things currently stand, the governments of the world, the UK included, are heading to Glasgow without having made the ambitious strategic decisions and collective sacrifices that might enable Cop26 to mark a genuine turning point that is needed in the battle to contain and reverse global heating.

Tokyo Olympics – live updates

Amid the darkness of the Tokyo skyline, a moment of hope and raging illumination. After nearly four hours of an opening ceremony that veered from the sombre to the spectacular, the Olympic flame was passed to the face of these Games, Naomi Osaka. As the steps of the Mount Fuji stage opened up before her, Japan’s globally recognised tennis star jogged towards the summit, nodded, and then set the cauldron – and perhaps these troubled Tokyo 2020 Olympics – alight.
It was the culmination of a ceremony that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, Thomas Bach, promised would offer a “moment of hope” in a Covid-riven world.

After a year and a half of the pandemic, the world is short of causes for celebration. Diversion, spectacle and surprise may never have been more welcome. At a time of growing divisions between and within countries, shared interests and endeavours are welcome. Despite their muted atmosphere, the Olympics and Paralympics are likely to raise spirits internationally, with viewers cheering on extraordinary feats of human achievement.
Japan, however, has embarked on these events feeling anxious and resentful. The last Games in Tokyo, in 1964, epitomised and accelerated the country’s remarkable modernisation and reentry to the international community after the second world war. The 2020 Olympics were supposed to cement its resurgence from the horrors of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown 10 years ago. When postponed, they were rebranded as the moment the world would revel in its escape from Covid-19. But with the pandemic raging globally, the public fears increased infection or imported variants from tens of thousands of visitors descending upon a country where fewer than a quarter of people are fully vaccinated. A state of emergency is already in place in Tokyo, with cases at a six-month high.

The Olympics has claimed to be many things down the decades, most often a beacon of hope, cauldron of joy, saucerful of love and all the rest of it. As the opening ceremony at the Tokyo National Stadium began to wind down at around 11pm local time, Thomas Bach could be heard making a series of similar generic claims about the Games as a force for peace, tolerance and freedom, a speech he will no doubt repeat with a sense of furious reforming zeal at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

The governing body of Yew Tree primary school brought a judicial review against the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, after he refused to revoke an academy order imposed on the school in 2019, when it was rated inadequate by Ofsted.

Russia has named a local partner of the Bellingcat investigative journalism collective as a “foreign agent” in an apparent act of revenge for helping reveal the Kremlin’s role in the Salisbury poisonings and assassination attempts by the security agencies.
Russia’s justice ministry on Friday named the Insider, an investigative website, along with five journalists for other publications as “foreign agents”, a label that implied the news agencies and individual reporters were taking foreign money to influence Russian politics.

Charities have written to the prime minister calling for a new anti-waste, or “Amazon law”, to be introduced in the UK as the online retailer was forced to deny new allegations that it destroys in-date groceries – as well as household goods such as laptops and TVs.
Footage and photographs of Amazon’s Dunfermline depot in Fife, taken by one of its workers, appear to show boxes of groceries, including crisps, tinned food and soft drinks, being earmarked as waste. They included products with intact packaging that had not passed their best-before date, according to the video recordings obtained by ITV News and the Times newspaper.

Fifa’s ethics committee has issued a lifetime ban to the Haitian Football Federation’s (FHF’s) former head of referees Rosnick Grant, after finding him guilty of committing acts of sexual harassment and abuse.
Grant, who had his original provisional 90-day suspension extended in May, was also found to have abused his position and coerced young referees “to prevent the reporting of such sexual abuse”, according to a statement from the ethics committee’s independent adjudicatory chamber on Friday.

Chas Bayfield and Dave Jenner, both in their 50s and renowned creative directors at the J Walter Thompson (JWT) agency, were among five men axed from the agency, which is part of WPP, because bosses “urgently” wanted to address its poor gender pay gap, a tribunal court ruled.

Sixth-form student Ellie Gould, 17, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Griffiths, on 3 May 2019. Quantitative trading analyst Poppy Devey Waterhouse, 24, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Joe Atkinson, on 14 December 2018. Though these were frenzied attacks involving multiple injuries, and the killers tried to hide their crimes, the guidelines for murder sentencing meant that both received less than 20 years in prison. Atkinson got 16 years; Griffiths got 12 and a half years.

He identifies the ideology of extremist individualism that has broken the social contract that underpinned postwar Britain as a welfare state, and is now trying to dismantle our care and responsibility for each other.
They may not succeed in that, but we cannot go on pretending that there is no alternative to the market fundamentalist ideology that promises global disaster on at least two fronts.

What on earth will be achieved by a purge of four insignificant far-left groups barely known to most members of the Labour party (Keir Starmer expected to back purge of far-left Labour factions, 18 July)? It can only add grist to the mill of those who perceive a campaign to drive out former Jeremy Corbyn supporters. Political energy would be more profitably expended if it was put into efforts to bring the socialist and social democratic tendencies in the Labour party together behind a practical programme for government that all could support.
Purging a few fringe groups is a distraction from this much more urgent task.

After the shocking murders of Sarah Everard, Bibaa Henry, Nicole Smallman and many other women in the past year, the government has finally published its latest strategy to prevent violence against women and girls. We’ve had similar strategies in place in England since 2009, but the latest one has been delayed by over a year. It comes at a pivotal moment, in which the shared experiences of being a woman or girl – of being followed, harassed, assaulted and having freedoms curtailed because of the threat of men’s violence – has led to outpourings of anger and protests on the street.
The Home Office’s public call for evidence to inform its new strategy drew more than 180,000 responses, the vast majority after it reopened following Everard’s murder. It comes after last month’s government rape review, which carried an apology for the shamefully low rates of prosecutions, and the release of an Ofsted review that found that sexual harassment has become normalised in schools and colleges.

Build a hill and they will come. This, at least, is what Westminster council is betting on, having lavished £2m on a temporary mound. Rearing up at the western end of Oxford Street as a faceted green shell, looking like a landscape from a low-fi video game, the 25-metre high Marble Arch Mound is one of the more unlikely strategies for stimulating our Covid-stricken high streets.
“You have to give people a reason to come to an area,” says Melvyn Caplan, the council’s deputy leader. “They’re not just coming to Oxford Street for the shops any more. People are interested in experiences and destinations.” The pandemic has seen around 17% of stores on London’s most famous shopping street close completely.

If some politicians are to be believed, taking sweeping action to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement would be calamitous for jobs in the energy sector. But a study suggests that honouring the global climate target would, in fact, increase net jobs by about 8 million by 2050.
The study – in which researchers created a global dataset of the footprint of energy jobs in 50 countries including major fossil fuel-producing economies – found that currently an estimated 18 million people work in the energy industries, which is likely to increase to 26 million if climate targets are met.

Enter the hip thrust: this works your buttocks and hamstrings, both of which are important for posture. They also help movement and stability in the hips (great for runners). Hit a few sets to break up long stints behind your desk.

Yesterday, seemingly out of the blue, Jordan Peele announced the name and poster of his third movie. The film is called Nope and the poster is a picture of an ominous-looking storm cloud hovering above a mountain village. Do we know what it’s about? Nope. Do we have any sort of insight into the film whatsoever? Nope. Would it be a good idea for us to attempt to extrapolate the premise for the film using nothing but a one-word title and a picture of a cloud? Nope. Are we going to do it anyway? Sure, why not.

The actor Tommy Dorfman has confirmed that she is transgender. Dorfman, who played the gay cis-male character Ryan Shaver on the hit Netflix show 13 Reasons Why, told Time magazine: “I view today as a reintroduction to me as a woman, having made a transition medically … Today is about clarity: I am a trans woman. My pronouns are she/her. My name is Tommy.”
Dorfman told the interviewer, trans novelist Torrey Peters, that she had been “privately identifying and living as a woman – a trans woman” for a year. Over that period, the 29-year-old’s physical evolution has been chronicled on her Instagram feed, prompting online discussion about her body that Dorfman said “began to feel overwhelming”. In the Time photoshoot, Dorfman poses in traditionally glamorous film-star attire, including a sheer red dress.

The prospect of some of Australia’s and New Zealand’s best players switching allegiance to play for other nations if this year’s World Cup goes ahead is “highly likely” according to the chief executive of the Australian players’ union.
The Australian Rugby League Commission and New Zealand Rugby League are adamant they will not be sending squads to compete in the tournament in England later this year due to player welfare concerns regarding Covid-19, with World Cup organisers spending the weekend in dialogue with government officials trying to determine whether or not to proceed without them, or whether to postpone the event for 12 months.

“It cost me $10,000,” a friend of Karegeya’s remembers the businessman telling them. “It’s a model you can only buy in the Middle East, a phone you can’t be tracked on.” Karegeya picked it up, weighed it, and put it back down on the counter where it was charging. “You’ve been robbed,” the ex spy chief joked.

Like a mushroom – one of the appetizing yet poisonous species, perhaps – M Night Shyamalan thrives in dark, contained spaces. His latest film Old isn’t physically enclosed, the majority taking place on an idyllic tropical inlet with gorgeous vistas of sand, sky and surf, though its visitors will soon learn that this beckoning setting wants to kill them and isn’t so easily escaped. But narratively speaking, it’s a tighter and more focused movie than we’ve seen from the film-maker in some time, and not so coincidentally, it finds him in top form. Planting nearly a dozen characters in a fixed locale, plunging them into terror, and letting the tension mount plays to the strengths of an unpredictable artist who shines under minimal, Twilight Zone-style parameters. The corollary to this notion reveals the fatal flaw that’s dealt his reputation and career so many ups and downs over nearly 30 years of film-making: a tragic excess of ambition.

In the 30 years after the end of the second world war, many British cities embarked on the wholesale destruction of their history. Residential streets were out and tower blocks were in, and cars had always to be accommodated. The dense, extravagant, smoke-stained fabric of the Victorian city came down in clouds of dust. It was often calculated that the country had knowingly obliterated more of its historic buildings in the 1950s and 60s than the Luftwaffe’s bombs had managed in wartime. Behind it all, wrote the architectural historian Gavin Stamp, lay “a sense of shame about the industrial past, a visceral and blinkered rejection of the dark but substantial legacy of the Victorians – fuelled in part by a crude socialist vision – that could amount to little more than civic self-hatred”.

Households paying expensive standard tariffs for gas and electricity are to be automatically moved on to a cheaper deal as the government moves to tackle “rip off” bills.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said on Friday that an automatic switching system would be trialled in 2024. The scheme is intended to eliminate the “loyalty penalty” in which longstanding customers end up on the most expensive tariffs if they fail to act when their deal ends.

From the second you walk into Bournemouth’s O2 Academy, it’s clear that gigs are not as they once were. An hour before Wolf Alice are due to take the stage for their first full, non-socially distanced live show in nearly two years, the atmosphere already feels more like an evening’s sweaty climax. People are cheering everything, including the roadie who comes on stage to say “one-two-one-two” into the microphones and the music playing through the PA: each song is greeted by a bellow of enthusiasm and a mass singalong.
Under the circumstances, you get the feeling that Wolf Alice could come on stage and read out Stalin’s speech to the 1939 Soviet Communist party congress – in the original Russian – and still get a reaction like the Beatles got at Shea Stadium. Instead, they play a set heavy on songs from their new album: over half of Blue Weekend – nominated, like every album Wolf Alice have thus far released, for the Mercury prize – gets an airing.

Experts and charities have raised the alarm about rising youth violence in the UK and say it could erupt over the summer, aggravated by Covid lockdowns, mental health problems and months out of education. 
Overstretched youth services lack the funding and resources needed to tackle the problem and are bracing themselves for a surge in violence similar to that seen when lockdown was lifted last year, according to Kayleigh Wainwright, the director of collective action at the national charity UK Youth.

It has gone from harmless pastime to one of the most dangerous activities during Covid, but with restrictions in England now lifted, sitting in a small enclosed space with friends belting out favourite songs – otherwise known as karaoke – is taking off and people are returning in droves.
Lucky Voice, which has karaoke rooms in London and Brighton, said it was “jampacked” over the summer. “We’re really hoping to go from strength to strength over the summer, the pent-up demand that we were hoping for is definitely there,” said the managing director, Charlie Elek.

Often, the political week heading into the Commons summer recess can feel almost soporific, with the thoughts of ministers and MPs geared more towards holiday sunbeds than rows. But the last seven days has been different, and not only because of the ongoing political flux of coronavirus, with the government seeming to flail from one controversy, U-turn or misstep to the next, day after day.

Torrential rain has caused devastating floods in China, as well as India, Germany, Belgium and Austria. And while fires are raging in Siberia, Madagascar is experiencing the world’s first famine caused solely by the climate crisis. Even here in the UK, the first extreme heat warnings were issued earlier this week.
New extreme-weather events linked to the climate crisis have become rolling news. Their destruction and death tolls are a daily reminder that the UK-hosted Cop26 this autumn isn’t just the most important climate conference ever held, but the most important international summit of all time.

On the last day of term in parliament, there’s a bad tradition of governments sneaking out a host of unwelcome reports and decisions they hope to hide amid the great Westminster summer escape. Not this time. Instead, in a week of fiasco for the government, all we can hear is the ear-splitting clatter of huge cans being kicked down the road. Recess comes with everything Boris Johnson should have done left undone. The prime minister’s fatal indecision is final.
Newspaper front pages shout about shelves left unfilled by pinged workers, while a million pinged children in England miss their last week of school, and many sectors fear being overwhelmed by pings. This week’s promised list of crucial workers to be exempt from Covid test-and-trace isolation finally emerged last night, covering a number of industries including emergency services, local government, food and medical supplies. As every sector howled for help, yet another hapless minister – Kwasi Kwarteng on Thursday’s BBC Breakfast – was sent over the top to say nothing at all: yes there would be a list, only “quite narrow”, but no, it wasn’t ready right now. Why on earth did it take so long?

A fun game to play with the metropolitan elite, or indeed anyone south of Watford, is to ask them to locate Hexham on a map. Or Northumberland, for that matter. Many patches of the north, with the rural north-east being a particularly good example, feel like the Bermuda Triangle to southerners: mysterious, loosely defined and quite feasibly patrolled by monsters. To me, however, Hexham was subject of many a “nice drive out” from Carlisle in the 1980s, bumbling along B-roads towards this sedate market town with a grade I-listed abbey dating from AD674, several art galleries, plenty of places to eat stottie cake and a chance to learn about the Vindolanda fort on Hadrian’s Wall.
As a child, I did not appreciate Hexham’s beauty, and longed instead to be taken to the Gateshead MetroCentre to eat at Spud-U-Like and peruse Athena for sepia posters of hunks shifting tyres. But recently I returned and stayed at The Beaumont hotel and ate in its very fine restaurant. If I’m very honest, not a single local will thank me for alerting you to this chic, recently renovated, 33-room, townhouse-style hotel with a bar that will serve you a decent apricot bellini or a cold bottle of petit chablis to enjoy on tables close to the abbey’s grounds, because, until now, The Beaumont has been largely Hexham’s secret.
Perhaps I liked my Saturday night alone in Hexham so much because The Beaumont still retains an air of chipper, diligent, business-as-usual hospitality. It’s a mood that so many larger outfits have given up on right now, due to staff shortages, to can’t-be-arsedness and especially to irrational new post-Covid company policies that seem to be nothing more than budget-slashing masquerading as “keeping you safe”.

Some of these fires are now so intense and large they can create their own weather systems, including fire tornadoes, clouds and other weird phenomena – including smoky haze that has reached New York City, 3,000 miles from where the fires started. New York City now has some of the world’s worst air quality, prompting state officials to issue an alert for residents with underlying health conditions, such as asthma, to avoid the outdoors.

Vora says she is ‘interested in how we might unite and reflect on this time currently being experienced in our individual and collective ways, as we all live in the hope of clambering out and making it to the other side unscathed.

All this week Guardian journalists across the world have been reporting on a massive data leak: more than 50,000 phone numbers that, it is believed, have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of the spyware company NSO Group. 
The leak has made people realise that without us really noticing, the world changed. There are now 3.8bn smartphones globally. They hear our most intimate conversations, hold our deepest secrets – each one can be a microphone and a camera, waiting to be switched on.

Significant numbers of Europeans in the UK aged over 65 failed to apply to the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) before the deadline, a parliamentary report has found, warning that this could make thousands of retirement-aged EU nationals vulnerable to Britain’s hostile environment policies.
Just 2% of all applications for the settlement scheme were submitted by people aged over 65, a percentage that is unlikely to reflect the population of older EU nationals living in the UK. Charities supporting older Europeans to apply said they had “encountered many individuals who have no mobile phone, no digital access and inappropriate or no documentation”, and the report warned that people who struggled with the digital technology required to apply were more likely to have missed the deadline for applications at the end of last month.

Ministers are forcing the NHS to cover part of the cost of its 3% staff pay rise in a move which health service chiefs say could lead to cuts in patient care.
The NHS in England will have to find about £500m to help fund the 3% increase that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced on Wednesday, despite already struggling to meet the extra costs of the pandemic, including the care backlog, and treatment for the soaring numbers of people with “long Covid”.

The US has imposed sanctions on a Cuban security minister and an interior ministry special forces unit for alleged human rights abuses in a crackdown on anti-government protests this month.
The move marked the first concrete steps by Joe Biden’s administration to apply pressure on Cuba’s Communist government as it faces calls from US lawmakers and the Cuban American community to show greater support for the biggest protests to hit the island in decades.

Welcome to the world of private equity, also known as the “billionaire factory”, where already super-rich firms have used low interest rates and their considerable financial firepower to embark on a multi-billion dollar buying spree this year. 
Mere mortals were this week given a rare glimpse inside the money-spinning and highly secretive private equity industry – which buys up companies, often using more debt than stock market investors would tolerate, then floats or sells them on again – as the London firm Bridgepoint floated on the stock market.

As it is now, so it has always been. Eighteen months after the first modern Olympic Games, at Athens in 1896, the entire organising committee resigned en masse because they thought the job was impossible. The country was, in the phrase of the prime minister, Charilaos Trikoupis, “regretfully bankrupt”. He told the fledgling International Olympic Committee that the economic situation meant there was no way the Games could go ahead. The IOC’s founder, Pierre de Coubertin, heard but didn’t listen. Instead he got to work, wheedling, cajoling, politicking, pushing ahead regardless.

Boris Johnson has been accused of orchestrating a cover-up over the Greensill lobbying scandal after an official review issued a mild rebuke of former prime minister David Cameron while criticising a deceased senior civil servant.
The report drawn up by City solicitor Nigel Boardman also praised lobbying as part of a functioning democracy after admitting that the businessman Lex Greensill was given “extraordinarily privileged” access to Downing Street. However, Cameron and the late cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood were criticised in the 141-page review.

Parliament is breaking for the summer recess with the Conservatives in a shambles over some of the most fundamental issues facing the country. Government tactics for getting into the recess without allowing MPs a proper chance to examine big issues like Covid controls, social care reform, public sector pay and public spending have been reminiscent of football time-wasting ploys at their worst. The absences from the frontline of the prime minister, the chancellor and the health secretary, all self-isolating, are simply irritants of the larger problem, not the cause.
The issue is that ministers do not know what to do. The reason is that all these issues are connected. For days, there was Westminster talk of a strategic pre-recess announcement on social care reform. Decisions on NHS and other public sector pay rates were much trailed too. In the event, there has been no social care statement – while a set of pay decisions was shuffled out at the last minute in a ministerial written statement. Government evasions, delays and disagreements have cloaked every turn and every issue – and still do. The explanation is simple and glum: the government cannot make up its mind because it knows much of what it has to say will be unpopular.

Last year saw the highest global military spending – nearly $2tn – since 1988. More than half of that was expenditure by the United States and its allies. Defence capabilities are closely guarded national assets. A web of rules has grown up around the export of arms and their use. No country wants its most lethal weapons being turned upon themselves. 
Yet there are at least 500 private companies that operate, largely unregulated, and sell intrusive software to oppressive regimes that spy on and harass their critics. These anti-democratic acts ought to be enough to bring such trade to a halt. However it has continued; the industry says these tools are for fighting crime and terrorism. What happens when, instead, governments opt to use these capabilities not just on their people, but on the democratic west?

On Saturday, when the cycling opens in Tokyo, the 2018 Tour de France winner has what will probably be his last chance to lay the ghost.
“I don’t lose sleep about it now, but it was there for the taking, it was a great opportunity,” Thomas recalled on Thursday. He ended up 11th, with Belgium’s Greg Van Avermaet winning gold. “As [the former Team GB psychiatrist] Steve Peters kept telling me, life is unfair, you don’t get what you deserve. It was super frustrating and I’d like to put it right on Saturday.”

One was Merkel the politician, unafraid to talk up her achievements, who patted herself on the back for diplomatic victories and expertly fudged answers to difficult questions. The other was Merkel the scientist, who found it hard to skirt around uncomfortable truths and instinctively wanted to scrutinise her doppelgänger’s track record.

The government’s consideration of a rise in national insurance presents an ideal opportunity to question the unfairness of the current 12% and 2% NI rate levels (Ministers mull national insurance rise to fund social care, 19 July). Employee NI contributions (NICs) are no different to income tax. We know this because HMRC’s annual tax summaries, as sent to every taxpayer in the land, combine income tax and NICs in calculating how our taxes have contributed to the full range of government spending.
The specific text reads: “The information on this page shows how your income tax and national insurance contributions were spent … The list does not include indirect taxes such as VAT and other duties.” It then lists how much each of us has individually paid towards the full range of government expenditure on welfare, education, defence, etc.

Let me get this right: lockdown was damaging the economy through the restrictions imposed on trade and commerce. So “freedom” is declared. But the accompanying upsurge of the Johnson variant and increase in infections, and ensuing “pingdemic”, brings the economy to its knees (Supermarkets struggle to stock shelves as ‘pingdemic’ havoc spreads, 21 July). Something wrong there, surely?

• I always greatly enjoy reading Aditya Chakrabortty and I was delighted to discover a new phrase: “coprophagic cynicism” (After Covid, the climate crisis will be the next thing the right says we ‘just have to live with’, 22 July). I intend to use it in conversation as soon as possible and I do not expect to wait long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a cast worthy of Agatha Christie, this tale of a resort where time has been terrifyingly accelerated is brilliantly poised between serious and silly
M Night Shyamalan is enjoying some serious mojo-recovery with his best film since The Sixth Sense: a woozy high-concept horror about being trapped on an apparently idyllic private beach, where time is fatally accelerated. Anyone who dislikes overheated beach holidays will probably already know the feeling of supernaturally rapid ageing, horror and face-shrivelling panic. And in fact these are the feelings I’ve often had watching some of Shyamalan’s recent films.
This is different. Old is an enthrallingly bizarre piece of old-fashioned entertainment: adapted by Shyamalan from the graphic novel Sandcastle, by Pierre Oscar Lévy and Frederik Peeters; it is exactly suited to Shyamalan’s talent for a particular kind of audacious, ingenious hokum. But unlike his mysteries The Village or The Happening, where Shyamalan appeared to lose his grip on the steering wheel halfway through (or earlier), the enjoyably preposterous yet creepy premise is maintained to the finish line. Old is a bit like Alex Garland’s The Beach, but with a dab of Twilight Zone creepiness and an ensemble cast that Agatha Christie might have imagined. Most of all, I found myself thinking that this could have come from the original series of Star Trek – and that at any moment, William Shatner might beam down among the panicky, deteriorating beach-dwellers, phaser at the ready. Sadly for them, however, these existentially stricken vacationers are on their own.

What does the new age of surveillance mean for the work of investigative journalists? Last year, I was preparing to fly from London to a country in the Middle East for a sensitive reporting trip. I wasn’t worried about my own safety – but now I have to take extraordinary measures to protect the security of my data.
Bringing my own laptop or personal phone was out of the question. Instead I bought a completely new phone. I made sure not to sign into any of my accounts from the phone, and I did not save any numbers in the blank address book. Before I left, I created a temporary email address specifically for this trip, where sources could reach me.

Angela Merkel has conceded Germany’s record on reducing carbon emissions was “not sufficient” to meet the global warming targets of the Paris climate agreement, as the chancellor reflected on the achievements and missed opportunities of her 16-year leadership.
Speaking at the last of her annual summer press conferences on Thursday before stepping down as leader of Europe’s largest economy after federal elections on 26 September, Merkel said Germany “has done a lot” to recalibrate its economy in the face of the climate crisis, increasing the share of renewables in its energy mix from 10% to 40%, and lowering carbon emission by 20% in the period from 1990 to 2010, and by another 20% in the 10 years since.

The prospect of a government legislating to impose an independent regulator on England’s most popular and successful sport has moved closer than ever after it was recommended by Tracey Crouch, chair of the government’s “fan-led review” into the game’s governance difficulties.
A former Conservative sports minister, Crouch made the recommendation in a letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, setting out preliminary findings after taking evidence from many supporter groups, the leagues, many clubs and others including German supporter groups. She committed to her “expert panel” doing further work before producing more recommendations on some of football’s structural challenges, most prominently the huge financial divide between the Premier League and the rest.

Are we living in a “nanny state”? Many apoplectic rightwingers think so: the Spectator laments the metamorphosis of “nanny Boris”, while the Daily Mail reported “fury” at “nanny-state meddling” after Henry Dimbleby’s National Food Strategy recommended a sugar tax. But what is so terrifying about nannies?
Since the late 18th century, “nanny” has been the word for someone (usually a woman) engaged by parents to look after their children. (“Nanny” was a common pet name for people called Anne or Agnes.) The term “nanny state”, a childish complaint that one is being treated like a child, is usually attributed to the Conservative MP Iain Macleod in 1965: it became popular with Tories in the 1980s as an alternative to “welfare state”, since welfare sounds too much like a good thing.

The key to understanding our basic biological machinery is its architecture. The chains of amino acids that comprise proteins twist and turn to make the most confounding of 3D shapes.

The Crown Prosecution Service must be held to account for its continued “betrayal” of rape victims, the victims’ commissioner of England and Wales has said, as new figures revealed rape prosecutions had fallen to another record low.
Dame Vera Baird said the CPS’s “woeful” performance was at “the root of the problem”, after the organisation’s annual figures showed that the number of cases that reach court dropped by more than a quarter in 2020-21. There were 1,557 prosecutions in England and Wales in 2020-21, down 25.9% from 2,102 prosecutions in 2019-20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new documentary surveys the mess of Woodstock 1999 – a disaster of poor planning and a microcosm of toxic masculinity, raunch culture and entitlement
It would be easy, as the director Garrett Price says in the opening seconds of his documentary Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage, to structure a film about the disastrous music festival held on a July weekend in 1999 as a comedy. The reboot of Woodstock for an audience mostly born after the original festival in 1969 was a proto-Fyre meltdown of grotesque American excess, a panoply of late 90s nonsense – Kid Rock strolling on stage in a white fur coat, Limp Bizkit as a main draw, mostly young, white, male Gen-Xers paying to see nu metal acts in a poorly managed swamp of filth. But the easy jabs, the sheen of cultural nostalgia over any Woodstock, particularly the first one, mask what actually, says Price, “played out much more like a horror film”.
Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage captures an event that devolved spectacularly, with a palpable current of misogyny, white male rage, entitlement and cynical commercialism. The facilities built at an old air force base in Rome, New York – the irony of a new Woodstock held at a military facility – collapsed under the weight of 200,000 visitors. With water sold at $4, many festival-goers went without in temperatures over 100F (37.8C). Over 1,200 were treated for medical conditions; three people died. It’s a miracle it wasn’t more – the festival ended in riots, as attendees whipped up by three days of anarchy-fueled music burned the fairgrounds. Forty-four were arrested. There were 10 reported sexual assaults, but a cursory glance at the footage – male attendees groping topless women with glee, as if free love equates to free violation – assures there were many more.

Members of the public will soon be able to join the debate as the National Gallery on Thursday announced it was buying the work in question for the nation: Thomas Lawrence’s portrait of Charles William Lambton (1818-31), popularly known as the “Red Boy”.

The aviation industry must pay for costly carbon removal technologies rather than rely on using the planting of trees to claim they are reducing emissions, the head of the Climate Change Committee has said.
Chris Stark said aviation, unlike other transport sectors, was unlikely to meet targets for net zero by 2050. He said instead the industry had to use “scaleable” offsets that matched ongoing emissions into future decades, but that these should be used as a last resort after directly cutting emissions.

If you say so, Jeff. But it looked very much like the intergalactic equivalent of one of those cruises where a vast herd is disgorged ashore for a brief, bewildered trample over the nearest landmark before being rounded up and whisked away to the next port.

Arsenal plan third offer for goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale

Arsenal have tied down Emile Smith Rowe to a new five-year contract in a major pre-season boost for Mikel Arteta’s side. Smith Rowe, who burst on to the first-team scene last season and became one of the top performers for a largely inconsistent side, has also been given the No 10 shirt in a further show of confidence in the 20-year-old attacking midfielder’s ability.
Other clubs had been alerted to Smith Rowe’s potential availability while negotiations with Arsenal continued, and Aston Villa had bids of about £25m and £30m firmly rejected last month. Now they will stand no chance of getting their man and Smith Rowe, an academy product who has been with Arsenal since the age of 10, will be integral to his club’s attempt at a revival in 2021-22.

After extraordinary revelations that the Israeli company NSO Group’s mercenary cyber-surveillance tool, Pegasus, was allegedly used to target political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists and politicians around the world, Israel should be asking itself a few questions. Does its groundbreaking hi-tech industry have a dark side? Do the actors involved in exporting lucrative surveillance products – including the defence ministry, which must approve such sales, or perhaps the top levels of the previous government – bear responsibility?
While top Israeli officials are taking the revelations seriously, Israelis appear neither shamed nor shaken. The day after the NSO story broke, there was an announcement from another company that would eclipse talk of the rogue use of surveillance spyware. Ben & Jerry’s announced that it would cease the sale of its products in the “occupied Palestinian territories”. By midweek one had to squint to find NSO in the Israeli media, as the ice cream incident was dominating headlines. Persecution of human rights defenders, sabotaging freedom of the press, surveillance of political opposition and possible links to grisly murder all took second place, while a non-violent political protest by a single private company, set to begin a year and a half from now (when Ben and Jerry’s licensing deal runs out), overshadowed everything.

Non-native lionfish have become increasingly common in parts of the Mediterranean in recent years, threatening local ecosystems and posing a hazard to humans through their venomous spines.
Marine biologist Prof Jason Hall-Spencer first saw a lionfish off the coast of Cyprus in 2016. It was just an individual, but the species – which produce about 2 million eggs each year and lack natural predators in their new environment – have quickly become prevalent. “In some places, I’ve seen 40 on one dive,” said Hall-Spencer, from the University of Plymouth.

The accusation that someone is “playing politics” has become a regular slur among my political opponents. Most recently, Natalie Elphicke, who succeeded her husband as MP for Dover while he was under suspicion of sexual offences, accused Marcus Rashford of “playing politics”, suggesting that his desire to speak up about hungry schoolchildren had harmed his football skills and taken his eye off the ball. 
The suggestion here is, of course, that politics is solely the pursuit of politicians and that when other people get involved, they are merely acting out a childish game. In fact, Rashford plays politics considerably better than Elphicke, because unlike her, he has led campaigns that galvanised a million people and changed government policy, and has a direct line to the prime minister. I’ll wager he is also better at kicking a ball. Two nil to Rashford.

This rousing Gin Lane musical by April De Angelis and Lucy Rivers has working-class women at its heart
Gin Craze! enacts a lesser-remembered piece of 18th-century social history in which the culture wars between the governing elite and the working classes were fought out through the consumption of gin. Long before Gordon’s rendered it a refined drink, working women worshipped gin for its apparently divine properties. This earthy, raucous and heartwarming musical centres on the women of Gin Lane – selling “genever” and intent on defying the prohibitive Gin Act of 1751 to assert their economic freedoms.
The main focus is on gin-sellers Mary (Aruhan Galieva) and Lydia (Paksie Vernon), the latter dressed as “Jack” to give them greater legitimacy, but their wider posse includes drunks and sex workers, with every actor shining in their part and each character made grittily lovable. Their story is woven in with the real-life figure of Henry Fielding (Alex Mugnaioni), the novelist and magistrate who, with his half-brother John Fielding (Peter Pearson), founded the Bow Street Runners. Their sister Sarah (Rachel Winters) also features as a buttoned-up do-gooder with a lesbian past while Queen Caroline (the German wife to George II played by Debbie Chazen) turns up in satirical interludes to speak in a fantastic English and German mashup and spout hypocrisies on the dangers of drink.

After all its emotional strife, the Back to Black album concludes with a jokey paean to weed. You could construct an argument that Addicted is Winehouse once more tapping into a venerable jazz tradition – it’s easy to imagine Fats Waller singing about someone snaffling his stash in the 30s – but perhaps it’s better to just enjoy its mordant wit.

After 18 months of lying low, Phyllida Barlow is at large again. The artist’s hangar-like studio on a south London industrial estate is a yawning void, while on the other side of city, and across the sea in Germany, and thousands of miles away in Japan, the works she conceived and constructed in it are looming into a monumental new life.
Under plastic, dwarfed by the empty space, is a model of the piece she has contributed to a group exhibition of 16 female artists aged 70 or older, at Tokyo’s Mori Art Museum. At 77, Barlow is a mere stripling in a show whose oldest contributor is 105. She pulls back the sheeting to reveal a riot of wood, plaster and fabric, in gloriously clashing oranges and pinks. But its thrown-together appearance is an illusion; as she talks, she primps the ruched cotton like a couturier preparing a bride to walk down the aisle.

China’s nearest observation posts are hundreds of miles from Dharamsala, the city in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas that hosts Tibet’s government-in-exile and its highest spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Still, Tibetans there have often felt closely watched.
Suspected Chinese spies have regularly been detected in the hill station. A decade ago, a digital security specialist watched in disbelief as sensitive files on Tibetan government computers were extracted on the screen before his eyes – activity that led to the unearthing of a massive cyber-espionage network, known as GhostNet, which was largely traced to Chinese servers.

After just one week of living in New York, the city locked down, and a summer of love seemed unlikely. I did go on a series of virtual dates, with around 20 guys over four months; some were funny, kind and smart, and some were a little weird. One or two of them became my friends. Then, I finally got a call from Mr Right on the long weekend of 4 July. We started talking and he was everything I’d hoped for – except he was in Michigan, hundreds of miles away. In early August, he casually mentioned he’d be coming to NYC to meet me, and the next day he drove for 10 hours to take me for dinner.

Noise-cancelling headphones are my most cherished luggage. On busy trains, planes and ferries they block out the thrum of engines, the cries of babies and the sounds leaking from other people’s headsets. They allow me to be entertained by music, podcasts or audiobooks when turbulence, bumpy tracks or heavy swell make reading impossible. Most importantly, they make food taste better! Taste is affected by hearing, and the background engine drone is one reason aeroplane food tastes so bland. I pop on my headphones and, if not haute cuisine, the food does develop taste.

Any visitor to the island of Utøya, some 38 kilometres from Oslo, is immediately struck by the smallness of it. It measures no more than 26 acres. It was here that, 10 years ago this month, Anders Behring Breivik massacred 69 people attending a Norwegian Labour party youth camp. As one walks along the island’s tiny, winding paths, it is not difficult to imagine the sheer horror of it all, as teenagers, full of life, joy and laughter, suddenly realised that the shots being fired in the distance were not firecrackers, that the visitor dressed in a fake police uniform was a murderer, and that the island had all too few places in which to hide.
As Norway approaches the 10-year anniversary, and as far-right and anti-Muslim violence remains a feature of our political culture across the world, it is worth looking back at the lessons learned and those missed from this dark chapter in my country’s history.

Eleven years ago, when I was just a little girl with a big dream, I had to call myself Colin and pretend to be a boy so that I could step inside a boxing ring. I was nine and girls were not allowed to box at the famous Repton Boys Club in east London. All these years later I am so happy that the girl who called herself Colin, and tried to disguise her real identity, has arrived in Tokyo to fight for Team GB in the Olympic Games. It’s been quite a journey.
My big brother Daniel boxed at the Repton and I copied everything he did. I fell in love with boxing and I convinced our dad he should also take me to the gym. He understood because boxing runs in our blood. One of our ancestors, Sylvia Dubois, was an African-American slave who won her freedom as a bare-knuckle fighter in the 18th century.

It is Tuesday afternoon and four hours before kick-off Sutton United’s kit man, Clive Baxter, is in his van just off White Hart Lane waiting for the gates to be unlocked at Haringey Borough’s stadium. The 70-year-old has volunteered at the club for the past 60 years, taking in more than 3,000 games, and his zest for all things Sutton embodies everything about a modest club still pinching themselves as they prepare to take their first steps in the Football League.
Unsurprisingly, it was Baxter for whom the players and staff made a beeline after securing promotion against Hartlepool, who went on to reach League Two via the play-offs. Since gleefully taking the role of tea boy in 1961, at a time when both sets of players and officials would head into the clubhouse after a game to sit side by side for a three-course meal, Baxter has missed only five Sutton games, the last 10 years ago, a pre-season friendly against Eastleigh that clashed with his daughter’s wedding.

There was a whiff of manufactured outrage about Amazon’s recent renewal of Jeremy Clarkson’s cleverly named farming show Clarkson’s Farm. At the start of the month, Clarkson tweeted: “There has been some speculation that a second series of our farming programme has been commissioned. It hasn’t but we are hopeful.” This quickly led to rumours that it had been axed.
A week and a bit later, further itchiness had set in. When asked if series two was filming, he replied: “We aren’t. Write to Amazon, it’s their decision.” Then this week, shortly after Jeff Bezos had ridden his rocket-powered overcompensation to the edge of space, desperation set in. “Well done @JeffBezos, really well done,” he tweeted, before adding: “Can I do my farming show now?”

If Emma Pickett needs to make a long journey, she checks her calendar very carefully. She will often take an emergency change of clothes when she goes out, and if giving a lecture for work, has to ensure it is no longer than half an hour. Yet she rarely hears anyone talk about the reason so many older women secretly go to all this trouble; why they’ve started to stick to black trousers, give up the sports they loved, or plan days out – especially with children – meticulously.
“If you have a bunch of 12-year-olds in the car, you can’t say: ‘Sorry chaps, I’m just bleeding heavily today,’” says Pickett, a 48-year-old breastfeeding counsellor and author of The Breast Book, who also happens to be among the one in five British women who suffer from heavy periods in the run-up to menopause (or perimenopause). “You can talk about hot flushes, make a joke about it. But because menstrual blood is gross in our society, there’s no conversation about it. There must be women round the world just pretending they need to dash off for some other reason.”

William Hanage is a Harvard epidemiology professor

England ended all pandemic restrictions on Monday. Nightclubs reopened, along with other large events and gatherings – with masks, testing and other mitigation measures “encouraged” (which is another way of saying “optional”). This is against a background of skyrocketing case rates due to the Delta variant.
In January, at the height of the second wave, the daily total hit 60,000 cases, but at the current rate of increase that will be eclipsed within days – even in the absence of all the renewed super-spreading opportunities that the virus will now enjoy. Thanks to the Covid-curious policies of the past few months, the UK is already in the grip of an uncontrolled epidemic among unvaccinated people, with significant numbers of breakthrough infections among the vaccinated. And both are about to get worse.

Rocksalt was one of the key restaurants that helped shape Folkestone’s current food scene when it opened in 2011, transforming the harbour into a dining destination. Its success has spawned several sister venues in town, including the new Pilot bar on the beach, and its neighbour Little Rock, which opened this month – the group’s “funky younger sister”, said the waitress. With palm trees, sun sails (surprisingly effective at a scorching lunchtime) and gleaming white terrace boasting ocean views, it’s more Ibiza than Kent coast. Fish specials – including huss, Dover sole and ray – come from day boats operating out of Folkestone Harbour. Citrus-cured gilt-head bream with spring onions and chilli proved a suitably sunny starter to accompany chilled vinho verde, while pale ale battered cod cheeks, their flesh opaque, came pimped up by a tangy tartare sauce studded with capers. Azure glassware and a gently throbbing soundtrack boost the holiday vibes.

The recent heatwave that broiled the US Pacific north-west not only obliterated temperature records in cities such as Seattle and Portland – it also put a torch to a comforting bromide that the region would be a mild, safe haven from the ravages of the climate crisis.
Unprecedented temperatures baked the region three weeks ago, part of a procession of heatwaves that have hit the parched US west, from Montana to southern California, over the past month. A “heat dome” that settled over the area saw Seattle reach 108F (42.2C), smashing the previous record by 3F (1.7C), while Portland, Oregon, soared to its own record of 116F (46.7C). Some inland areas managed to get up to 118F (47.8C).

The Covid-19 pandemic has plunged theatres into a crisis of closures and cancellations that harks back to Shakespeare’s day. When London’s playhouses were forced to shut more than 400 years ago during the bubonic plague, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men – the company of actors for whom Shakespeare wrote – left the capital to tour the provinces. Macbeth was probably written during the 1606 epidemic and carries its own plague imagery.

Larry was a house cat when we took him in, but my boyfriend and I had recently moved to a house with a garden so had started letting him out. Just like that, our adorable, loving, docile cat turned into the neighbourhood bruiser. He stopped snuggling with us in the morning, instead impatiently pawing at the door even before we had put down his breakfast.

Drowsy, confused and not quite believing what he had just been told, McIntyre fell back asleep. He awoke the following morning thinking, “What did she tell me?” McIntyre looked online, and saw that it was true: their good friend, the 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee, had been observing a riot in Derry the previous night when she was shot by a republican gunman.

Musk sent the price of bitcoin into freefall in May when he said that Tesla would stop accepting the cryptocurrency for payment because it the so-called mining of the coins used too much fossil fuel-generated electricity.

But the move triggered McCarthy to pull all five of the Republicans he had chosen off the committee if Pelosi wouldn’t seat the whole cohort – and threaten to set up their own investigation into the 6 January Capitol attack.

The report, based on a four-month inquiry by the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport, calls for “urgent action by the government to address a long-term failure to reduce the risk of brain injuries in sport”. It is strongly critical of both the Football Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association for “failing to fight hard enough or publicly enough to address the issue of concussion” and recommends an urgent overhaul of concussion management across all grassroots and elite sport in the UK.

The actor brings brilliant nuance and daring to his part in an age-blind production marred by some eccentric decisions
This Hamlet, starring 82-year-old Ian McKellen as the quixotic prince, has endured high-profile setbacks including the departure of two key actors during the preview period. It officially opened, at its delayed press night, to the thrill of a full-capacity audience yet is something of a bumpy production despite its star lead and the inspired central innovation to be play it age-blind.
Director Sean Mathias presents a host of interesting ideas yet many fail to take flight. Elsinore is located in a recognisably modern world but lacks a more specific socio-political framework. Pacing is choppy, with scenes passing either too quickly or too slowly. Most criminally, the rich relationships are flattened, from Claudius’s insecurity and need for Gertrude to Hamlet’s complicated passion for Ophelia, and so is the exploration of love between siblings and children’s loyalty to their fathers. Characters appear simplified and undercharged, especially in the play’s female roles – always a challenge to make rounded and real.

Emma Lamb probably spoke for all of us. She, along with fellow batter Lizelle Lee, had walked out to open for Manchester Originals, and had clearly not expected the Olympics-worthy eruption of fireworks around the Oval. The camera caught her staring open-mouthed at the pink, green and white explosions, and stayed on her as her lips formed the syllables: “What ... the ... sh ...?” The commentators did not offer a translation: this was family entertainment, after all.

Dane van Niekerk hits 56 as hosts chase down 136 in 98 balls

On a soupy midsummer evening in south London the Hundred was finally born, a troubled three-year gestation period making way for a positive explosion of sound and light as Oval Invincibles felled Manchester Originals in an electric start to proceedings.
English cricket looked to make a statement by launching its controversial new offering with a women’s game. To the delight of over 7,000 spectators in the Oval who lapped up the entertainment – and doubtless the relief of the under-fire organisers – the international stars on show very much met the brief.

Smoke from wildfires – particularly those that burn manmade structures – can significantly increase the amount of hazardous toxic metals present in the air, sending up plumes that can travel for miles, a new study from the California Air Resources Board (Carb) has suggested.
The study compared air monitor readings from numerous California fires, such as the devastating Camp fire that decimated the California town of Paradise in 2018 and killed 85 people.

Rather, the act of listing the firm on the stock exchange crystallised the value of shares they already owned and allowed them to flog a few.
But, however you view the numbers in this £2.88bn flotation, or IPO, they illustrate how private equity is challenging investment banking for the status of best-paid gig in the financial game.

The sector had been bracing itself for a pay freeze after the chancellor warned in last November’s spending review that public sector pay rises would have to be paused in 2021-22 for all but NHS staff.

For Hanibal Tekle, the news that Robel Teklemichael had become only the second Eritrean footballer to cross the border and sign a professional deal with a club in Ethiopia since war broke out between the countries in 1998 provoked mixed emotions. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Tekle reflects.
But when Teklemichael – the 21-year-old defender who captained Eritrea to second place in the 2019 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup, a tournament for teams from East Africa – followed in the footsteps of his compatriot Samyoma Alexander by joining the Addis Ababa side Ethiopia Bunna in April, Tekle was left to wonder what might have been in terms of his own career. He was one of four players who fled after Eritrea’s 5-0 win over Zanzibar in the quarter-finals of the Under-20 Cecafa Cup in Uganda nearly two years ago and remain in hiding as they await the result of their asylum application. Tekle knows he could easily have been playing as a professional alongside Teklemichael.

“Is it stupidly ridiculous for me to win an Olympic medal?” asks Keely Hodgkinson, smiling as she allows the question to marinate. “I don’t think so.” And then, with a fearlessness that has become her trademark, Britain’s brightest teenage track star explains why. “I’ve proven myself this year. When I go into a race I want to win regardless of who’s in it. And anything can happen in championship racing.”
Hodgkinson knows it will be tough to emulate Kelly Holmes, the last middle distance athlete to win an 800m Olympic medal for Britain in 2004. Then again, it has been a staggering year already. She started in 2021 not even on lottery funding. But in March, just four days after she turned 19, she produced a performance of poise and power to become the youngest British winner of a European indoor title for more than 50 years. It was so impressive that Christian Malcolm, the head coach of UK Athletics, immediately tipped her to be at the vanguard of a new wave of British track and field stars.

The European Commission immediately ruled out a renegotiation of the deal, which was trumpeted by Boris Johnson as a solution to the Irish border impasse two years ago. The commission is understood to be open to some changes on the special arrangements for Northern Ireland, however.

Boris Johnson’s proposal to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol he signed in 2019 suggests that he has still not come to terms with the implications of his red lines on Brexit. Mr Johnson’s delusions on the issue run deep. In October 2019, the prime minister repeatedly told MPs that “there will be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland” despite his own government’s impact assessment saying precisely the opposite. These hurdles, Mr Johnson knew full well, would not be insignificant, as shoppers in Northern Ireland are now finding out. They are the predictable consequences of customs and regulatory deviations between the UK and the EU. Divergence required a border somewhere; the extra bureaucracy was baked into the protocol.
Mr Johnson needed a deal for political reasons ahead of the 2019 general election. He now wants to dump it because it’s bad for Britain. This has much to do with his government’s own behaviour, which has often been lazy, surly and chaotic. What has kept the show on the road has been grace periods, accepted by the EU, where rules of the deal are not applied. These are coming to an end. Without a breakthrough after months of talks behind closed doors, Mr Johnson has decided to conduct negotiations with Brussels in public.

In our polarised politics, here is at least something on which everyone agrees: the UK’s laws on paid sick leave are rubbish. Statutory sick pay is far too low, as the previous health secretary, Matt Hancock, admitted on television. At £95.85 a week, it is the meanest regime during this pandemic almost anywhere in the industrialised world – lower as a proportion of the average worker’s income than in Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia or any other OECD developed countries.
What’s more, nearly 2 million workers earn too little to claim it. At £120 a week or below, their income is judged too small to qualify. Should they develop a cough and a fever, they have a choice. They can follow medical advice, take time off work and live on thin air. Or they can struggle on, earn a wage – and pass on their virus to others.

The official film of the ’64 Olympics opens with a match cut; it jumps from the blazing white sun to a wrecking ball demolishing a bomb-ruined block of Tokyo city. Walls fall, dust rises. The ’64 Olympics cost $2.8bn, which made them the most expensive in history. They came on a wave of poured concrete, 100km of new super highways, a new sewage system, two new subway lines, a new monorail to the refurbished airport, a new Shinkansen line to Osaka. The Games were, sports historian David Goldblatt wrote, “both an instrument and symbol” of Japan’s rapid economic development and its post-war rehabilitation.

The chair of NatWest, one of Britain’s biggest banks, has said office life in London is unlikely ever to return to how things were before the coronavirus pandemic.
Howard Davies said he expected lasting cultural changes even after the danger from the virus receded. “The days when 2,500 people walked in through our office door on Bishopsgate at 8:30 and then walked out again at 6 o’clock, I think that is gone. I suspect there won’t be that many people who will be doing five long days in the office.”

The Schools minister, Nick Gibb, has pushed back against calls to decolonise the curriculum in England and has warned that what pupils learn in the classroom should not be tailored to any one particular group.
Amid mounting pressure to make the teaching of black history mandatory in schools and to diversify the national curriculum, the minister said there was no reason why children from ethnic minorities should not study the work of dead white men.

The threat has loomed over Liverpool for almost a decade. With every new building, crane and construction site that appeared on its historic waterfront, there was a growing inevitability that the city would be stripped of its prized world heritage status.
Many believe the final nail in the coffin was the approval of Everton FC’s new £500m stadium at Bramley Moore-Dock. The 53,000-capacity venue will be built on derelict land that has been cut off from the city for 60 years, hemmed in by some of Britain’s most deprived streets.

Patrick Lenton’s new book, Sexy Tales of Paleontology, is out now

Because of my job and my personality and my high school trauma (I was too hot to be likable), I am forced to be in a constant state of high alert on the internet. Every day for me is like we’re evacuating the president, klaxons ringing, red lights flashing, long-legged women in power suits handing me thick binders – except instead of moving an old important man to a bunker, we’re just finding memes on the internet to compile and send to our filthy little readers.
The sheer input of new information I have been forced to guzzle down every day like a thirsty orphan lamb is upsetting, like a never-ending game of bob-for-apples, with the water being the internet, apples being things happening online, and the strong forearms holding my head under the water being the insatiable demand for content from the digital media industry. It’s made me both deranged and incredibly jaded, where I’ll be able to watch the latest viral comedy video without feeling a flicker of emotion, then claim I “am screaming” about it. I am not screaming – I am simply enduring.

Is it normal to feel depressed after having the vaccine? I feel exactly as I did after doing my university exams. After I had finished months of revision, late nights and living off coffee and adrenaline, as soon as they were over I became a bit of a Debbie Downer. I felt tired, depressed and deflated for weeks afterwards, and I feel like that now. Is it me? Do I have PTSD?
Eleanor says: In my family lore we talk of a thing called deadline fever. It’s the invoice your body hands you after somehow finding the energy to hurl you across a finish line – the fatigue in your joints and muscles the nanosecond you complete what you needed to do.

What just happened? After a year of caution, life was opening up. I’ve eaten in a restaurant – beautifully clean and with spaced-out tables. I’ve stayed in a hotel – with a one-way system, mask-wearing staff and table service. I was even planning to take a train to see my daughter and the grandchildren after a year of staying away.
Then freedom day arrived and it feels like back to lockdown. Do I now feel like taking a train? No. Do I want to stay in a hotel or visit a restaurant? No. Back to life as we knew it means back to queuing at a bar, clearing used cups and trays to find a clean table, and sitting in crowded trains or buses with coughing passengers. For a short while we had freedom to unlock, but on Monday it disappeared. Oh, the irony.

Dominic Cummings’ latest utterances should not be treated as revelations, but rather as corroborating evidence of what should, in a functioning democracy, be treated as Britain’s gravest peacetime scandal. A prime minister sent tens of thousands of his own citizens to premature graves because he valued other considerations more highly than human life.
We knew Boris Johnson resisted demands from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies for a national lockdown in September, even if Johnson’s former senior adviser now fleshes out the prime minister’s reasonings: that most of those dying were in their 80s, whose disproportionate political loyalty to the Conservative party was rewarded by its leader caring not whether they lived or died. It was already clear that Johnson’s administration wanted Covid to “wash through the country”, because they briefed favoured journalists that “herd immunity” was their official strategy more than 17 months ago. Britain has a more severe death rate per million inhabitants than the United States in part because Johnson – alongside Rishi Sunak, whose reputation Cummings has sought to whitewash – wanted to prioritise the economy over life, and ended up devastating both.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has ordered multiple investigations to be carried out after his phone number, as well as those of his former prime minister and the majority of his 20-strong cabinet, appeared in the leaked database at the heart of the Pegasus project.
The French prime minister, Jean Castex, said on Wednesday the Elysée had “ordered a series of investigations”, after vowing to “shed all light on the revelations”.

“We are currently still searching for missed ones as we are clearing debris or pumping out cellars,” said Sabine Lackner of the federal agency for technical relief, a volunteering organisation belonging to the German ministry of the interior.

Chronic underfunding of the criminal justice system has left victims facing a “bleak” picture, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales has warned.
Dame Vera Baird said radical action was needed to improve the justice system, with a lack of support for victims of crime and long delays leaving many victims – particularly rape victims – lacking the confidence that they would receive justice.

Unesco strips Liverpool of its world heritage status

“A certificate on the wall” is how Liverpool’s former mayor Joe Anderson used to describe the city’s Unesco world heritage status. The unbridled contempt he showed for his own city’s architectural heritage has now come to its logical conclusion: the certificate has ended up in the bin, along with the reputation of this once great maritime metropolis.
Unesco’s decision to strip Liverpool of its hallowed heritage status is hardly surprising – nor will it probably affect the buoyant city a great deal. Much of the public reaction so far has been a defiant shrug. But the real shock is that it took the international watchdog quite so long to act.

Forty years ago, following the most intense and widespread urban disorder in 20th century Britain, the Times journalist Lucy Hodges and I co-wrote a book on the riots of 1981. In honour of Bob Marley, who died that spring, but also to try to convey the immensity of the events, we named the book after Marley’s final studio album: Uprising.
This week, in the wake of his 2020 series Small Axe, Steve McQueen has launched three documentaries with James Rogan covering the New Cross fire and the Brixton riots of 1981. They are broadcast on BBC1 this week. The title of the series is the same as our book, and surely for the exact same reasons: Uprising.

Anthony Bourdain was a singularly beloved cultural figure.

Given the intense connection to the chef turned TV personality felt by his fans, and the shock of his death, Roadrunner: A Film about Anthony Bourdain, a bracing, graceful new documentary on Bourdain that features his inner circle, was going to be met sensitively.

Perhaps you were friends with your partner for years before feelings became more amorous, but found the friendship-first approach to be key to building a lasting relationship? Maybe you discovered that turning your friendship into a love affair also had an impact on the dynamics of your wider social circle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[National Gallery, London
Bernardo Bellotto, the nephew and pupil of Canaletto, channelled his master’s Venetian magic into these five sublime views of a fortress in deepest Germany
We like to identify great upheavals in the arts with new centuries. So Romanticism began on 1 January 1800? Well, Turner and Beethoven were well into their stride by then. And modernism came along on the same date in 1900? Hmm, that makes it hard to account for Van Gogh, Munch and Cézanne. The National Gallery’s small but seismic summer exhibition exposes how shallow this thinking is. It does so by bringing together five scenes by a forgotten 18th-century artist, Bernardo Bellotto, whose depictions of deepest Germany, painted in 1756-58, are the first true stirrings of Romantic storminess.
A name inscribed on the frame of one of the paintings reveals why Bellotto has been so neglected: it calls him Il Canalettino, Little Canaletto, because he was the overshadowed nephew and pupil of the famous painter of the carnivals, gondolas, piazzas and waters of 18th-century Venice. But Bellotto went north, and used the skills his uncle taught him to paint a less picturesque, more troubled Europe.

Steve Cooper has departed Swansea City by mutual consent after growing unsettled. The head coach led Swansea to successive Championship play-off finishes but made clear his concerns over the direction of the club.
The 41-year-old took Swansea to the play-off final last season on a modest budget. The club were keen to offer Cooper, whose deal runs until next summer, a new contract following defeat by Brentford at Wembley but the former England Under-17 manager was reluctant to enter talks. Cooper was of interest to Crystal Palace before the Premier League club appointed Patrick Vieira, and his work at Swansea also attracted attention from Fulham, who appointed Marco Silva.

The Guardian's Africa correspondent, Jason Burke, explains how the violence was sparked by more than just the jailing of the former president Jacob Zuma, and what impact it could have on a country where more than half of the population lives in poverty

South Africa’s leaders fear fresh wave of violence by Zuma loyalists

Is it possible that the unblemished integrity of Tom Hanks is the only thing standing between us and total mental collapse? If he were to be caught up in any #MeToo-type revelations, or secret racist affiliations were revealed, I don’t know how we’d cope. From sea to shining sea, he is not just admired but beloved. So beloved, in fact, that the love may even outpace the admiration – perhaps because his particular talent is, by its very nature, almost invisible.
Hanks is the man you go to when you want unshowy relatability. When your movie will live or die by the success of audiences investing everything in the average-looking guy rather than being dazzled by a star and his jawline. When you want the ordinary made compelling, when you want a man who can bring all the deepest emotions to life in the smallest ways (his technique is a miracle of compression), you want Hanks.

Keir Starmer will self-isolate after one of his children tested positive for Covid, hours after the Labour leader appeared in the House of Commons for prime minister’s questions.
The Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is understood to be concerned about the growing number of people being forced into isolation, and told colleagues he hopes that the final day parliament sits on Thursday will be as quiet as possible, with MPs attending remotely.

In court custody battles over the past few years, a new term, “parental alienation”, has taken root. The phrase – based on a “syndrome” that has been internationally discredited and is banned from use in family courts in some countries – is based on the idea that one parent brainwashes a child to distance it from the other parent, who is blameless. Children’s wishes and feelings are often seen as manipulated and therefore are often discounted by the family courts and professionals.
I have watched, horrified, as parental alienation has become the go-to litigation tactic, often used by domestic abusers to discredit allegations made against them by their ex-partner. Although parental alienation can be raised by either parent, overwhelmingly I see it being deployed as a counter-allegation by fathers when mothers try to prove they or their children have been subjected to abuse.

Priti Patel revealed late on Tuesday that she had agreed to pay the sum as part of a deal with the French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, to double the number of officers patrolling the French coast.

‘Albert Hirst’s pies were legendary,” recalls Ian McMillan, the poet known as the Bard of Barnsley. He’s talking about his favourite exhibit at Experience Barnsley: a carrier bag for the long defunct butchers. “Personally, I prefer Potters of Wombwell. But that’s heresy for many. People sniff the Albert Hirst bag like it’s a holy relic, which in a sense it is. And then they argue about who made the best pies and go into reveries about their aromas.” 
Experience Barnsley is one of the five museums that have made the shortlist for the Art Fund Museum of the Year prize. The winner, announced in September, will get £100,000 and the other four £15,000 apiece. Deeply rooted in their communities, each one is keen to revolutionise what a museum can be in the 21st century.

“LGBTQ activists visit kindergartens and schools and conduct sexual education classes. They want to do this here in Hungary as well,” said Orbán in a Facebook video statement placed on Wednesday.

The secret of top-level selection is to heighten the sense of pre-game anticipation. If the team sheet can not only energise your own players but also make the opposition feel faintly uneasy, so much the better. Warren Gatland has ticked both those boxes; now we must wait and see whether it will trick the Boks.
South Africa will certainly be scanning Gatland’s selection warily. Not since Jason Robinson skipped thrillingly around Australia’s Chris Latham at the Gabba exactly 20 years ago has a Lions side looked better equipped to make a more proactive start to a series. Gatland has been bold – eye-catchingly so in some cases – and has put together a team that looks specifically primed to take the game to their hosts.

You would expect a song called Dancing Shoes to celebrate the unfettered joy of a good boogie, but Network Rapso Riddum Band’s 1981 track did quite the opposite. Lead vocalist Brother Resistance – whose death on 13 July sent shockwaves through the Caribbean music community – used Dancing Shoes to castigate his fellow Trinidadians for embracing foreign forms such as disco, delivering caustic lyrics in a flow laden with preacherly indignation.
The song heralded the arrival of a new hybrid sound in Trinidad and Tobago – one that hasn’t had quite the global impact of dancehall, reggae or other Caribbean styles but which is the source of some of its most fascinating and political music, dubbed “rapso” for its melding of rap and soca.

Sometimes I think it makes sense as a covert government anti-Covid strategy (now that they’ve given up on overt, data-driven, scientifically sanctioned ones): give the public a new dating show in which people are done up as figures from a plushy fetishist’s (look it up, I don’t have time to explain everything) malarial dream. This will keep them spellbound with delight, or weeping silently into the sofa at the thought that the western civilisation we once hoped for is over. But, either way indoors, alone, spreading nary an airborne droplet to the young and vulnerable.
I believe it to be a multi-pronged public health strategy. First they softened us up with last week’s Apocalypse Wow on ITV2, which left the nation staring bleakly past its television screens into an unknowable future that seemed suddenly not to brim with overwhelming possibility for humanity and its endeavours. Now there is Netflix’s Sexy Beasts, a reworking of a BBC show from 2014 with no other possible justification. What comes next, I cannot imagine. After a nugatory attempt, the mind quails and halts, unwilling to go further. Thus, do I fight to explain the advent of this monstrosity into our lives.

If you happen to see an unusually large number of women with red hair today, do not be alarmed. We haven’t been invaded by vikings again, nor is there a Nicola from Girls Aloud convention happening in your vicinity. There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for the sudden outbreak of redheads, and it is that Black Widow was recently released.
According to the website Justmylook, there has been a 163% spike in demand for the colour since the release of Black Widow, presumably because lots of people sat through two hours and 14 minutes of a film about a woman grappling with the psychological torment of knowing she was part of a Soviet military programme that brainwashed, sterilised and murdered hundreds of abandoned girls, only to think: “Ooh, I bet I’d look lovely with her hair.”

In this heat, today, people are harvesting raspberries and strawberries, packing deliveries in warehouses and distribution centres, delivering food and documents on bikes and mopeds. Some of them will have to do these jobs without regular breaks or access to drinking water. Some are required to wear uniforms designed for much cooler weather. Many are the same low-paid key workers who risked infection getting us through the pandemic, and are now exposed to dangerous temperatures.

Gutsy, garlicky gazpacho may be more famous internationally, but quieter, creamier ajo blanco is my soup of choice when the temperature soars past the point where solid food appeals. Almonds have been a staple in sunny Andalusia since they were introduced by the Romans, and here they combine with stale bread to make an unlikely, but uniquely refreshing light lunch or starter.

Of course, this is something you might expect to hear from the co-owner of a Capel Curig hostel. However, even an old Snowdonia hand like me had to admit that the view from the hostel of the Snowdon horseshoe, the ridges on the mountain’s eastern side, is indeed pretty spectacular.

High-resolution computer models suggest that slow-moving storms could become 14 times more common over land by the end of the century in a worst-case scenario. The slower a storm moves, the more rain it dumps on a small area and the greater the risk of serious flooding.

After a year’s delay and months of rancour, finally some Olympic sport. Few will remember the details of Yukiko Ueno’s opening pitch to Michelle Cox in Japan’s softball match against Australia in Fukushima on Wednesday morning. But her delivery, witnessed by the organising committee president, Seiko Hashimoto, signalled that the most bizarre Games of modern times really are happening.
Depending on how deep the world’s reserves of optimism run, the first action of the 2020 Games could mark a turning point for the troubled Olympics or, more likely, bring only ephemeral relief from the viral cloud that hangs over the host city, Tokyo.

Had a particular event in 2015 not occurred, the government adviser Emily Hunt would be using her skills in research, politics and communications in very different ways. Instead, for almost a year, the 42-year-old has been the voice of sexual assault victims, advising the government in the run-up to its landmark review into the shockingly low number of rape prosecutions. This review offered something fairly surprising: a clear admission of failure – and an apology. Victims of rape, said ministers, “are being failed” and the lack of convictions is something “of which we are deeply ashamed”.
“I’m a firm believer that you can’t change anything unless you admit that something’s gone wrong,” says Hunt. “The apology was the government recognising that something’s gone really badly wrong.” What it means now, she says, is: “We have to do better.”

I am a 66-year-old woman 11 years out of a 30-year marriage. My husband left to live with the woman he had been having an affair with, but the marriage hadn’t been right for some years and our sexual activity had diminished drastically. I have a male friend who is the same age as me and we are friends with benefits – only the benefits don’t work. He can’t penetrate me. Either I have shrunk or he is just a big lad (after 30 years of monogamy, I am not exactly au fait with penis sizes). It makes me feel sad and inadequate. We pleasure each other in other ways, but it would appear penetration is off the table. Before I consult a doctor, what am I doing wrong?
You are not doing anything wrong. In fact, it is wonderful that you understand the erotic value of non-penetrative sex. Some men with atypically large penises struggle to find women who can accommodate them, but it is not certain that your friend falls into this category. After a long period of abstinence – and most likely hormonal diminution – some women do experience some vaginal atrophy that restricts penetration with a penis of any size.

The first time I rescued an animal was almost 15 years ago, while I was on hiatus from my band, Garbage, in 2007. Shuffling around Los Angeles with little to occupy my time and my catastrophic imagination, my husband suggested we might consider adopting a rescue dog from one of the local shelters. I was a little hesitant at first. It struck me as a massive undertaking (I was not wrong) and I was unsure I had the emotional capacity to engage in the love of a small, defenceless, living thing.
My mother had just been diagnosed with Pick’s disease, a criminally aggressive form of dementia that can take a person, as it did my mother, out of the game in less than two years from the day of diagnosis. I was deeply disturbed by the course her disease was taking and finding it hard to connect with life in any joyful, meaningful way.

In a comedy sketch that was released to promote her 2019 debut Compliments Please, Rebecca Lucy Taylor is grilled about the imagined impact of the album 20 years on (it was so great, it “destroyed music as we know it”). With a transatlantic accent, impeded facial movement and wearing a tiara over a turban , she faces a hostile male interviewer who attempts to sum up her revolutionary sound: it is “melodic complaining”, “poor-me periodcore”, and “menstrual madness set to music”.
“That’s what it is!” cackles Taylor, two years on. “Can’t deny it!” It’s true that the 34-year-old – better known by her nom de disque, Self Esteem – makes music packed with warts-and-all honesty and, yes, a certain amount of justified complaining. Topics include toxic relationships and the insidious effects of the patriarchy. But her songs are also maximalist, danceable and infectiously fun – a wholesale rejection of the restrained indie-folk of her previous band Slow Club. “I’m trying to do a Trojan horse thing,” explains Taylor over a cup of coffee in her PR team’s dazzlingly white offices. “You think you’re getting this sugary injection of a pop song but it’s going to leave you with something more.”

Inside Holland’s beach hut, the 62-year-old retired headteacher keeps a double-ring stove, a frying pan, a griddle pan, graffiti removal wipes, and, best of all, a loo. “You sit on this,” Holland says merrily, unfolding a portable toilet seat for my benefit, “and go in here.”

When Toa, the orphaned baby orca, sees food coming he sticks his large pink tongue out of his wide gummy mouth in happy anticipation. He gurgles and belches as he hungrily tugs at the specially designed latex teat. Four volunteers in wetsuits and beanies cradle him and coo that he is “a good boy” as he feeds. When he is done, he rolls over, revealing his cream white skin, and nudges a volunteer for a belly rub. If they dare stop, he nudges them again. When he is excited he zooms about his holding pool, playing with the volunteers, and when a large tentacle-like piece of kelp is heaved into the water, he snuggles under it, as though it were a blanket, or the protective weight of his missing mother.
The young calf, thought to be between two and six months old, became stranded in the rocks near Plimmerton, north of Wellington 10 days ago with minor injuries.

In March 2017, a 38-year-old freelance reporter named Cecilio Pineda Birto was shot dead in Altamirano, a town in the southern Mexican region of Tierra Caliente – a battleground for organised crime factions. His phone vanished from the crime scene. A few weeks earlier, a number connected to that phone had been selected as a possible surveillance target by a client of the spyware company NSO group.
The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani tells Michael Safi that this story is illustrative of the dangers faced by journalists in Mexico. The mobile numbers of 15,000 Mexicans including politicians, judges, activists and teachers appear in the data leak of possible surveillance targets. Included in that are at least 50 people linked to Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador – his wife, children, aides and doctor. Appearing on the leaked list does not mean that a number was attacked, or that an infection was attempted and NSO insists the database has “no relevance” to the company.

Unusually heavy rains and massive flooding have hit China’s Henan province, bursting the banks of rivers, overwhelming dams and the public transport system and upending the lives of tens of millions.
Twelve people have been killed in the provincial capital, Zhengzhou, where more than 20cm (7.8in) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday. About 100,000 people have been moved to shelters, state media Xinhua reported on Wednesday, citing local government.

In Gary McNair’s jovial audio play, a woman rediscovers a connection with her home town and her dead father by following a Scottish football team for a season
Who doesn’t love an underdog? When Brora Rangers played eight-times Scottish cup winners Hearts in March, they enjoyed a perfect David-and-Goliath victory. The part-time team from a town with a population of 800 beat the side with the fourth biggest budget in Scottish football. For their fans, the Highlanders’ 2-1 victory was a tremendous pay-off.
Playwright Gary McNair would understand their dogged loyalty. Produced for David Greig’s Sound Stage series of audio plays, and loosely based on Ron Ferguson’s book of the same name, Black Diamonds and the Blue Brazil is about supporters of Cowdenbeath, whose chant “We’re shite and we know we are” reveals a merry acceptance of defeat.

Eoin Morgan’s team are the favourites for the World Cup later this year and it is their ability to come through in pressure moments like this that has earned them that reputation. Set 155 to win, the hosts were wobbling on 112 for four after 15 overs of the chase before a partnership of 31 between Morgan and Dawid Malan steadied things.

Netflix missed its growth forecasts in the last quarter, blaming a post-lockdown decline in interest in the streaming service and a Covid-related slowdown in new productions.
The company added 1.54 million new subscribers, below the 1.75 million analysts had expected and a fraction of the 10 million it added in the second quarter a year earlier, when much of the world was in lockdown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[McQueen and James Rogan’s remarkable, intimate documentary meets the survivors of the 1981 fire and looks at its shocking aftermath
The New Cross fire, which happened on 18 January 1981, ran through Steve McQueen’s Small Axe series of films, two of them in particular. It was there as a silent counterpart to Lovers Rock, a kind of photographic negative to the communal joy and celebration of that house party, and it was directly depicted in Alex Wheatle, as one of the sparks that ignited the Brixton Riots. In Uprising (BBC One), McQueen and his co-director James Rogan tell the story of the fire and its aftermath in documentary form, over three primetime episodes. It is brilliant and furious and human.
Thirteen young Black British people were killed at a joint birthday party that night, in a fire widely believed to have been an act of arson committed by racists. The approach Uprising takes is twofold. First, it establishes the cultural context, painting an unflattering portrait of Britain in the 1970s and early 80s. The National Front is on the rise and marching. The police are widely racist; George Rhoden, who joined the force at 16 and was called a traitor by his friends for it, recalls a fellow officer brazenly showing off the National Front badge he had pinned to the inside of his raincoat, just as they were about to police a National Front march. Thatcher’s 1978 rhetoric is ugly and exploitative; she says that “people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture”. Newspapers reported muggings as crimes exclusively committed by young black men on old white women. “It felt like they wanted to purge us from the streets,” says the real Wheatle, who appears here as one of many interviewees.

Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, admits to sleepless nights. Athletes and journalists increasingly fear their Games could end with a ping on their phone and a 14-day spell in quarantine. And when Toshiro Muto, head of the Tokyo organising committee, was asked on Tuesday whether the Games could yet be cancelled, his vague reply became interpreted as a hint the Olympics could yet be in peril at the 11th hour.
Such headlines did not merely jump the gun. They also pole‑vaulted spectacularly clear of the cavalry.

Bezos hails ‘best day ever’ after successful Blue Origin flight

Wally Funk, a pilot who was denied the chance to go into space in the 1960s because she was a woman, said “I want to go again, fast”, after returning from a successful flight with the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos.
With Bezos’s brother, Mark, and an 18-year-old Dutch student, Oliver Daemen, the pair spent 11 minutes on Tuesday on a suborbital flight conducted by Blue Origin, Bezos’s space flight company.

For three long years running up until the very first ball is bowled at 6.30pm on Wednesday, the organisers of the Hundred have been desperately trying to stamp out fires. The question now is whether the biggest change to English cricket in modern times catches alight.
Over the next 32 days there is a new eight-team, seven-city tournament in town, backed by an unprecedented marketing budget for domestic cricket and two heavyweight broadcasters in Sky and the BBC. It is looking to engage a brand new audience, while at the same time winning over existing supporters who dislike the concept and, more broadly, what it does to the sport they love. In short, a fair old challenge.

Lulu Lakatos allegedly posed as a gemologist and pretended to examine and value seven diamonds at the Boodles showroom on New Bond Street in Mayfair, central London.

“My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it,” Boris Johnson declared many years ago. The joke has served his career so well that he has often returned to the theme, making promises without fretting about his ability to keep them. Countries cannot dodge consequences so easily. In a pandemic, complacency, mixed messages and erratic policy are more than wasteful and enraging. They are lethal.
The prime minister hoped, as everyone once did, that vaccines might allow a full return to normal life. For now at least, they are only part of a solution. On “freedom day”, the UK recorded almost 40,000 cases: a 41% rise in a week. More than one million schoolchildren in England were absent for Covid-related reasons last week. The health service is already feeling the strain. Businesses are closing, services suffering and families cancelling longed-for holidays due to self-isolation requirements. The pings from the app are not the problem, but the symptom: cases are soaring.

As much of the nation focused with growing trepidation on “freedom day” last week, an eye-opening report on the unequal economics of Covid went slightly under the radar. Looking at a range of indicators, researchers from the Resolution Foundation thinktank did the maths on how 16 months of lockdown had affected households’ wealth. The stark conclusion was that the pandemic had “turbo-charged” the already yawning gap between the rich and the poor.
Unlike the aftermath of the 2008 crash, when asset prices joined a general economic nosedive, the pandemic produced the oddity of a boom in the middle of a recession. Property values, partly driven by government action to stimulate demand, are now significantly above pre-pandemic levels. Share prices have also been buoyant, although fears over the ongoing spread of the Delta variant led to a downturn this week. Savings amassed while working at home contributed to a £900bn increase in total household wealth. At the top end of the scale, the gap between the richest 10% of families and the median family grew to 55 times the typical household income. By contrast, at the bottom end, families lost income while on furlough, or worked fewer hours, ending up with greater debt than when the pandemic began.

In his first TV interview since quitting as one of the most senior advisers in No 10, Cummings levelled repeated criticism of his former boss, saying aides feared Johnson had no plan to run the country and was only obsessed with “stupid” infrastructure projects.

I found out I was pregnant on an otherwise ordinary Wednesday in early April, ordinary except for the fact I’d been counting down to this day, the earliest possible I’d permit myself a test. Three minutes of averting my eyes for fear of jinxing the result and then the faint blue cross confirming what I’d already known for a week, with no proof but for a barely perceptible shift inside me, somewhere previously unknowable.
So began a blissful time, a sweet introduction to the ongoing paradox of pregnancy: a complete shrinking of the outer world alongside a glorious expanse of our inner lives. And then the sickness kicked in – already the bliss was a distant and inaccessible memory.

But even while I dutifully glued a picture of Jess’ love interest (Jonathan Rhys Meyer) to the back of my journal (he was the first hot white guy I saw actively pursue an Indian girl, so I pledged my adolescent heart to him forever), I felt a little icky about the film.

If you live by the sword you tend to die by the sword. The same is true of social media – just ask Chrissy Teigen. Over the past decade, the model and cookbook author has risen to dizzying levels of fame by virtue of being good at posting things online. Such is her reach that Donald Trump, who disapproved of Teigen’s “filthy mouth”, blocked her on Twitter while he was president. Joe Biden, meanwhile, followed her the minute he became president. Which was a big deal considering Biden’s official @POTUS account only followed 11 people at the time, all of whom were aides or official White House accounts. The president doesn’t follow the Queen of the UK, but he did follow the unofficial Queen of Twitter. He also unfollowed Teigen a few weeks later at her behest; the pressure of having the most powerful man in the world read your tweets was too much to deal with, apparently.
If Biden hadn’t unfollowed Teigen in February, he would probably be distancing himself from her now. A lot of big brands reportedly are. Thanks to a cyberbullying scandal, the influencer has gone from tastemaker to toxic. While Teigen may once have been online royalty, half the internet now seems to be aggressively screaming, “Off with her head!”

Far from being the femme fatale depicted by those who didn’t know her, Joan was a woman of limitless wit, generosity and humour.
She grew up in Ramsgate, Kent, where she was born to Fred Long and his wife, Lass (nee Jones), into a family where money was stretched and emotions “were volatile and easily roused; none of us was ever able to hide joy, sorrow or irritation for long”.

The climate crisis and to a lesser extent overfishing could threaten the world’s supply of essential vitamins and minerals gained from fisheries, according to research.
Globally, 1 billion people rely on fish and seafood as their primary source of protein. Fish is also a key source of micronutrients – vitamins and minerals such as omega 3, calcium and iron – critical for the body’s health. A deficiency in these can cause a range of dangerous health conditions as well as reductions in energy levels and mental clarity.

In seaside Folkestone on one of the hottest days of the year, the ethereal glitter of the English Channel merged with the empty azure sky. So why did an artwork by Mike Stubbs have to spoil it? That flaming van was a low blow. But there it was, parked on the quay, painted hot-rod red, yellow and black with images of blazing forests. It is called Climate Emergency Services and is even equipped with a gun, perhaps for shooting down denial.
Stubbs demonstrates that it does not always pay to be subtle. I had my appreciation of a sunny day suddenly ruined by his crudely powerful reminder that our weather is no longer natural. But Climate Emergency Services is also a challenge to much of the other art in this three-yearly festival of public art in a chaotically lovely town. Art today is at a crossroads: has it got the right to be sophisticated entertainment or should it be hammering us with home truths?

Coronavirus – latest updates

Border officials are no longer required to make basic Covid checks on people arriving in England from green and amber list countries, according to leaked instructions that have prompted claims that the government is turning a blind eye to the risk of importing Covid cases.
A change that came into effect on Monday means Border Force officers no longer have to verify whether new arrivals have received a negative Covid test, have booked a test within coming days, or have a passenger locator form showing an address where they will isolate if necessary.

My sister Maxine Hambleton was murdered in the Birmingham pub bombings in 1974. The decision by Boris Johnson’s government to introduce a statute of limitations on atrocities linked to the bizarrely named “Troubles” (Report, 14 July) is yet another punch in the face for the victims of terrorism linked to Ireland.
Once an amnesty is granted to terrorists and murderers, we can forget about the rule of law. Our government will have replaced it with the rule of the gun and the bomb. History shows that when you allow murderous zealots the opportunity to slaughter without any repercussions, they revel in that weakness.

The debate in the Guardian (Outrage aimed at No 10 as MPs back £4bn cut to foreign aid budget, 13 July; Letters, 15 July) over the past few days has only contributed to the continuation of a fundamental error that is literally costing millions of lives in the global south. None of the politicians or correspondents who have intervened in the discussions have emphasised the profound conflict between aid and development. The two are usually presented as synonymous – they are not.
Because we have nurtured very little development to enable poor people in poor countries to stand on their own two feet, we have had to give them more aid. We have not helped them develop their own agency. We have not enabled them to develop agriculture to meet their own needs, encouraged governments to undertake land reform, educated women farmers, facilitated local seed multiplication or created local agricultural colleges.

 4.23pm BST 
The UK has reported its worst daily death toll since March, even as England lifts almost all Covid measures, the government in Westminster has said.
A further 96 people died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Tuesday; the highest reported daily figure since 24 March. It brings the UK’s total to 128,823. As of 9am, there had been a further 46,558 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in the UK, offiial figures show.
 4.13pm BST 
New infections in France are increasing at an unprecedented rate due to the Delta variant, after 18,000 cases were reported for the previous 24 hours, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports, citing the health minister Olivier Véran. The news agency reports. Addressing the French parliament, he said:
That means we have an increase in the spread of the virus of around 150 percent in the last week: we’ve never seen that, neither with Covid [the original form], nor the British variant, nor the South African or the Brazilian one.
Addressing vaccine sceptics, Veran said the new figures showed that ‘this is no time for doubts and hesitation’ and that achieving herd immunity through a high degree of vaccine coverage is ‘the only way we have ...of getting rid of Covid once and for all’.
He was speaking as parliament was due to debate a set of controversial new rules aimed at pressuring millions of vaccine holdouts into getting a jab, since only 45% of the population is fully vaccinated.

The UK has recored 96 further coronavirus deaths, according to the latest update to the government’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest daily total on this measure for almost four months (since 24 March, when 98 deaths were recorded). And the total number of deaths over the past week is up 60.6% on the total for the previous week.
There have also been 46,558 new cases. Week on week, new cases are up 40.7%.
 3.39pm BST 
On the World at One Justin Madders, a shadow health minister, suggested that Labour might vote against plans to make vaccine passports mandatory for people wanting to go to a nightclub. The party would have to look at the legislation before taking a final decision, he said. But he said:
We’ve been very clear from the outset that we consider requiring vaccine passports as a condition of entry discriminatory against those people who may not be able to have the vaccine. And of course, as we know at the moment, actually having the vaccine is no guarantee that you are not carrying the virus ....
There is a real concern that if we move into this without any testing as a backup it creates a very unfair situation, also creates a very dangerous situation, because it creates a false sense of security that actually they are protected when they might not be.

Here is a documentary of pretty niche interest, it has to be said: the life and times of Tour de France commentator Phil Liggett, who was a ubiquitous fixture on TV coverage of the event in English-speaking countries for years. Well, Liggett appears to be an interesting character, if John Craven looked a bit like Terence Stamp and held forth with a touch of Alan Partridge, but with a runtime of a shade under two hours, this is pushing it a bit.
Born on the Wirral, and currently residing with his wife Trish in a game reserve in South Africa where he helps with efforts to protect rhinos from poachers, Liggett is one of those old-school sports broadcasters – like John Motson or Clive Everton – whose natural communication skills and unswerving celebration of their discipline have inserted themselves into the minds of generations of TV audiences though sheer familiarity. This profile is at its most entertaining when describing Liggett’s early journey from highly rated amateur racer into sports journalism, and then to TV commentary in the mid-70s – Liggett says he was so unnerved by a phone call from legendary silver-fox World of Sport presenter Dickie Davies that he forgot to start commenting on his first live transmission.

The announcement from the ice-cream maker, which has also taken political stances on the climate crisis and social justice issues such as Black Lives Matter, is one of the highest-profile rebukes of Israeli settlement building to date by a well-known brand.

Claudia Weill’s career as a director of feature films lasted just two years but she had an enormous impact. Girlfriends, her 1978 debut about two young female New Yorkers being pulled in different directions was a tiny independent film, but its influence has been rippling out ever since, detectable most notably in the work of Greta Gerwig and Lena Dunham.
“It’s only a joy,” says Weill, of seeing others pick up where she left off. “We all inspire each other.” Weill certainly thinks Frances Ha, which starred and was co-written by Greta Gerwig, took some inspiration from Girlfriends. “But it was a completely different film,” she adds, “and women’s friendships are a big subject.”

An Oxford University paper dubbed by the Daily Mail an “anti-lockdown” plan has emerged as the likely inspiration behind Boris Johnson’s messages declaring “get Covid and live longer”.
The WhatsApp messages revealed by his former chief aide, Dominic Cummings, showed the prime minister was holding out against lockdown measures as cases spiralled in October 2020 and appear to suggest he was unconcerned by the deaths of people in their 80s.

Luke Prokop of the Nashville Predators became the first active player under an NHL contract to come out as gay on Tuesday, only a month after Carl Nassib became the first NFL player to do so. To me, someone who has loved and admired sports his whole life, this is historic and groundbreaking news. But to the next generation of young sports fans and players, including my nephews and nieces, this is the new normal. Though it’s just a start, it is difficult for me to express how much joy the idea of that future gives me.

Have they not already been going to school? Sorry, I’m out of the loop on coronavirus stuff. Is it still happening? Are we still doing coronavirus? Can a Tory MP text Laura Kuenssberg or Robert Peston what the new rules actually are so they can tweet them verbatim and I can figure out whether I’m legally allowed to go buy milk or not?
Anyway, we’re free again, but free crucially in that very English way, where anti-lockdown protesters are still protesting the lockdown we’re not in and we can enjoy freedom only under the Damoclean sword of the current government, which – and yes, I understand I am being pessimistic, but my psyche is irreparably wounded by the past 16 months of chaos – is always on the periphery, circling, threatening to take it all away. Enjoy your freedom, chaps! Enjoy your freedom, chapettes! But if any one of you steps out of line we’ll take back all the pubs and burn them to the ground.

HMV at 100: ‘I worry they will go bust for good’

The owner of music and entertainment chain HMV said it was planning to open 10 new stores this year but warned there would be many more vacant shops on UK high streets unless the government fixed business rates.
The music and film retailer, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this month, said online sales had more than doubled over the past year, with sales tripling in some weeks, but Doug Putman, the toy entrepreneur who bought 100 HMV stores out of administration in 2019, said overall sales for the group were “heavily down” as stores had been forced to temporarily close during the Covid-related high street lockdowns.

This time last year Victoria was enduring its long winter of Covid isolation. Other states were cautiously loosening restrictions. Most Australians were clinging to the assumption that the pandemic would end, sometime. Vaccines would be developed and, once we’d all got them, the threat would be over. We just had to hang in there until it was done.
Now the idea of a neat end point is far less certain because mutated versions of the virus keep slipping through our defences and closing down our lives again, just as we dare to make even the most modest of plans.

Though the leading opera director Sir Graham Vick, who has died aged 67 from complications of Covid-19, worked on many of the world’s most prestigious stages, he blazed a trail with his own brand of low-budget productions in unconventional venues. There he rejected lavish mises-en-scènes in favour of emotionally charged, psychologically revealing, often interactive, dramaturgy.
At the time of his death, he was artistic director of the Birmingham Opera Company (BOC, formerly the City of Birmingham Touring Opera), which he founded in 1987, energetically creating groundbreaking work initially in such sites as aircraft hangars, power stations and nightclubs. The company eventually obtained its own theatre in a converted ice-rink, which the city council agreed to refurbish and run.

John Kerry, appointed by Joe Biden to spearhead the US’s international efforts to tackle the crisis, urged all large economies to come forward with new plans to cut emissions before the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow this November.

Our social care system has been a national disgrace for years, leaving thousands without the care they need and many others facing financial ruin because of the misfortune of needing healthcare in specific areas the NHS does not cover. If anyone thought the status quo was acceptable pre-pandemic, the past 18 months have hopefully changed their minds. Starting to put this right will cost in the region of £10bn a year.

The report opened with a quote from Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, outlining a “triple threat” to public service media, “from large global players, viewers turning towards online services, and increasing funding pressures”.
But no mention was made of a more insidious threat to UK public broadcasting in 2021. This is the determined and sustained efforts to turn Britain’s largest public service broadcaster, the BBC, into a politically tinged state news service – of the sort you might expect to find in Viktor Orbán’s Hungary.

The eye-catching recommendation on benefits is part of a wider set of Social Mobility Commission (SMC) proposals to put disadvantaged youngsters at the heart of the UK’s pandemic recovery, and comes a fortnight after ministers confirmed they would end the £20 a week universal credit top-up in the autumn.

Amateur boxing is often scarred by chaos and duplicity, with unpredictable draws and dubious officiating, and some great fighters at past Olympic Games have had their dreams ruined. But all seven men and four women in the GB boxing team have reason to hope that, with a favourable draw and a sustained burst of form, they could win a medal in Tokyo. It helps that the new Boxing Task Force, set up by the IOC to run the qualifying events as well as the Tokyo programme, appears to have improved the standard and fairness of judging.
There are also clear boxing reasons for British optimism before the first bell. This squad has a deeper pool of talent than the previous two GB Olympic boxing teams which won five medals at London 2012 and then three at the Rio Games in 2016.

• Boris Johnson to delay social care plans until autumn
The reason governments of both left and right have taken so long to sort out Britain’s social care system comes down to one word: money.
Ministers know that more cash will be needed to cope with the demands of an ageing population. They know that the current system is inadequate. They also know that a long-term solution does not come cheap and that somebody has to pay.

Muslims in England were able to pray shoulder to shoulder for the first time since the start of the pandemic after social distancing restrictions were eased just in time for the start of Eid al-Adha.
“We’re actually having two celebrations in one: one is the Eid celebration, the other one is freedom – to be able to come together, stand shoulder to shoulder, and see friends and family that people haven’t seen for a long, long time,” said Mohammed Arif from the Walsall Union of Muslim Organisations, which is putting on an Eid-in-the-park event for the first time to bring worshippers outside where infection risk is reduced.

Negotiations had been taking place over recent days in the hope of getting agreement between Johnson, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, about how a cap on lifetime costs could be funded.

With a receding hairline and sporting a plaid blazer, a man in his late-30s growls the lyrics to a song sung from the perspective of a pigeon into his mic. “I may be the most dispensable, disgusting, shit – but at least I know how to fly!” run the monotonous Russian words, bellowed across the stage. To accompany the singing, the man spasms and contorts his body and face with the clumsy precision of a broken marionette.
The year is 1987, and the Soviet rock band Zvuki Mu (Sounds of Mu), at the dawn of their musical career, are performing a concert airing on official state television. The audience members smile and bob their heads, some bewildered, and others comforted by this bizarre showman whose familiar appearance more closely resembles a neighbourhood tram conductor than a rock star.

Three series is the usual tenure for an actor playing the Doctor, so rumours are rife that Jodie Whittaker is about to step down. Michaela Coel, Olly Alexander and Richard Ayoade are among those tipped for the role. But what if, instead of a new Doctor, the show actually needs something a doctor might prescribe to an exhausted patient – a rest.
The current run started in 2005, and even with such a flexible format as Doctor Who, there aren’t many TV dramas that can sustain 13 series in 16 years. (Call the Midwife is probably the best BBC attempt at that in the past decade.) Soap operas can manage it, but then soap storylines generally don’t revolve around such cataclysmic events as the universe being destroyed.

Announced on 16 July and due to launch in December, the Steam Deck features a 7in LCD touchscreen, an array of analogue and touch-pad controls, a gyroscope for motion detection, wifi connectivity and a base station so it can be hooked up to a monitor. Tech-wise, it’s built around a custom Zen 2 AMD processor, AMD RDNA 2 GPU and 16GB of memory.

Downing Street has urged people to isolate if they are “pinged” by the NHS app, after the business minister, Paul Scully, suggested individuals and employers could choose to ignore the instructions.
No 10 said employers “should not be encouraging” workers to ignore isolation warnings, even though the app’s instructions are not legally enforceable, unlike contact from NHS test and trace, which is a legal requirement.

The G20 countries have provided more than $3.3tn (£2.4tn) in subsidies for fossil fuels since the Paris climate agreement was sealed in 2015, a report shows, despite many committing to tackle the crisis.
This backing for coal, oil and gas is “​​reckless” in the face of the escalating climate emergency, according to the report’s authors, and urgent action is needed to phase out the support. The $3.3tn could have built solar plants equivalent to three times the US electricity grid, the report says.

I was a late adopter of Jackie Leven, really. His new wave band Doll by Doll had passed me by. But then I saw a review in the music press that mentioned a singer-songwriter with muscular lyrics and good guitar playing – and from Fife. My ears pricked up. I managed to find a couple of his CDs in a shop. I was writing an Inspector Rebus novel at the time, and not only did I like Shining Brother Shining Sister, but I thought my guy Rebus would like it as well.
And so, in the next Rebus book, Rebus is happily listening to a Jackie Leven album at home. I didn’t realise Jackie was a fan of the books. He was sitting on an aeroplane somewhere over Scandinavia and he suddenly saw himself mentioned. I don’t know how much of a crime fiction reader he was, but he was confronted in my books by a larger-than-life male character, John Rebus, who is flawed, complex and awkward socially, who has problems falling in and out of love, and whose job makes him often quite a lonely figure. And I think Jackie got all of that – he got this notion of a person who is wandering through a city and through a life, looking for meaning.

Amid growing concern over the apparent abuse of NSO’s powerful phone-hacking spyware, Pegasus, Amazon confirmed it had already cut some of its ties to the Israeli surveillance company. The stock price of Apple dipped amid worries about the privacy and security of its handsets.

The “big fishes” who masterminded the assassination of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, remain at large, a senior government minister has admitted, as the Caribbean country unveiled a new prime minister in a bid to defuse a burgeoning struggle for power.
Police have named two Haitian citizens as key suspects in the murder: a Florida-based pastor called Christian Emmanuel Sanon and the former intelligence officer Joseph Felix Badio. On Friday Colombia’s police chief, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, claimed Badio might have given the order for two retired Colombian soldiers to assassinate Moïse in the early hours of 7 July for reasons that remain obscure. Sanon was arrested in Haiti last week, and Badio’s whereabouts are unknown.

In the next four months or so, the world will find out whether it is possible for one branch of the US federal government – the state department - to accuse Chinese officials of committing genocide, and for another branch – led by the special envoy on climate change, John Kerry – to persuade China to transform the way its dirty economy operates. Is it possible simultaneously to compete for mastery of the world and to collaborate to save that world?
The outcome of this diplomatic experiment will become known at the British-hosted Cop26 in Glasgow convened to try to put the world on course for only 1.5C of warming. All countries are expected to produce their nationally determined contributions – how much they will reduce their carbon footprint. British officials insist Cop26 is about more than China and the US, but without these two players, jointly responsible for 40% of global green house gas emissions, nothing meaningful is achievable.

A once-illuminated sign featuring a Jack Russell called Nipper sits above some hoardings on Oxford Street in London. Head cocked to one side, he appears disappointed that there’s no music emerging from the gramophone he’s quizzically scrutinising. There’s still a poster claiming it’s been the “home of entertainment since 1921”, but it’s reportedly now home to squatters, including Piers Corbyn.
HMV’s 363 Oxford Street branch is shuttered, the remnants of a once famous high street presence still lingering on its facade. The company celebrates its centenary this month, and after soldiering on through store closures and bankruptcy in recent years, had almost become profitable in its May 2020 financial results – despite, at that point, three months of Covid-enforced closure. Given the ride that the record industry and the high street has experienced since the beginning of the 21st century – including during the pandemic – reaching this anniversary seems miraculous.

Lionel Messi is unemployed. Don’t worry: he will still be at Barcelona next season, or he should be, and he will certainly be OK. The question now may be: will they? And if he plays at the Camp Nou, if they are able to cut costs and raise the funds that they desperately need to balance the books and allow him to re-sign and begin an 18th season at the club where now more than ever he is their everything, if they can somehow, somewhere find over €100m and fast, who will play alongside him?
A year after he tried to walk away, Barcelona insist that they are no longer concerned about Messi leaving. Last week, with pressure building and sponsors expressing uncertainty, they let it be known that they had reached an agreement on a deal that would keep him there until he is 39, new president Joan Laporta’s key electoral promise finally fulfilled. Except that it is not quite, not yet. The agreement has not been made official and nothing has been signed, for one simple reason: it can’t be.

In his first TV interview, the prime minister’s former chief adviser said Johnson held out on reimposing Covid restrictions because “the people who are dying are essentially all over 80.”

Coronavirus – latest updates

Since early in the coronavirus pandemic, critics of unprecedented lockdown measures seen worldwide have argued that these interventions cause more harm than the disease itself. But an analysis of global health data suggests there is little evidence to support the idea that the cure is worse than the disease.
The analysis, published in the journal BMJ Global Health, considered claims that lockdowns cause more health harms than Covid-19 by examining their impacts on measures including death rates, routine health services and mental health.

My children are fascinated, learning how to spot clues to the speed, type and even sex of the animal, and join in excitedly when shown how to mimic the gait of different species: the galloping scamper of rodents, racing big cats and the slow lumber of a bear.

A team from Kannur Wildlife Rescuers (KWR) reached the boy’s home, in Ramatheru village in the coastal city of Kannur, within minutes and he was admitted to hospital 20 minutes later. He had been bitten four times by a venomous Russell’s viper, one of the “big four” snakes in India responsible for the greatest number of venomous snakebites.

Here we go again. Nearly 50 years ago one of us was arrested under the Official Secrets Act for working on a story for Time Out magazine, where the other one of us was the news editor. This led to the so-called ABC case, named after fellow reporter Crispin Aubrey, a brave ex-soldier whistleblower called John Berry, and the aforesaid Campbell. A lengthy Old Bailey trial followed in 1978 and, with it, a major discrediting of the use of the act against the press.
Soon after, the power of the pre-first world war, empire-era secrecy laws sank further when a jury acquitted the late Clive Ponting, a senior civil servant who sent MPs information about government deception during the Falklands war. A hasty law reform flopped in 2004 when evidence against the GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun had to be withdrawn at the last minute. The government feared her trial would reveal that it had been told the Iraq war would be illegal.

During the summer I turned 15, I fell into a prolonged depression that lasted well into my 20s. My mother, my two brothers and I had just arrived in London, and because we were seeking asylum as refugees, we were moved into a hostel for vulnerable families on Fitzjohn’s Avenue in the affluent north-west of the city. The journey to London had been so difficult that we had separated from my father, one of my brothers and my sister a few months earlier. The hostel was situated on a tree-lined avenue that connects Swiss Cottage to Hampstead village. A pleasant walk north takes you to Hampstead Heath and Keats House, to the south is Regent’s Park, where my family would walk around the park’s ornate rose garden and sit by the fountain, our favourite spot.
Four years earlier, in autumn 1992, my family had left our home in Kabul when the sudden withdrawal of US interests from Afghanistan left militias fighting for power, making ordinary life impossible. Once-frequent family gatherings had been reduced to funerals attended by a few. Food and water were scarce. We rarely left our home – the adults only went out on the most essential errands. My uncle sometimes cycled across the city to bring us drinking water as rockets fell around him. We would be worried sick until his return.

Across the North Sea in Denmark, Nationalbank has become so alarmed at this short-termism it has produced a series of warnings about the stability of its financial system. It says that long-term lending, 20 to 30 years, needs to take into account the climate crisis and the catastrophic write-down in the value of assets that may result from flooding.

Yesterday we told you about a major international investigation the Guardian has been working on with 16 media partners. It’s about a spyware company called NSO Group which has developed a piece of software called Pegasus that, once inside your phone, can turn it into a 24-hour surveillance device without you knowing.
Michael Safi hears from the Guardian’s Stephanie Kirchgaessner about the origin story of NSO Group – an Israeli tech startup that, so the story goes, in 2010 figured out a way to remotely access mobile phones after the founder became frustrated with the tech support available to him to fix his own faulty device. From there, the company developed what is now being called a military grade cyberweapon, Pegasus.

The government plans to strip National Grid of its role keeping Great Britain’s lights on as part of a proposed “revolution’” in the electricity network driven by smart digital technologies.
The FTSE 100 company has played a role in managing the energy system of England, Scotland and Wales for more than 30 years (Northern Ireland has its own network). It is the electricity system operator, balancing supply and demand to ensure the electricity supply. But it will lose its place at the heart of the industry after government officials put forward plans to replace it with an independent “future system operator”.

Instagram’s algorithms are pushing teenage girls who even briefly engage with fitness-related images towards a flood of weight-loss content, according to new research which aimed to recreate the experience of being a child on social networks.
Researchers adopting “mystery shopper” techniques set up a series of Instagram profiles mirroring real children and followed the same accounts as the volunteer teenagers. They then began liking a handful of posts to see how quickly the network’s algorithm pushed potentially damaging material into the site’s “explore” tab, which highlights material that the social network thinks a user might like.

The Israeli surveillance company NSO Group has created, developed and sold hacking software, known as Pegasus, that covertly allows access to mobile devices. Once it gains access, via hitherto unknown flaws in everyday apps, the code can extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones. Such is their ubiquity that mobile phones offer a window into our souls. What spyware, like that hawked by NSO, provides is access to our most intimate secrets.
One might have thought those peddling such intrusive powers would have imposed onerous responsibilities. NSO says that it only sells its software to vetted government clients to prevent “terrorism and serious crime”. Unfortunately, that does not appear to have been the case. And it’s not just NSO. Instead, an unregulated global industry has grown up in the shadows to provide cheap spying tools that were once the preserve of the most advanced state intelligence services.

Earlier this month, the German Greens unveiled an election poster designed to reassure voters who might be wary of their environmental radicalism. “Economy and climate without crisis”, went its slogan, suggesting that ambitious carbon reduction targets could be met without undue pain for jobs and industry. Days later, ecological crisis struck, in the form of the devastating floods that have overwhelmed western Germany, and parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. More than 190 people are so far known to have died, following flooding of an intensity and scale that has shocked scientists. The record levels of rain in north-west Europe followed record-breaking heat in the Americas. Extreme weather events are becoming the new normal, as climate models have long predicted. But some of the recent spikes have outstripped scientific predictions.
The eventual impact of the floods on Germany’s September election remains to be seen. But this disaster, which the country’s main political parties have broadly agreed was related to global warming, has thrust the climate crisis to the forefront of the campaign. On Sunday, Angela Merkel, who is standing down as chancellor, insisted that Germany needed to “up the pace in the fight against climate change”. Less impressively, the conservative frontrunner to succeed her, Armin Laschet, was caught on video sharing jokes with bystanders during a visit to a flooded town. As the president of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the worst-hit states, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union can make amends by getting to the bottom of a lethal failure to translate satellite warnings into evacuations on the ground.

I write as a retired GP of 34 years who has returned to work to try to help with the ever-increasing number of long Covid referrals. I, like many others, fear the inevitable rise in cases following “freedom day” today.
As shown by the recent research published in the Lancet and quoted by the Guardian (Long Covid has more than 200 symptoms, study finds, 16 July), long Covid is a complex and debilitating set of symptoms that is affecting mainly younger people. This was confirmed by the recent triage of referrals, which included people in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, who were in many cases affected so badly that they had not returned to work. Their family lives were severely affected and life for them was very different and reduced compared with their life before catching Covid-19. These people did not all have severe infections, and most of them didn’t even go to hospital.

Labour is wrong to oppose free speech legislation (Free speech bill gives legal protection to hate speech, says Labour, 12 July). Preventing appalling and obnoxious views from being heard is counterproductive. Does anyone really believe that those who hold such views are going to cease doing so by being prevented from expressing them, or that recruits are gained by their expression as opposed to those already holding deep prejudices?
Censorship tends to engender a sense of martyrdom, which helps to gain recruits from among those who think it must be worth joining far-right parties. The only way to combat racism and antisemitism is by taking them on in debate and demonstrating their falsities and unacceptability. I recall the outcry against the BBC for inviting the BNP’s Nick Griffin on to Question Time, but his views were demolished and he disappeared from sight. A refusal to take on the debate should only be supported by those who feel unable to sustain it.

On this day, known as Asar Pandhra, farmers begin the annual rice planting season and mark the day with various festivities such as preparing rice meals with muddy water; mud being a symbol for a prosperous season. Sixty per cent of Nepal’s agriculture industry relies on monsoon rain, while 40% is carried out through irrigation. Agriculture is a major contributor to the country’s GDP

In his inaugural address in January, Joe Biden promised to use his presidency to “restore the soul of America”. He would unite the nation, defuse “anger, resentment and hatred”, and lead Americans back to a world where they treated “each other with dignity and respect”.
Six months later, Biden is still preaching the unity gospel, and regularly assures his fellow Americans that “there’s not a single thing we aren’t able to do when we do it together”.

The Guardian reveals today a huge data leak showing more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to have been selected as persons of interest by government clients of NSO Group, which sells surveillance software. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 17 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project.
Investigative reporter Stephanie Kirchgaessner tells our new host Michael Safi how NSO Group’s clients have apparently selected journalists, activists and politicians in advance of possible surveillance.

As a rule, Marina Hyde doesn’t do TV, or radio, or podcasts. But she made an exception for Anushka Asthana’s last episode on Today in Focus, surveying the surreal range of characters who have dominated the political scene for the last five years: “The music has stopped in the middle of a deadly pandemic, and these are the people in charge.” From why Theresa May is like Vin Diesel to “cabbage patch Draco Malfoy” Boris Johnson, Hyde says: “Did I write that? I’ve got no memory of any of these.”
Still, she proves throughout that she is as funny and essential a guide to the era out loud as she is in her award-winning columns. As she says of Johnson: “I think he must be taken very seriously indeed. But you can do that through jokes.” (And as she says of Anushka: “We will all miss you so much. We really will.”)

The people in my life know me as the “sustainable” one. I’m the person who makes every decision guided by my ethics and concern for the environment. I quit fast fashion years ago, I eat a vegan diet, am strict about only buying from companies that pay their workers fairly, and grow most of my fruit and veg on my allotment. I’m not perfect by any measure, but I do try my best to make sure my actions align with my values. So, imagine my panic when I found out my pension could be funding fossil fuels, deforestation, arms and tobacco.
There’s an estimated £2.6tn in UK pensions, and much of that is funding actions and industries that I, and many others, strongly oppose. Most people don’t realise their pension money is even being invested, let alone that it’s being invested in industries that run against our values, threaten our health and jeopardise the very future of our planet. It’s likely there are pacificists out there unknowingly funding weapons and climate activists unwittingly handing money over to the fossil fuels industry.

Over the past year, something has happened when discussing work. You might have noticed it. New phrases have crept into our language, so when, for example, you’re working with a colleague on a project, you’re now “collabing”, and if someone makes an unexpected appearance in an online meeting (be that a co-worker, your unruly toddler, or even your cat) they’re “Zoom bombing”.
Yes, we all knew the pandemic would change how – and where – we work. But most of us didn’t realise that it was going to provide us with a whole new vocabulary to learn.

Like most people, Richard Curtis had never given much thought to what the money in his pension was doing. “I didn’t even know it was invested,” he says. “I think I thought it was in a vault, growing like moss, and there’d be a bit more there when it came out.”
The film-maker now knows that in fact, much of the £2.6tn in British pensions is invested in various businesses across the world. And, unbeknown to many of us, vast amounts of those funds have been fuelling unsustainable and exploitative industries from tobacco to fossil fuels, arms manufacturing to deforestation.

Give up flying, go vegan, get on your bike, grow your own – these are tried and tested tactics for reducing your carbon footprint. But there are plenty of other ways to boost your eco credentials that you may never have considered. If you’re looking to turbocharge your impact and find a different picture of what a low-carbon lifestyle looks like, here are five unexpected strategies to cut your carbon footprint.
1 Green your pension
There’s an estimated £2.6tn invested in UK pensions. You might not know it, but much of it funds environmentally harmful industries and activities such as fossil fuels or deforestation. Your pension may not seem like a powerful eco tool, but according to research by Make My Money Matter, Aviva and Route2, getting a green pension can be 21 times more effective in cutting your carbon footprint than giving up flying, going veggie, and switching to renewable energy combined. In fact, this research shows it’s the most powerful step an individual can take to reduce their carbon. And it’s not just a high-impact activity – it’s also popular. More than two-thirds of us want our money to support people and the planet. By pressuring your provider to invest more sustainably, or finding a more climate-friendly option, you’ll be able to sleep easier knowing your pension is now a force for good.

A recent audit of the condition of schools buildings in England found that the repair bill had risen to more than £11bn, which represented a significant increase on an estimate from 2017. We want to find out more about the state of school buildings to investigate whether this is becoming a day-to-day issue for pupils and teachers, and how the extra pressures of the pandemic may have had an impact.
We are interested in all aspects of the state of the nation’s classrooms, but past issues have included the long-term use of “temporary” cabins, the removal of asbestos, lighting, leaks and IT repairs, as well as boilers and air conditioning.

Boulos has helped lead and organise two mass demonstrations already in the past month and will be at the forefront of a third protest this Saturday. Tens of thousands of people are expected to turn out.
